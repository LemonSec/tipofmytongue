00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,720
hello i'm tina zang and i'm going to

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,799
talk about classical proofs of quantum

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,919
knowledge

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,440
this was joined to work with thomas

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,399
vedic at caltech

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,400
so this is the rough outline of the

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,920
presentation it's also the rough outline

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,520
of the paper

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,039
and in this paper we're interested in

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,960
defining classical proofs of quantum

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
knowledge

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,480
um so many of you might be familiar with

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,680
periods of knowledge in the purely

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,439
classical setting

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
here we're interested in looking at

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
versions of proof of knowledge where the

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
verifier is classical

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,719
but the witness

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
is a quantum state and not a classical

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,800
string

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,680
so

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
after we define these objects we're

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,719
going to show some properties of the

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
definition which have simple proofs and

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
then finally we want to show an example

26
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,559
that instantiates the definition

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
okay so here's the canonical setup in

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,520
the classical setting

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,879
there is approver p who wants to prove

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,480
to a verify v

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,039
that it knows a secret key

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,280
some publicly known public encryption

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
key pk such that pksk is valid

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
and how do we formalize the notion that

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,119
the tuple pksk is valid

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
the answer usually is that there's a

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
public mp relation r

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
which takes in

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
instance witness pairs and checks that

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
the witness w is indeed a witness for

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,159
the instance x

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,600
so we encode

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
the public key as the instance x and we

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,880
encode the secret key as the witness

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
so in this case the instance is a graph

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
the witness i've chosen three colorings

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
so the witness is the coloring of the

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,600
craft

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
that only uses three colors such that no

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,360
edge has two endpoints of the same color

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,119
so this encoding makes sense in the

52
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,840
context of typical classical public key

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
encryption schemes such as you know this

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,280
is an example using diffie-hellman um

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
hopefully it's clear why

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
this encoding is is a natural one in the

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
in the case of this particular

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
application

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,799
so this is the general setup um

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,800
but what is the proof of knowledge so

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
it's a protocol between the approver and

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,920
the verifier

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,599
intuitively it has a security property

64
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
that the verifier accepts if and only if

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
the proofer really does know

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,599
w the witness and we'll formalize what

67
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,200
it means for the privilege to know w in

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
a second

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
so this protocol can be trivial if we're

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
not concerned about zero knowledge you

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,480
know the proof we can just send this

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
witness to the verifier

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
but if we do want to hide the secret key

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
from the verifier then we might have

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
something a bit more involved

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,800
okay so now let's formalize what it

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
means to say that the prover really does

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
no w

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
so this is a basic setup there's an

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,480
efficient machine called the extractor

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,120
whose job it is to compute w

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
and the provo is modeled as a black box

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,120
so the extractor only gets to test its

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
input output behavior

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
however the extractor gets to rewind the

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,760
prover if it wants so it can replay one

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
of the rounds with a different message

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
for example and see what the prover does

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
under the new circumstances

90
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
so this is to give it more power um than

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
the the real verifier so if the protocol

92
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,000
zero knowledge you don't want the real

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,519
verify computing the witness which is

94
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,720
what the expression is supposed to be

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
doing

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
so if after interacting with

97
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,720
the proof of p

98
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
for a polynomial number of steps and

99
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,879
doing polynomial additional computation

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,720
the extractor can output the witness and

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,159
we say that p knew the witness because

102
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
it was able to pull

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
it was possible to pull the witness out

104
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,119
of the prover efficiently

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,120
so it's just a couple of quick remarks

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
you know classical piece of knowledge

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
are useful as building blocks and many

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
other protocols such as identification

109
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
protocols signatures and cca secure

110
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,239
encryption

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,599
and they have been considered and proven

112
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,440
secure in the post quantum setting so

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,040
for example see 2012 when rose paper

114
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,400
our focus here is different and we want

115
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
to look at proving quantum knowledge not

116
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
just post-conscious security so i'll

117
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
make some more remarks about that

118
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,959
shortly

119
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,319
but basically it means that the witness

120
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,519
will be a quantum state instead of a

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
classical string

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
okay so now we want to look at how we

123
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
want to to define classical proofs of

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
quantum knowledge

125
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,519
um so

126
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,040
the first application we might think of

127
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,319
for something called a proof of quantum

128
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,360
knowledge

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,439
is proving knowledge for a qma witness

130
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,478
so qma is the quantum analog of np if np

131
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,680
is the class of problems that can be

132
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
efficiently checked by a classical

133
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
verifier given a classical string as

134
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,919
witness

135
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,440
qma is a class of problems that can be

136
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
efficiently checked by a quantum

137
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
verifier it's given a quantum state as

138
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
witness

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
so how would we go about letting the

140
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
prover prove that nose are witnessed to

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
some instance of the qma complete

142
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
problem

143
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
in other words how do we translate the

144
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,240
mp primitives to the quantum setting

145
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
the first step of course is to replace

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
the classical witness string with a

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
quantum state bro that's the witness

148
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,840
that the proofer wants to prove

149
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,199
knowledge of

150
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
we also need to replace the instance of

151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
the mp complete problem so i used

152
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
recoloring my earlier pictures with an

153
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
instance of a qma complete problem so

154
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,000
for example this can be a local

155
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
hamiltonian

156
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,000
and finally we need to replace the mp

157
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
relation which checked whether witness

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,720
instance pairs were actually valid uh

159
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
with with a so-called qma relation so

160
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
it's basically a quantum circuit that

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
performs the same function as the

162
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,120
classical relation r takes in an

163
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
instance and a witness

164
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
has input and outputs whether or not the

165
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,719
x zero pair is valid

166
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,080
so a few remarks about proving

167
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
knowledge for qma witnesses

168
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
um again the situation is not to be

169
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
confused with uh post quantum classical

170
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,000
knowledge

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
uh there you want to prove knowledge of

172
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,639
a classical string but consider

173
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,080
potentially cheating quantum improvers

174
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
and verifiers

175
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
um here we're proving knowledge of a

176
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
quantum state

177
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
um one remark is that there is no longer

178
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
a trivial non-zero knowledge protocol to

179
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
proof knowledge of a qma witness if we

180
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,479
restrict to classical communication

181
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,680
which is what we're interested in doing

182
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
in this paper

183
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
so of course if we allow quantum

184
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
communication the prover can just send

185
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
the witness says before but with

186
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
classical communication it's not easy to

187
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,759
see how this could be done

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
in the last remark um for this

189
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,479
application we basically just went and

190
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
translated all of the mp primitives to

191
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
their direct equivalence in the quantum

192
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
setting but we might want also to look

193
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
at scenarios which are more uniquely

194
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
quantum and we'll look at these one of

195
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
these now

196
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
so here's a second application we looked

197
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
at in this paper

198
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,440
in this situation we have a quantum

199
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
money scheme

200
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
and the approval wants to prove that it

201
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,479
has a quantum money state

202
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
so just in case you haven't seen quantum

203
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
money before so we have an all-powerful

204
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
trusted entity called the bank

205
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
which mints bank notes that are quantum

206
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
states

207
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
and we imagine that the bank gives a

208
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
banknote state to the approver um for

209
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
example as interest on the proof of

210
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,800
savings

211
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
and some time passes

212
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
then the approver comes back and wants

213
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
to spend that bank note and the bank

214
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
wants to verify that the bank that the

215
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
through hand's in is legitimate

216
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,720
so wants to know that the approver

217
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
hasn't tampered with the banknote or

218
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,880
tried to counterfeit one to forge one

219
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
so they execute a protocol in which

220
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,319
loosely speaking the prover proves to

221
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
the bank that it quickmarks has the

222
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
banknote which was given to it before so

223
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,919
often this protocol is really just you

224
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,759
know one round where the approver sends

225
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,199
the banknote

226
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
and then the bank applies some quantum

227
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,479
measurement to it and accepts if the

228
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,720
measurement accepts but we'd also like

229
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
to consider in this paper protocols

230
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
which only involve classical

231
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
communication in order to verify these

232
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
banknotes

233
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,319
so why does the banknote have to be a

234
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
quantum state because we want to exploit

235
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,039
no cloning to make uncountable money

236
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,479
so if the banknote were a classical

237
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,759
string the approver could just copy the

238
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,039
string endlessly

239
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,560
and unless the bank remembers every

240
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,840
interaction that it's ever had the

241
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
prover could cheat and spend more money

242
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
than it's meant to have

243
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,479
but quantum states can't be easily

244
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,560
copied so we can design a scheme such

245
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
that after being given one back node

246
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
let's say of n qubits

247
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,759
p the prover can pass once in the

248
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,319
verification protocol here but it cannot

249
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,000
produce any two end qubit states such

250
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
that two copies of verification applied

251
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,759
to the first end and the last encubais

252
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,960
respectively

253
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
by the bank

254
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
will both pass verification

255
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
so here's an example of such a scheme to

256
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
make things concrete it was invented by

257
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
visner in 1983. a banknote is an n qubit

258
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,199
state

259
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,039
each qubit of that n qubit state is

260
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
drawn uniformly at random from the set 0

261
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
1 plus and minus

262
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
question how would the bank make such a

263
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,080
state well one way would be to write

264
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
down some random classical string x

265
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
and then apply a harmon gate with to

266
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
each qubit with half probability

267
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
to verify the sync note the bank would

268
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,759
need to remember the qubits to which it

269
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
applied hadamards

270
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,639
then it would unapply the hadamards that

271
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,400
it applied and measure in the standard

272
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,240
basis and then check that the classical

273
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
string that it got was x

274
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
so with this verification procedure the

275
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
maximum probability that the proofer can

276
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
prove produce two in qubits such that

277
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
the first and last in qubits

278
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
independently past verification this

279
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
verification procedure we just described

280
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
um is three quarters to the end this was

281
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,279
shown

282
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,440
in 2012

283
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
by

284
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,440
i think what true sotel

285
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,279
okay so that's a relatively interesting

286
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,800
situation where we have as prover

287
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
wanting to prove in some sense that it

288
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
knows or has a quantum state

289
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
and we already saw one way to generalize

290
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,399
the classical notion of proofs of

291
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
knowledge to the quantum setting

292
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
does this situation this quantum money

293
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
situation fit into that formalism so it

294
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
turns out that for any visa money state

295
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
for example

296
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
we can write down an instance x of a qma

297
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
complete problem such as local

298
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
hamiltonian and a qma relation such that

299
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,519
you know um q of x and the money state

300
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,279
equals one if and only if the dollar

301
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,120
state really is the money stream

302
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,320
however

303
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
if we were to then publicly disseminate

304
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,200
x the instance in q this relation this

305
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
would break the security of the scheme

306
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
so basically x and q would tell you the

307
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
qubits to which the bank had applied

308
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
hard amounts um in the beaster example

309
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,880
um and given that knowledge is quite

310
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
easy to counterfeit a visa money state

311
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
so on the other hand if we don't make

312
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
its x and q publicly known it's not even

313
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
clear what the prover should be proving

314
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
knowledge of

315
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,519
you might say at this point okay why

316
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,800
don't we have an oracle or something to

317
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
make it well defined without giving out

318
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
the secret information

319
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
but that's not allowed in the canonical

320
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
qma formalism and the in there the

321
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,760
instance and the relation are supposed

322
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
to be publicly known so basically in

323
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,360
order to make our definition of a proof

324
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
of knowledge broad enough to capture

325
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,920
both

326
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,839
quantum money and qma we borrow a

327
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,519
formalism called the agree improve

328
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,640
formalism

329
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
i won't dwell on this um

330
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
in the interest of time but it was

331
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,560
invented by berdercher josten mauro in

332
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,079
order to capture in the classical

333
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,680
setting situations that don't fit neatly

334
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,079
into the mp formalism and this framework

335
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,079
turns out to work nicely as well for our

336
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,560
purposes here

337
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,160
okay so we want to broaden our

338
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
definition of a proof of knowledge

339
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
because crypto in the quantum setting

340
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
might involve new tasks that aren't well

341
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,880
captured by a direct translation of the

342
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
mp formalism that's the first issue

343
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
surrounding translating the idea of

344
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
proofs of knowledge to the setting where

345
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,040
the witness is a quantum state

346
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
there's also a subtlety surrounding

347
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
defining black box access to the prover

348
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
when the prover is quantum but only

349
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
outputs classical information

350
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,399
so

351
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,160
if we only let the extractor look at

352
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
classical transcripts the question is

353
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,399
how will it get a quantum witness out

354
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
that seems as hard as quantum state

355
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
demography which is hard which in

356
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
general requires exponential um an

357
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
exponential number of measurements on

358
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,959
the state

359
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,720
so we must allow some sort of quantum

360
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
access to the prover

361
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,200
and

362
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,880
we use a solution to this problem that's

363
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,079
similar to solutions which were

364
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,279
considered in

365
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,519
um benru 2012 also watchers 2009 um

366
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
and but we use this definition in ways

367
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,959
that were allowed in both these

368
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,320
definitions before but not completely

369
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,519
explored

370
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
so i'll go over the definition so that

371
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,480
we all have the model clear

372
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,760
so here's how we model the proofer in

373
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
this definition we consider it to

374
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
consist of a private register uh in

375
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,120
which you can put any quantum state it

376
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,839
likes and a message register

377
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,680
which is used for exchanging messages

378
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
with the verifier so we'll see how in a

379
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,040
second

380
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
we assume the proof is private register

381
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
is initialized to some arbitrary state

382
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
and that the message register starts off

383
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,040
initialized to zero

384
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
so how does interaction work

385
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
we assume that the prover is entirely

386
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
characterized by unitary operation use

387
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,079
of p

388
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
which it applies in every round

389
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
so let's say the protocol starts now and

390
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
that the prover sends the first message

391
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
the first thing that happens is that the

392
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,320
proof of applies user p

393
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
and it acts on both the private and the

394
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
message register it could be entangling

395
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
these whatever

396
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,519
after user p is applied some trusted

397
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
party measures the message register in

398
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
the computational faces this results in

399
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
a classical string

400
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
and that's the message that the prover

401
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,839
sends to verify

402
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,360
so then the verifier processes this

403
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
message and puts the message that it

404
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,160
sends back to the proven the message

405
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
register

406
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,040
replacing the message that was there

407
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
after the measurement um

408
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,880
here

409
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
and then we apply user p again and

410
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
measure again in order to get the next

411
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
proof of message etc

412
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
okay so here's how p would be available

413
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,560
to the extractor

414
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
so p starts out initialize the way it

415
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
would be in the real protocol

416
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
the accelerator can read and write

417
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279
arbitrary quantum states of the message

418
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,800
register but cannot access the

419
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
approver's private register and that's a

420
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
justification for our black box

421
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
terminology

422
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
however the extractor can command the

423
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
privilege to do one of two things apply

424
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,120
user p controlled on some state which

425
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
the extractor provides or apply user p

426
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
dagger again controlled

427
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,000
so this is the analog of rewinding since

428
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
user p dagger is the inverse operation

429
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,240
in user p

430
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,279
and

431
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,959
note that both these unitaries act on

432
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
the private and the message register so

433
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,760
the extractor never gets to see the

434
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
private register but it can act on it

435
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
indirectly through user p

436
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
and it can also put an arbitrary state

437
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
in the message register and it doesn't

438
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
need to be a classical string

439
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
so the classical verifier would only

440
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,560
ever put a classical string there but

441
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
the extractor can put anything so this

442
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
possibility was allowed in previous

443
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,560
works

444
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
but not really used and as far as i know

445
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
this is the first time anyone actually

446
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
uses this capability in a meaningful way

447
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,760
and a proof of security so that's what i

448
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,720
was referring to earlier

449
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,120
as before we expect the extractor to

450
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
output the witness state at the end of

451
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,359
the interaction

452
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
okay so that's basically it for the

453
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
definition of a classical proof of

454
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
quantum knowledge

455
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
and we've defined black box access in a

456
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
meaningful way and we've expanded our

457
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,399
setup a bit to allow for more flexible

458
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
interactions between prover and verify

459
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
in order to capture quantum money as

460
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,199
well as qma

461
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,639
so one of the things we do in this paper

462
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
is prove some simple properties of

463
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,600
classical proofs of quantum knowledge as

464
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
defined in this way i won't dwell on

465
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,839
this in the interest of time but i will

466
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,680
describe them briefly

467
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
so the first one is if the classical

468
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,959
non-destructive proof of knowledge

469
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
exists for a witness state then the

470
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
witness state can be cloned by an

471
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
unbounded adversary

472
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,920
so non-destructive here just means that

473
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,519
the witness state is not damaged by the

474
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
protocol and the protocol can be run and

475
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
arbitrary a number of times without the

476
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,440
proof of having to produce fresh witness

477
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
states so this has consequences in the

478
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,959
quantum money setting because a lot of

479
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
quantum money protocols are information

480
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
theoretically secure

481
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,160
specifically it means set

482
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
non-destructive and also non-interactive

483
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,000
classical protocols or proving knowledge

484
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
of quantum money states can't exist

485
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,480
the second property

486
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
might be somewhat expected that if you

487
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
can show a proof of knowledge under our

488
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,760
definition then it is also a quantum

489
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
money verification procedure

490
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
so a quantum money verification

491
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
procedure remember says that you can't

492
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
pass twice if you only have one

493
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
money state the proof of knowledge says

494
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
that if you can pass even once then it's

495
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,680
possible to efficiently compute a

496
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
witness date from you so this lemma just

497
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,759
formalizes the intuition that the proof

498
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,639
of knowledge is stronger than the

499
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
quantum money verification procedure

500
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
with with some loss in parameters

501
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,519
okay so now we come to an example so

502
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,959
we've settled on a definition we've

503
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,320
proven some properties that it has but

504
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
we want to show that there are actually

505
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
protocols which instantiate the

506
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
definition

507
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,519
we also want to explore the kinds of

508
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,720
techniques that might be useful for

509
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,160
analyzing protocols that we want to show

510
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
our proof's quantum knowledge

511
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,800
so

512
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
we show several examples in the paper

513
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,600
but i'm just going to go through one of

514
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
them

515
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
so let's recall reasons quantum money

516
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
the money states look like this in cubit

517
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
song

518
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,440
i'm going to introduce some notation

519
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
that will be useful so remember earlier

520
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
we said a visa state can be generated by

521
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
the bank if it's like some classical

522
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,399
string x uniformly at random

523
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,560
and then apply zahata mod to each qubit

524
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
with half probability

525
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
so this is just saying you know the

526
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
string x chosen uniformly at random and

527
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
then there's a string theta which

528
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,199
encodes the qubits which had hadamards

529
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,480
applied to them

530
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,440
and

531
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
if the bit if the i bit of theta is one

532
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
then that qubit had a heart amount

533
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
applied otherwise it did not

534
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,639
and

535
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,040
x and theta completely specify the visa

536
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
state in terms of classical strings so

537
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,160
the bank can keep these strings around

538
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
to verify the dollar state when it needs

539
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
to do that

540
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
okay so now let's look at a protocol

541
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,480
which might we think might be a proof of

542
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
quantum knowledge for a visa money state

543
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
so the verifier issues a challenge to

544
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
the prover which is a uniformly random

545
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,680
string

546
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
c

547
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,440
it's n bits long and then the honest

548
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
river does the following it simply

549
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
measures the visa state and the base is

550
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
determined by cu where i mean that if

551
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,880
the eighth bit of c is zero it measures

552
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,320
in the computational basis otherwise it

553
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
measures in the of my basis and then the

554
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
verify checks that whenever

555
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
the ith bit of c is equal to the i third

556
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
of theta the i third of the prover's

557
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
response is equal to x sub i

558
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
so note that the honest prover gets

559
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,000
deterministic measurement outcomes x sub

560
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,640
i

561
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
exactly for the ice cube if c sub i is

562
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,799
equal to theta supply

563
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,199
and otherwise it gets random outcomes um

564
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,720
uniformly at random

565
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,119
because c sub i is equal to theta sub i

566
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
is just saying that they prove to

567
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
measure the i qubit in the so-called

568
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
correct basis the uh the basis that the

569
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,919
bank prepared that qubit in and

570
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,360
otherwise it measures in a basis that's

571
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
rotated so it gets a random outcome so

572
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,039
given that information hopefully the

573
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
verifies check makes sense

574
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,880
okay so how do we prove that this

575
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,600
protocol is a proof of quantum knowledge

576
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
i'm going to describe a thought

577
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
experiment here

578
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
we're going to eventually relate the

579
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,799
thought experiment to the real protocol

580
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,000
in a way that says something about the

581
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,679
real protocol

582
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
um so let's rename our parties first of

583
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,480
all let's call the bank alice

584
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,799
and it's called the proverb

585
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
and recall in the real protocol alice

586
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,679
generates two strings theta and x

587
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
uniformly at random and then she

588
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
constructs the v money state from them

589
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,799
according to the formula we described on

590
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
an earlier side this one

591
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,559
and then she sends the money state to

592
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
bob

593
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
now here's the thought experiment

594
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,679
imagine that instead of making a money

595
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
state in the way we just described alice

596
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
generates n epr pads

597
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
two n qubits

598
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
she sends half of each part to bob

599
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
and then she measures her halves in the

600
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
theta bases where theta is chosen

601
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,960
uniformly at random as before so theta

602
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
basis just means how to mod basis if

603
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
theta sub i is one and standard basis of

604
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,400
theta sub i zero

605
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,919
so hopefully it's easy to see that this

606
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,720
measurement causes the joint epr pairs

607
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
that alice and bob schar to collapse to

608
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
do copies of the money state

609
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,200
dollar sub x theta where x is uniformly

610
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
random it comes from the quantum

611
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
measurement um

612
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
and theta is the string that else chose

613
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
uniformly 100.

614
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
so far we've basically just described an

615
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
alternative way for alice to generate

616
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,720
the dollar state and send it to bob

617
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
but now remember we had this protocol

618
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
where alice sends a uniformly random

619
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
challenge c to bob and bob measures his

620
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
state in the c basis and tells alice his

621
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
measurement outcomes

622
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,000
so here's the important part note that

623
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
if bob passes in this protocol i.e he

624
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
tells alice the correct outcomes

625
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,120
um he recovers a subset of the string x

626
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
this one

627
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
um

628
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
which ellis in this thought experiment

629
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
obtained through a measurement on her

630
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
halves of the epr pairs

631
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
so it turns out that correlations like

632
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
these between else and bob

633
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
um

634
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
are a test for entanglement

635
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
what do i mean by that

636
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,520
so there's a theorem from natarajan and

637
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
vidiq

638
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
2016

639
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,480
which says that um

640
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
if bob and ellis exhibit correlations

641
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
like they do in the thought experiment

642
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
that we were just considering

643
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
then they once shared epr pairs up to

644
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
local isometry so local isometry just

645
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
means that

646
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,639
if you have some epr pairs

647
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,320
it means that they might you can apply

648
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,039
local reversible quantum operations

649
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,600
um on alice's halves this is alice or on

650
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
bob's halves this is bob

651
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
um but nothing that's you know applied

652
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,720
to the whole state um globally

653
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
so on both hills simultaneously

654
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
and so for alice the map on her side um

655
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,799
this is just

656
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
the identity since alice is honest and

657
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,080
she didn't do anything to her half of

658
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360
the epr pairs after she sent them to bob

659
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
uh for bob

660
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,440
uh we can efficiently apply the isometry

661
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
given

662
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,480
black box controlled versions of bob's

663
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
unitaries which is exactly the condition

664
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
that the extraction

665
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
definition gives us

666
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
this is all from the theorem

667
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
okay so what's the point of that

668
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,760
the point is that we have an argument

669
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
now for extraction so

670
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,039
firstly we argue that the thought

671
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,159
experiment

672
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
and the real protocol

673
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,919
are actually indistinguishable to bob

674
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,720
which means he must behave the same way

675
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,799
in both so that the two protocols are

676
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
indistinguishable should be obvious if

677
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
alice measures her halves of the epr

678
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,120
pairs temporally before bob measures

679
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,240
them since in that case the two

680
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
protocols um the imaginary one and the

681
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
real one are actually equivalent and we

682
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
just described a different way for alice

683
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
to generate the dollar state and send it

684
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,559
to bob

685
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
but even if she measures temporarily

686
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,640
after bob does he he still can't tell

687
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
between the thought experiment and the

688
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,400
real protocol because local operations

689
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,559
on epr pairs commute so we can just

690
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,559
commute else's measurement past bob's

691
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,960
measurement and then we're good to go

692
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,360
the second main point um this is the

693
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,799
theorem that we get from natarajan and

694
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,679
vitic

695
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,520
is that if bob passes in the proof of

696
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
knowledge critical in the thought

697
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,039
experiment world then there is a local

698
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,799
isometry phi b on his side

699
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,080
um

700
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,960
such that this equation holds

701
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
where psi a b

702
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,159
is the initial joint state of alice

703
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,080
involved in the thought experiment world

704
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,159
that's after ella's sent of the epr

705
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,080
pairs but before either ellis or bob

706
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
measured them

707
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
so the intuition is that in the thought

708
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,559
experiment world

709
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,480
ella sent half epr pairs to bob instead

710
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
of a money state and then bob might have

711
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,320
decided to apply some map to his side of

712
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
the epr pairs after receiving them

713
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
and the theorem from nataraj and vitic

714
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,320
2016 just says that there is a 5b

715
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
um which can recover the pairs

716
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
regardless of what bob might have done

717
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,039
to his side

718
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,679
provided that he was able to pass with

719
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,039
high probability in the proof of

720
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,799
knowledge protocol

721
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
so basically saying if bob passes we can

722
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,240
more or less figure out exactly what his

723
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
strategy was

724
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
okay so now here's a technical

725
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,320
calculation which i am going to skip

726
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,039
over but the punch line basically is

727
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,120
uh this um

728
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,320
you might have been wondering on the

729
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
previous slide okay

730
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,039
this one

731
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
okay in the ideal world the thought

732
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
experiment world if we apply this phi b

733
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,960
to bob's side we recover epr pairs but

734
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,559
what is the point of recovering epr

735
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,000
pairs in the ideal world we want to

736
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
recover the money state in the real

737
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,159
world

738
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
and this is just a computation which

739
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
shows that it shows how the two are

740
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
connected basically from this

741
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
computation we can deduce that if we

742
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
apply the same phi b

743
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
um to the initial joint state of alice

744
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
and bob in the real protocol

745
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,120
uh then we'll recover on bob's side the

746
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,400
money state

747
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,480
tensored with maybe some auxiliary state

748
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,799
on bob's private register

749
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,400
and this will be the money state on both

750
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
side will be in the message register

751
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,919
so the extractor's strategy is simply to

752
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,480
apply phi b

753
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
to bob's side using the black box access

754
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,559
to bob that it's given and then return

755
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,760
the state in the message register and

756
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,080
that's it

757
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
okay so now i'll just quickly go through

758
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,600
two other examples which we also showed

759
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,640
are classical proofs of quantum

760
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
knowledge so one of them is another

761
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,880
quantum money scheme

762
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
our proof strategy for the visa states

763
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,200
as you have seen is quite specific to

764
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
the structure of that particular

765
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
protocol but we are able to apply it to

766
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,400
one more example

767
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
so

768
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
the example is a modification of a

769
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
different quantum money scheme which is

770
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,279
based on these subspace states proposed

771
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,880
by aronson and cristiano in 2012.

772
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,120
since the technique worked pretty nicely

773
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
for the visa scheme the main difficulty

774
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,440
here with these different states is to

775
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,960
massage them to make them look enough

776
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
like the visa scheme to be able to apply

777
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
the technique so we don't exactly do it

778
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,880
for subsidy states but we do it for what

779
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
we call one-time padded subspace states

780
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,600
the third example which we analyze is

781
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
the celebrated mahdev verification

782
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
protocol for verifying quantum

783
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,640
computations so we show that this is an

784
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
argument of quantum knowledge for qma

785
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
relations that just means that the

786
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,799
soundness only holds against

787
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,039
computationally bounded proofs just like

788
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,039
the original maheret protocol

789
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,080
so mahadev's original analysis

790
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,840
showed that a computationally bounded

791
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
prover who passes in her protocol

792
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
guarantees that a witness exists

793
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,679
satisfying some qma relation

794
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,799
and we show that the witness can be

795
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,320
extracted from the approval of black box

796
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
passion and the proof uses technical

797
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,159
components that essentially already

798
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,760
existed in the mahadev protocol and we

799
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,960
just make the claim explicit

800
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,240
all right so that's all i would like to

801
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,360
say today

802
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,440
thank you

803
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,039
and if there are any questions please

804
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
feel free to reach out or to ask me at

805
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,000
the question session
