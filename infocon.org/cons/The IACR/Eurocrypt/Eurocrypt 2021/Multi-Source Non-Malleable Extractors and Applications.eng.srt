00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,800
hello everyone i'm changi and we're

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,560
going to introduce a work on

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,560
multi-cell's now malleable extractors

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,320
and its applications

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,639
this is a drawing work with repo guyo

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,079
and aksharin sweeney bass

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
so i will start by introducing what is a

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
true source now malibu structure the

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,560
notion is introduced by character and

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,840
swami in 2014.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
so in this setting you have two

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,320
independent weak random sources name the

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
x1 and x2 so here the weak means that

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,399
both source are not uniformly random

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
and then you want to use an extractor to

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
extract n bit randomness

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
from the sources that are close to

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,280
uniform

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,239
further

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,200
the

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
input sources can be tampered

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
independently by arbitrary tempering

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,160
functions

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
and the security requires that the

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
temperature output is either the same as

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
the original one or is independent which

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,039
means the value is destroyed

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,280
so here the ratherness of a source is

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
measured by its mean entropy

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
so if the mean entropy of the source is

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
greater than k then it means for any x

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,960
the probability that the source is equal

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,520
to x is less than 2 to the minus k so

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
intuitively the source has higher main

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
entropies means it contains more random

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
and we assume the x1 and x2 are ended

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,240
sources with mean attribute k they are

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,799
also called entry sources

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,280
and more formally the nominability is

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
defined as the drawing distribution of

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
the original output and the temporal

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,000
output is absolutely close to a joint

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
distribution of two and b string where

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,119
the first one is uniformly random and

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280
the second one is either the same or

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
independent of the first

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
and the epsilon here is called the arrow

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,039
of the nonmetabolic structure

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
so in this work we introduce a new

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
notion called multi-source non-metabolic

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,439
extractor which is the generalization of

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
the two shortest one and instead of two

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,639
source now we have as independent nk

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,840
sources

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
and similarly each source can be

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
tampered independently by arbitrary

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,959
functions

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
and then we can define the security in a

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
same way

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
however it is not hard to see that this

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
definition is actually weaker than the

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
two-shots one

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
since we can view such a multi-source

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,920
non-malibu structure by just applying

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
the true source non-malabar structure to

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
the first two sources and then ignoring

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
the rest

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
and in fact there's no previous result

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,879
considering cases beyond the independent

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,080
temporary

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
so in this work we mainly focus on the

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
following question

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
can we protect against the tempering

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,879
functions that can bring multiple

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,280
sources together

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
and then what is the main entropy is

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
required and what is the app

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,680
so the most general model one to

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
consider here is the overlapping joint

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
tempering

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
so in such a tampering for each eye the

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
tempering function can depends on an

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,920
arbitrary set of input sources ti

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
we also mentioned that this tempering

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
model is previously proposed by gary and

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,640
kumar in 2018 but it worked in the

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
context of non-valuable sql sharing

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,879
in the contact non-manageable extractor

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,280
no previous result considered this model

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
since they only considered two source

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
case

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
however it is hard to protect against

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
the general overlapping drawing

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
tempering so instead we consider a more

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
restricted tempering model called cover

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,799
free tempering which is overlapping

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
tempering with some constraints

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,680
so given overlapping tampering we say it

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
is i cover free if there exists an xj

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,200
said that no tempering set tk contains

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
both xi and xj

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
so for example here for i equal to 1 you

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
can see that x1 and x4 does not contain

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,599
an n at tk

105
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
this is cover free tempering if it is i

106
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,799
cover free for each ins

107
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,319
we'll see that this temporary model

108
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
includes a rich class of tempering

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,319
functions for example it contains the

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,920
independent tempering which already

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,280
mentioned before

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
and it contains this joint tempering so

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
this joint temporary means the sources

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,320
are divided into at least two groups so

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
that the sources in each group are

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,880
tampered together

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
also the cover free tempering is

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
strictly richer than the destroying

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
tempering as it contains some fancy

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
tempering functions such as following

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
the tempering of each x i

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
will depends on both x i and x i plus 1.

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
so it is not destroying tempering but it

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
is cover free since the x i is not

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
tempered together with the x i plus 2.

126
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,600
now i'm going to summarize the main

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
contributions the first introduce the

128
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
notion of multi-source normal extractor

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
and then we're given efficient

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
construction of the s-source

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
non-mediable extractor against the

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
cover-free tempering for any constant as

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
greater e42

134
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
the main entropy requirement of our

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
construction is linear a-n with

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,199
negligible arrow and polynomial output

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
lens

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
also the construction satisfied the

139
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
property called efficiently pre-image

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
sampable which means that given any

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,280
output one can efficiently do sampling

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
over its pre-image

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
using similar techniques we further

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
resolve some open problems in areas of

145
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
non-metabolized circuit sharing and

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
network structure which i will discuss

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
in more details now

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,199
for now malleable secret sharing the

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
notion is first proposed by

150
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,479
kumar in 2018 so in this setting suppose

151
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
you have a secret m and you want to

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
split the circuit into n shares with a

153
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
threshold t such that given any t or

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
more shares one can reconstruct the

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
secret m

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
and also

157
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
any t minus one shares contains no

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
information about n we call such a

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
scheme t auto event secret sharing

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
and further the nominal ability is

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
considered in a case that each sharing

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
might tempered by the adversary and the

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
security guarantees that any tempering

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
attacks either preserve the original

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
secret or completely destroy it which

166
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,720
means the secret recovered from tea or

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
more temperate shares are independent of

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,960
the original

169
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
for the prior work the original paper

170
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
considered only a restricted version of

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,840
destroying tampering more precisely

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,680
their construction does not work in a

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
case when the shares are divided into

174
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
two destroying tampering sets of equal

175
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
size

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,600
and in their follow-up work though they

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
can protect against cover-free tampering

178
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
their construction only worked for end

179
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
other and secret sharing

180
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,120
and in this work we give a construction

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
of t other than non-malleable secret

182
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
sharing against cover free tampering for

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
any t between two and n

184
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
we also show that our multi-source

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
non-malibu extractor can be used to

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
construct network structures that

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,759
improved over previous results

188
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
so the problem of network structures

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
naturally arise in the context where

190
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,039
they are pe processors and each has

191
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
access to a weak random source

192
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,520
independent of others and they want to

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
get uniform randomness by communicating

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,880
with each other

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
and further some processors might be

196
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,599
malicious corrupted which means they can

197
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
behave arbitrarily

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
and the security issue guarantees that

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
at least some of the audience processor

200
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,880
can output uniform randomness even given

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
all the messages sent during the

202
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
protocol

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
so for the prior work

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
either the construction cannot extract

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
uniform roundness for all on its

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
processor or it is in a computational

207
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
setting and requires exponential

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,759
hardness assumption

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,759
and in this work we give a construction

210
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
of network structure

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
i can always extract uniform randomness

212
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,720
for all on its processors and also a

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
work in information theoretical setting

214
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
and it can tolerate up to p minus two

215
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
malicious corruptions which is optimal

216
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,039
and it requires only a single round of

217
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,199
communication

218
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
so now i will briefly introduce our

219
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,639
construction for the multi-source

220
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
non-metabolic structure and give some

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,560
intuitions and ideas behind it

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
so our starting point is the following

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
construction

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
for simplicity we only construct three

225
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
source here and it's not hard to extend

226
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
the ideas to general multi-source

227
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,479
setting

228
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
so for three sources x1 x2 and x3 we

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,799
first force each source into two parts

230
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
as follows

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,399
and then for each x subscript i and y i

232
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,200
we use the two source number extractor

233
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
to extract randomness as zi

234
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,680
and finally we are actually all that

235
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,720
loose of d1 z2 and z3 to get the output

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
z

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
and then we'll see that each x subscript

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
i and y i are from different sources

239
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
and thus they are independent even given

240
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
the rest of the sources so there is a

241
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
hope that we can reduce the overall

242
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
security to the underlying two-source

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
non-malibu extractor

244
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
also this construction is efficiently

245
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,680
pre-image sampleable

246
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
if the underlying two-source

247
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
non-metabolic structure is efficiently

248
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,079
pre-image temperable

249
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,160
intuitively this is because the

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,800
construction has a tree-like structure

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,760
so for here given an output d one can

252
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,200
efficiently sample z1 z2 and g3 and then

253
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
we can do premium sampling on each two

254
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320
source nonmetal extractor to get the x

255
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,279
superscript i and y i and finally the

256
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,720
input source x1 x 2 and x3 can be

257
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
reconstructed from all the x superscript

258
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
i and y i

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
however there's a problem with this

260
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
construction so consider the case where

261
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
the input sources x1 x2 are tampered

262
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
together and x3 attempt independently so

263
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,800
this is a destroying temporary

264
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
since the first two input sources are

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
tempered together the x superscript i

266
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
and y i can be tempered together

267
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,079
this is a fatal problem since the

268
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
adversary now takes fully control of the

269
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
output of the first two source

270
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
non-metabolic extractor

271
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
for example it can temper the value of

272
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
the x superscript i and y i together so

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
that the temporal output z1 is equal to

274
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
the original z1 x always one

275
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
and then the final temporary alpha will

276
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,880
be also equal to the original output z x

277
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
always one which means that they are

278
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,800
strongly related but they are not the

279
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,720
same so therefore the security is

280
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
totally broken

281
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,560
so now i will introduce our main

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
construction and bypass the previous

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,079
problem

284
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,560
so instead of forcing each source into

285
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,800
two parts now we first hxi into xi1 xi2

286
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,040
xi3 and yi and then we compute

287
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,399
the x superscript i by xor the value in

288
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,399
the ice column

289
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,959
by doing this we'll see that each x

290
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,120
superscript i depends on all three

291
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
previous sources which means the

292
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
previous attack would not work

293
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
so finally the output z is computed in

294
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,040
the same way as in the previous

295
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,399
construction

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,720
also following similar idea we can show

297
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
that this construction is also

298
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,839
efficiently pre-image temperable

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
now i will talk about some intuitions

300
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,839
behind the security proof of our

301
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,360
construction

302
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
roughly speaking the goal here is to

303
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,920
show that the temporary output z-tuda is

304
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,720
either the same as the original output z

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,279
or is independent of it

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
and the main idea is to use in hybrid

307
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,639
arguments to show that each one of the z

308
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,720
one two that d two two and z three two

309
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
that is either equal to one of the z1 z2

310
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,399
d3 or independent of all of them then

311
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,959
there are two cases

312
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
the first case is that

313
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,200
all the z to the i as a permutation of

314
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
the original zi

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
for example suppose the z1 tutor is

316
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
equal to z2 c2 tilde is equal to z3 and

317
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
this 32 is equal to z1 in this case

318
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,959
we'll see the temporal output is the

319
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,079
same as the original output z

320
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
and the second case is that one of the z

321
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
ui is missing

322
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,639
so for example the two z1 is equal to z2

323
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,760
and to the z2 is equal to d3 however the

324
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,279
2.0 z3 is equal to some random variable

325
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,040
d that is independent of all z1 z2 and

326
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,079
d3

327
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,040
and in this case you can show that z2

328
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
is independent of z

329
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,360
so why it is the case

330
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,480
so one observation is that the z1 is

331
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,079
uniformly random given the z2 and z3

332
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,560
to prove it we can fix all the input

333
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,120
sources except it's y1 and x31

334
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
so then we will see that x3

335
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,720
and x2 are also fixed

336
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
which means that the z1 and z2 are also

337
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
fixed

338
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
then since the y1 x31 can still have

339
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,880
some randomness and they are independent

340
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
by the security of the underlying two

341
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
source non-malabar extractor the z1 is

342
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,720
close to uniform given the z2 and z3

343
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
and therefore given the z2 and d3 we

344
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
know that z2da will be fixed but the z

345
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,720
is still close to uniform

346
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,880
and thus it implies that d2 is

347
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,480
independent of z

348
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,199
so now i will give some intuition behind

349
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,760
the proof of the main hybrid argument

350
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
because the goal here is to show that

351
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,800
each one of the to the zi is either

352
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,519
equal to one of the vi or independent of

353
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
all of them

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
a key step improving above is to show

355
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760
the following so given the x to y 2 and

356
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,600
x 3 y 3 for each eye the d i tutor is

357
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
either equal or independent of the

358
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
original z1

359
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,320
the proof of this key step contains most

360
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
of the main techniques and therefore for

361
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,360
the rest of our talk we mainly focus on

362
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
the idea behind this proof

363
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
recall that the zi tutor and z1 are the

364
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
output from the two source down malibu

365
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,639
extractor

366
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,040
therefore the idea here is to reduce the

367
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
problem to the security of the

368
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
underlying true source now malibu

369
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
extractor

370
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
here is the rough proof idea so suppose

371
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,600
we consider the tempering function f12

372
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,399
and g3 where f12 tempered the first two

373
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,639
source together and the g3 temper the

374
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,440
third source independently the idea is

375
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
to first fix all the input sources

376
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
except the y1 and x31

377
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,199
then as we argued before the x

378
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,839
superscript 1 and y1 are independent

379
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,519
sources therefore in order to use the

380
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
property of the underlying non-metabolic

381
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
structure we just need to show that x12

382
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,279
and y1 tutor can be represented as an

383
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,959
independent time ring of the x1 and y1

384
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,480
so first for

385
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
the y 1 tutor and y 2 to the

386
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
so given y 1 since all the parts in x 1

387
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
x 2 are fixed by the tempering function

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
f 1 2 one can compute the y 1 2 and y 2

389
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,760
to

390
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,240
then let's consider the case for x 1 2

391
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,079
and x 2 2

392
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,320
so given the x 1 similarly to the

393
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
previous case

394
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
one can compute it x we want to that and

395
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,279
x 3 2 2 there however it is not enough

396
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,399
to compute the x1 to an x2 tutor since

397
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,199
they also depends on the values of the x

398
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,240
1 1 2 then x 1 to 2 and x 2 1 to the

399
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,880
next 2 2 2

400
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,759
and we cannot compute those values from

401
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,320
x1

402
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,959
then one observation here is that those

403
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,360
values can actually computed from y1

404
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
therefore the idea here is to view row's

405
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,720
temper value as leakage from the y1 and

406
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
use liquid resilient to source our mana

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,079
book structure

408
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,720
more formally here we use what we call

409
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
unbalanced leakage resilient to source

410
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,959
our malibu structure we'll give a

411
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
detailed construction of such a

412
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,000
malleable structure in about paper

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,720
so here the unbalanced means the input

414
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,120
sources have different lengths more

415
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
precisely we need the y

416
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,160
to be several times longer than x this

417
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
requirement is necessary if we want the

418
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
length of the leakage to be several

419
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
times of the length of x

420
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,560
and the tempering function is like the

421
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,399
independent tempering the only

422
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
difference is that now we allowed f to

423
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,360
depend on also on some leakage

424
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
information from y

425
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,040
and the security requirement is similar

426
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
to the original two-source non-malibu

427
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,199
extractor

428
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,160
so given the leakage we now can compute

429
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
x one two that and x to two does from

430
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
the x one

431
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
so finally for the case of x32 and y3

432
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,480
tutor using the previous idea we can

433
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
compute the actuator and the y-32 from

434
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,480
x1 and the leakage from y1 this also

435
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
implies that these three tutors can be

436
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,319
computed from y1 and the leakage

437
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,240
however none of x 3 2 and y 3 tutor can

438
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,200
be computed from y1

439
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
so to solve this problem the idea is by

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,559
letting the tempering function of y1 so

441
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,840
simply output a constant y star

442
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
this y star satisfies that for every

443
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,799
possible output one can always find a

444
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,080
proper x

445
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,919
that lets the two source non-malibu

446
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,120
extractor to output s given the second

447
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,679
sources is equal to y star

448
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
we show and have a paper that we can

449
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
always find such a white star with high

450
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
probability then for the tempering of x1

451
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,679
since it can compute the z3 tilde we can

452
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,320
also output an x that lacks two source

453
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
non-metabolic structure to output and z3

454
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,919
tutor

455
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
therefore we can actually represent the

456
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,919
tempering of these three as an

457
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,720
independent tampering from the source x1

458
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,360
and y1 which means that we can also

459
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,160
reduce the security to the underlying

460
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
two source non-manageable extractors for

461
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,039
this case

462
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
but by the end we briefly mentioned some

463
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
interesting open problems that related

464
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
to this work

465
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
the first is whether we can construct

466
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,600
multi-source non-malibu extractors

467
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
against tempering functions that beyond

468
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,600
the cover-free tempering

469
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,760
and the second one is in the setting of

470
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
multi-source non-manageable extractor

471
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
whether we can achieve lower main

472
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,840
entropy requirements say fully locking

473
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
the lens of each input source and final

474
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,960
one is are there other applications of

475
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,240
the multi-source non-manageable

476
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,240
extractor and thank you for listening
