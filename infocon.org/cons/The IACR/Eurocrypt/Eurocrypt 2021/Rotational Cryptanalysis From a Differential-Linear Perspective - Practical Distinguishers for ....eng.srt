00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,040
this is the presentation of our paper

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
rotational analysis in a differential

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,879
linear perspective

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
practical distinguishes for round radius

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,160
spirits voodoo and ardex

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
i am inven and this is a joint work with

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,880
situation and charlie

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,039
differential and linear chrome analysis

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
are the most general method to analyze

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,560
block cycles and they have many variants

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,558
including the boomerang and the

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,719
differential linear attack

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,480
these combined variants could be

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
stronger than pure differential or

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,000
linear ones

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
and they are especially effective in the

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,480
trails covering a smaller number of

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
rounds have a high probability but the

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,079
probability drops exponentially with the

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,480
increased brands

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
in this talk we will focus on

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
differentiating analysis

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,600
for

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
factorial volume function giving an

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,720
input difference delta and an output

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,000
mass gamma

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
we can build a differential linear

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
distinguisher by a linear approximation

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
on the output difference

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
and the probability of the distinguisher

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
is defined by the number of right inputs

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,439
accordingly we have the correlation as

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,119
r2 times p minus 1 and the bias is half

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,799
of the correlation

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
now the problem is how to estimate the

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
probability giving theta and gamma

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
often we split the cipher into two parts

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
in some cases three parts

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,040
with an intermediate layer connecting e0

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
and e1

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
in e0 we find a differential with

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,439
probability b and in e1 we have a linear

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
approximation with bias ips then the

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
total bias of the distinguisher is 2

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,680
times p times epsilon squared

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,479
this is a rough estimation and for a

47
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,880
better evaluation many new approaches

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,399
are proposed

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
for instance attacks on eric cipher

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,120
chesky were proposed uh in europe's 2015

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
and crypto 2020 using differential

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239
linear analysis with the partitioning

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,840
technique

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
in 2017 a

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
theoretical formula was proved for

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
evaluating the differential linear bias

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
which requires to

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
enumerate the full intermediate mask

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,120
space

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
in 2019 the differential linear

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
connectivity table was proposed to

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,239
better evaluate the middle layer between

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,000
a0 and a1

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
in 2015 it was noticed that the

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,440
theoretical and experimental

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,640
differential linear bias have a huge gap

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,400
due to dependency and this problem uh it

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,319
was answered in a very recent crypto

69
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,239
2021 paper from an algebraic viewpoint

70
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,360
so our motivation for this paper is to

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,319
force

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,959
how to extend the framework of

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,920
differential analysis and can we improve

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,319
the accuracy in the bias evaluation

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,560
before further discussion i will first

76
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
explain rotational analysis we will

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
later show its connection with

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
differentiating

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,159
rotational analysis was proposed in 2010

80
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,120
for ax first based on a rotational

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
property of modulation

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,560
then

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
malwiski applied a rotational analysis

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
on kitchen

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
a following works

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,720
on rotational condenses were proposed

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
further applications of the technique

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
and in several papers on rotational x

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
analysis it was shown that the rotation

90
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,760
of analysis can be regarded as a general

91
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,239
realization of differential processes

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
where a rotational difference replaces

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,280
the

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
xor difference

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
the definition of a rotational actual

96
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
difference is to add a rotation on one

97
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,840
operand

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
when the rotational amount is zero then

99
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
it generates two ordinary exterior

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
difference

101
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,918
having the rotational difference in mind

102
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,720
what we do next is to generalize the

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
differential linear group analysis by

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
replacing the x-ray difference to

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
rotational difference

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
so we proposed rotational differential

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,199
linear analysis we are giving a pair of

108
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
rotationally related inputs x and x

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,800
prime

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
we study the linear approximation with

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
mass gamma on their output difference

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,919
through the side

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,160
as this formula

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
here

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
and accordingly we define the bias of

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
such distinguisher by the probability

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
minus half

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
now we can see that rotational

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
differential linear is a generalization

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
of differential linear because when the

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
rotational amount is zero the

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,680
distinguisher becomes this differential

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
linear distribution

124
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
we will come back to this observation

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
later

126
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
so can we borrow the differential linear

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,199
bias combination here

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,680
we tried the first approach

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
in fact we can borrow it the previous

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
idea on differential linear of

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
separating a cyber into two or three

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
parts

133
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
and we find good

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
rotational differentials and linear

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
approachment approximations to

136
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
concatenate

137
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,639
so here is a detailed deduction on the

138
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
com on computing the bias assume that we

139
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,080
have a good rotational differential on

140
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
the first half of the cipher and a good

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,720
linear approximation on the second half

142
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
it can be shown that a similar formula

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
can be achieved but instead of the bias

144
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,479
of the linear parts

145
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,759
squared we have two linear biases here

146
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
and where the masks are rotated

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,440
but using this formula can be inaccurate

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
in some cyphers because we didn't

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,319
consider the connectivity effect

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
so

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
uh

152
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
we further prove a link between

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
rotational differential and linear

154
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
object approximations and extend the

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
previous formula on differential linear

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
to rotational differential linear aspect

157
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,280
uh the detailed proof can be found in

158
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,639
the paper on imprint here

159
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,280
this theoretical formula

160
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,160
gives a unified view on rotational

161
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,759
differential linear and differential

162
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,720
linear

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,680
in practice it will still require us to

164
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
enumerate all intermediate linear masks

165
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,319
and unlike differential probability

166
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,440
the correlations are signed so a

167
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,120
summation over a subspace of linear mass

168
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
masks doesn't

169
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,039
reflect the real correlation over the

170
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,520
whole space considering the cancellation

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,199
so we decide to take it another approach

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,400
and it is based on the previous work by

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
maori ski

174
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
on rotational analysis with a

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,720
application to keep checking f

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
given a three-dimensional state a x y z

177
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
where the nonlinear operation is on the

178
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
x axis

179
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
we rotate the states on the d axis to

180
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
get a rotational pair

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
so in

182
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
other words the inputs rotational

183
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,560
difference is zero

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,479
the k-check f permutation without

185
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,240
constants is environment under

186
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
certification and aim is to find out

187
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
which position has a high probability

188
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,759
that output pair differs on that bit

189
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,479
there are three rules to compute

190
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,960
the probability that's output difference

191
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,120
being zero giving the probability that's

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
the input difference on certain bits are

193
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,240
zero through three

194
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,039
operations and operation xor and not

195
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
for instance here the probabilities for

196
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
the input difference between

197
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,639
1 is b and q for the end operation and

198
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,960
then after the end operation the output

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,440
difference is 1 with the probability

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
of p

201
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,679
plus q

202
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
minus p times q

203
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,958
divided by 2.

204
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
with this uh three rules we can predict

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
the probability of each output speed

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
spin and equal run by round

207
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,680
uh we first observed

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
that the rotational distinguisher on

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
kickstart f was a special case of

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,040
rotational differential linear where the

211
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
output mask is one bit

212
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,000
then our second observation is that the

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,640
probability of the output bit spin and

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,040
nickel through a boolean function can be

215
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,240
predicted by the following formula where

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
in the

217
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,399
summation the first term

218
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
shows the difference transition

219
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
probability and the second term here

220
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,279
gives the initial probability

221
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
distribution of the input difference

222
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
then our third observation is on the

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
effect that's the constants have

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,959
on the rotational pairs here i show an

225
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,240
example

226
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
uh to show the effects uh when

227
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
there are consecutive non-zero bits in

228
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,640
the constants like here zero zero one

229
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
one constant

230
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
it actually introduced a new rotational

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,839
difference which is the constant c x 4

232
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
with c rotated

233
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
because theta c this difference

234
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,519
if the bits of that rotational diff

235
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,800
rotational

236
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,440
difference is non-zero then we should

237
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,279
flip the

238
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
rotational differential linear

239
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
probability of the specific bits on the

240
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,800
state

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,439
and this is called the adjusted 0.

242
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
so giving on inputs rotational

243
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
difference theta the initial probability

244
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
is fully determined and we can evaluate

245
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
the wrong function by regarding it as

246
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
circuit with boolean operations so we

247
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
can compute the rotational differential

248
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
linear probability run by round

249
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
and to find out the position of the

250
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,160
output bits that is the most biased

251
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,120
here we show an example on zulu

252
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
permutation

253
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,320
zuru is a

254
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,560
lightweight permutation designed by the

255
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
kitchen team arranged in a 3 times 4

256
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
cube with 32 bits on each

257
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
one round of sudo has 5 steps where

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
except for the step 4 all the others are

259
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
linear

260
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
notice that the constant

261
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,320
addition

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
is before the linear layer we can

263
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
control the inputs or additional

264
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,959
difference such that the difference

265
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,040
before step 4 in the first round is zero

266
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
and that helps us to extend the

267
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
distinguisher one round for free so this

268
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
is the input difference rotational

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
difference you choose

270
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,279
so with this

271
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,680
input rotational difference

272
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,800
the rotational amount is said to be

273
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
one bit left and we get a four round

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
rotational differential linear

275
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
distinguisher with correlation one and

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
output mask is one non-zero bit on the

277
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,000
16 speeds of the cell 1 0.

278
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
next we are going one step further to

279
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
extend rotational differential linear

280
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
analysis to air x

281
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
first we'd like to mention that uh what

282
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,000
works for rotational

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
differential linear also works for

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
differential linear just with the

285
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
rotational amount being zero

286
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
so in this talk we will speak about the

287
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,839
differential linear

288
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,160
errors and the full discussion can be

289
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,959
found in our paper

290
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,200
to guess the probability propagation

291
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
rule for

292
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,120
um

293
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
addition modulus 2 to the n

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
we found that's the

295
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
the dependency uh in the carry function

296
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
cannot be ignored

297
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,760
here

298
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,399
uh so if we think we apply the three uh

299
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,639
n rules here and two extra rules here uh

300
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,800
then it will give us a biased estimation

301
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,519
so what we did is the following

302
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,040
using the observation 2 from

303
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
our previous slide

304
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
we deduce a capital

305
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
carry rule that takes the

306
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,560
dependency into full constitution

307
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
so given the probability of the input

308
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
difference being 0 you can predict the

309
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,440
carry difference being zero using this

310
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,800
uh

311
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
expression

312
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
then it it follows uh that's the modular

313
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
addition rule for differentiating your

314
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,399
propagation can be also derived here as

315
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,399
this

316
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
let's see an example

317
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
uh given the input differences between

318
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,240
seven and seven uh to uh eight bits

319
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,639
modulation and the probabilities that

320
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,959
the output difference bits are non-zero

321
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,000
can be computed as this table shows

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
and our experiment confirms the results

323
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,920
and this is particularly efficient for

324
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,519
modular editions with 64 bits or even

325
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,399
more where a direct combination of the

326
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,639
differential linear bias would be

327
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
computationally invisible

328
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
another interesting thing that's been

329
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,639
observed is that the differential linear

330
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,279
probability seems to have a rotational

331
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,839
behavior when the input differences

332
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
rotate

333
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
uh

334
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,839
rotate

335
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
for instance uh when we rotate the

336
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,120
difference 0 1 to

337
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
0 2

338
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,440
the resulting probability is also

339
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,480
shifted here

340
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,040
and this can be used to explain an

341
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
experiment experimental

342
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,399
results on the rotational probability

343
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
property in the differential linear

344
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
distinguishes of sigma

345
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,519
and we give a theoretical evaluation of

346
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,959
the found differential linear

347
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,000
distinguishes here

348
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,959
then

349
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,360
we apply rotational differential linear

350
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
analysis and the new measured of

351
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,480
evaluating the probability to several

352
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,440
cryptographic permutations here i show

353
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
the application of

354
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
rz for some more details

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
rzet is a 64-bit eric space permutation

356
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
presented in crypto 2020

357
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
it has two branches so each weighs 32

358
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,480
bits

359
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
the structure has only modular addition

360
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,959
rotation and xor

361
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,240
because our previous propagation rules

362
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,680
through the modular addition for

363
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
differential linear it contains

364
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
quadratic and higher degree terms

365
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,560
and also the size of this permutation is

366
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
not too large so we can actually use the

367
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
quadratic constraint programming in

368
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
group b to search for a good input

369
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,600
difference where our objective is to

370
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
minimize overall probability for all

371
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,360
one bits output masks and we observed

372
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,639
that the input differences with

373
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,000
low or high hemorrhage tend to give

374
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
better rotational differential linear

375
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,040
distinguishes in rzx and or we also

376
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
carry out experiments to compare the

377
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
probability with the theoretical

378
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,600
evaluation

379
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
for instance here we have input

380
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,199
difference

381
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,839
this this one in a differential linear

382
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
setting and the results are depicted in

383
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,720
the following figure the x axis is the

384
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
position of output difference from 0 to

385
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,680
63 and the y axis is the probability

386
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,639
the statistics show basically the same

387
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,360
pattern for theoretical evaluation and

388
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
experiment

389
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
and

390
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,079
and then overall of

391
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,079
all our applications can be found here

392
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,680
in this table

393
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,240
we found a certain round partition

394
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,919
differential linear distinguisher for

395
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,559
the permutation grades four round four

396
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,280
zooto and four round four assets

397
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,919
we tested the experimental probability

398
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,839
to verify the distinguishers whenever

399
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,679
possible the distinguishers

400
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,079
show an advantage over traditional

401
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,079
differential differential or linear

402
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,480
distinguishes either in the number of

403
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
covered rounds or

404
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
the probability

405
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,240
to conclude

406
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
in this paper we proposed a rotational

407
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
differential linear quick analysis as a

408
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
generalization of differential linear

409
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
and the theoretical analysis on

410
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
rotational differential linear is given

411
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,440
then a new measure for computing the the

412
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
probability of rotational differential

413
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
linear distinguisher is presented which

414
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,960
is efficient by evaluating wrong by

415
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
round

416
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,720
finally our technique is applied to

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
three permutations where practical

418
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,280
distinguishes are obtained

419
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,240
thank you for your attention
