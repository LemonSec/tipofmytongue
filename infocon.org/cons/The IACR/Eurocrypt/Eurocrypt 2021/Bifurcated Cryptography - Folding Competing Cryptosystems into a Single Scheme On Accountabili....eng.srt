welcome to my eurocrypt 2021

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,720
presentation about bifurcated signatures

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,719
this is a joint work with benue aliber

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,360
from ens de leon in france

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
myself thomas peters from u silva in

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,439
belgium

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,760
in this talk i'm going to show that we

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,840
do not have to choose once and for all

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,320
between either a strong notion of

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
accountability or statistical anonymity

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
in a single private signing scheme

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
more generally our goal is to initiate

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
research on bifurcated

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
in more than two decades cryptographers

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
built more and more advanced protocols

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
but they can usually be divided into two

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,079
conflicting branches

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
on the one branch we have the primitives

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
for privacy aware users

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
such as end-to-end encryption or schemes

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
with unconditional anonymity or

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
everlasting privacy

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
and on the other branch

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
we have the primitive design to prevent

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
abusing the cryptosystem

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
where one would like properties such as

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,920
key escrow identity escrow or

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,439
accountability

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
sometimes motivated by safety reasons

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
still

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
each branch taken individually might be

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
the best solution in some context but

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
both rigid solution cannot live together

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,159
and it might sometimes lead to some

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,799
tensions

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
the goal of bifurcated cryptography is

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,960
to make both branches to live together

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
in a single scheme in a flexible and

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
user-friendly manner

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
of course given a commitment for

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
instance it is either perfectly hiding

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,439
or perfectly binding and never both at

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,800
the same time

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,038
dual mode commitment scheme exists and

49
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
makes a bridge between both branches

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
but it is usually a security feature

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
used in order to prove the security in a

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,599
broader protocol rather than a

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,480
functionality

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
in the case of anonymous signatures

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,879
cryptographer just created the best

56
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
solution that fits in a single branch

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
for statistical anomaly we have ring

58
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,640
signatures on the one branch

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
and for traceability we have group

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
signatures on the other branch where an

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,080
opening authority can identify the

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
actual signer on demand but it can

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,840
always do it at will

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
some works try to mitigate those

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,319
absolute properties in both branches and

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
i will briefly mention some related

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
rocks later but

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
the separation between both branches

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
remains strong

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
until today

71
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
the table exception

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
where both branches really coexist is

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
inaccountable tracing signatures

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
however the user received a single

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
signing key

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
which fixes the branch without being

77
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,680
aware of which

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
then we raise some questions

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
why should we choose the branch at the

80
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
key generation time

81
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,440
can we avoid authoritarially freezing

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,640
the targeted security notions

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,599
or can we have the best of both branches

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,238
in a flexible and rallying feature

85
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,959
to

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,439
answer this question we introduce

87
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,319
bifurcated anonymous signatures

88
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
in bifurcated animal signatures the

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,799
branch is selected by predicate at the

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,560
signing time

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,959
depending on the content and even on

92
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,680
some information related to the context

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
the predicate value determines point

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
wise whether the signature will fall in

95
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,280
the statistical anonymity branch or in

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
the traceability branch

97
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,959
moreover this predicate value is easily

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
computable by the signer

99
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
we can thus make an educated choice as

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,719
whether he or she can afford signing

101
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
from a privacy point of view we require

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,639
the bifurcated anonymous signature to be

103
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
branch hiding

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
that means that whether a signature is

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
traceable or not is hidden from the

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
outside

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
this allows the signer to make a free

108
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
choice as no one can tell whether he or

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,280
she accepts signing for one branch

110
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
or the other

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
accept the opening authority of course

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
we can figure it out by trying to trace

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
the signature

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
we also stress that revealing the branch

115
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
can give private information about

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
designers so this is also one more

117
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
reason to hide the branch

118
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
further we also require bifurcated

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
anonymous signatures

120
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
to satisfy the branch soundness notion

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,039
this is a security requirement which

122
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,840
ensures that malicious signers

123
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
even colluding with all the authorities

124
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
cannot flip the branch

125
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
and compute or implicitly force the

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
computation of a signature that should

127
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
fall in one branch while it finally

128
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
falls in the other branch

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
somehow it says that no one can cheat

130
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
with the predicate

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,199
upon

132
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
which

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,680
another signer can make a secure choice

134
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
as a side note on the meaning of

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
bifurcated

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
the miriam webster dictionary says that

137
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,719
it is actually two branches in one

138
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,759
more intuitively this is how bifurcated

139
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
and our signatures work

140
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
we have a group manager who creates some

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,479
credential for the user who belong to

142
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,080
the group

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
once enrolled a user can sign any

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,080
message

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,319
and before signing he or she can

146
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
evaluate the predicate

147
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
to know whether the signature will be

148
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,039
traceable or not

149
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
once he or she output the signature

150
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
anyone can verify its validity as in

151
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,440
normal ordinary signature

152
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,120
this process

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,759
is actually dynamic

154
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
a new user

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,520
can come and join the group by first

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,440
creating a secret usually a signing key

157
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
and will get the credential usually a

158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
group manager's signature on the user

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
verification key

160
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
traceable or not any signature computed

161
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,440
by a group member is at least

162
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,800
computationally anonymous from the

163
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
outside

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
the opening authority can try to

165
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
identify the actual signer behind any

166
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
signature if it does not find any

167
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,639
identity that means that the signature

168
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
is statistically anonymous

169
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
otherwise it should always find one

170
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,280
identity

171
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
basically a bifurcated anonymous

172
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
signature is a flexible mix of ring and

173
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
group signatures so

174
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,919
let's have a quick view on the state of

175
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,199
the art

176
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
so for group signature the concept has

177
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
been introduced in 1991 by shuman

178
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,440
vaneste

179
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
in 2000 natanzee kamenish juwa in sudik

180
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,479
gave

181
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,879
a construction resistant against the

182
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
coalition

183
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,440
but the security analysis was made with

184
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,599
respect to a list of security

185
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,879
this is only a few years later

186
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
in 2003 bella mitchiancio

187
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
and ravinsky proposed a

188
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,560
security model and the construction

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
based on trapdoor permutation

190
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
but at that time the group's signature

191
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
was only static that means that it was

192
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
not possible to join the group

193
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,919
and so the group was frozen

194
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
at the key generation time

195
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,440
so it is just a few years after that the

196
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
extension to dynamic group have been

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
proposed with a formal model and

198
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
construction as well

199
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
so that is for the group's signature and

200
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
for ring natural concept i've been

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,880
introduced in 2001 by rifest chamir and

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
toman

203
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
the the purpose was to show how is it

204
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
possible to leak a secret and keep the

205
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
anonymity in an unconditional

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,240
way so in a statistical way and the

207
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
application there was to allow

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
whistleblowing

209
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,839
the

210
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,279
security has been in ends in 2007 and

211
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,040
actually a little before

212
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,480
and by ben derkatz and marceli who gave

213
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
stronger definition and construction in

214
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,760
the standard model

215
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
so this was for the basic notion somehow

216
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
of group entering signatures

217
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,839
but

218
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,000
variant have been suggested so far

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
usually to reduce the power of a single

220
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,839
entity

221
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
so in the case of group signature

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
several rocks proposed to restrict the

223
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
power of the opening authority

224
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
by only allowing

225
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
message dependent opening

226
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
or only allow to trace signature between

227
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,680
themselves and not specially to identify

228
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
a signer

229
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
in the case of ring signature

230
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
some authors try to restrict the

231
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,320
anonymity and try to to find to have

232
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
some accountability notion and

233
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,920
they introduce linkable or traceable

234
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,760
ring signature or even k times anonymity

235
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,720
where the idea is that if a user

236
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
sign too many times

237
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
same messages the

238
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,360
signature will become

239
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
linkable

240
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
there are distinct properties of opening

241
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,000
authorities

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,320
but there the anonymity is always

243
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
computational

244
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
so there are works where a converter so

245
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
an authority have to convert signature

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
in order to be able to

247
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
identify signer or to make link between

248
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
them

249
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
you also have a countable ring

250
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
signatures

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,560
where the purpose is to

252
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,440
have

253
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
many

254
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,519
different uh opening authorities

255
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,920
so you can have threshold

256
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
opening authority so you you need

257
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,320
that many of them

258
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
work together in order to trace

259
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
signature or you can also have a more

260
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,240
flexible scheme where

261
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
the

262
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,800
the opening authorities is chosen by the

263
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
signer but each time you still have

264
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
someone who can

265
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
can retrieve their identity or link the

266
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,079
signature so the anonymity is only

267
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,000
computational and you also have other

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
solutions that are interactive that i do

269
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
not discuss here

270
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,800
there also other flexible kind of

271
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
signatures and

272
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,399
some where

273
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
we give more control to who can sign in

274
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
who can say what

275
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
so we have attribute-based signatures

276
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,160
policy-based signatures functional

277
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,240
signatures

278
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,720
so where the purpose is not to

279
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
have a

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
statistical anonymity to live with some

281
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
kind of accountability this is more or

282
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,320
less a power to sign or not to sign

283
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
you also have some other

284
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,360
features as in dynamic group signature

285
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
in the sense that

286
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
the group of users can be chosen by the

287
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
signer at the signing time

288
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
but he can

289
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
he can only choose members of the of the

290
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
world group

291
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,839
but still this is the usual kind of

292
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,600
opening authority and anonymity

293
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
so there was one notable exception that

294
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
already mentioned so the case of

295
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,560
accountable

296
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,839
tracing signatures where ring and group

297
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,240
signature might coexist a little bit but

298
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
the user are unnotified whether they

299
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
actually live in the branch of ring

300
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
signature or of group signature

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
that means that the authority choose for

302
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
the user once and for all in which

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
branch

304
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
you will leave

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,399
and so the user doesn't know that so

306
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
this is something that

307
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,839
we want the user to be aware of

308
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
we are just indeed the first to offer

309
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
the best flexibility by pushing the

310
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
choice between group and ring signatures

311
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
at the signing time

312
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,360
so our contribution consists of

313
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
first giving a formal model of bias

314
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
and second providing generic

315
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
construction

316
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
that can be instantiated in the standard

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
model

318
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
so we provide a formal description of

319
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
the primitive the syntax

320
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,920
actually we require the use of a

321
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,079
predicate family that means that at the

322
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,920
signing time we do not have a single

323
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
predicate the signer can

324
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,440
choose one predicate among several ones

325
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,880
that are available in the public key as

326
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,079
we already mentioned we the first secret

327
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
notion that we we want are branch hiding

328
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,079
and branch sumness

329
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,639
we have unconditional anonymity or

330
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,560
statistical anonymity

331
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,040
if the predicate evaluates to one that

332
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,839
means that if it evaluates to zero the

333
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,720
signature is traceable

334
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,440
and for security purpose we also

335
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,959
have to define an extractable mode

336
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,440
an extractable mode which is

337
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,440
indistinguishable from the real mode

338
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,160
and why we need that is actually because

339
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
in order to

340
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,360
prove some kind of unaffordability

341
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
of for instance

342
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
signature that are

343
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
statistically anonymous

344
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
it is strange to define

345
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
why it is a forgery at all since we

346
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
cannot extract any identity or witness

347
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
to say oh actually it is a forgery

348
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,880
so we do not have meaningful information

349
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,240
from

350
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,800
statistical anonymous signatures so we

351
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,279
will have to flip the mode in order to

352
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
have something which allow us to always

353
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,040
extract

354
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,399
some message identity and witness

355
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,040
in order to define the security notion

356
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,959
of traceability and framability in

357
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
as usual group signature

358
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
so we also provide a generic

359
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
construction case that can be expressed

360
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,720
as bonded depth boolean circuit

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
so we can instantiate this

362
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
generic construction with signature

363
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
where the signature size is independent

364
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
of the circuit size

365
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,959
we have an instantiation based on lwe

366
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,120
that use fhe and where the depth is

367
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
polynomial

368
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
and you can also have a pairing based

369
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,639
instance

370
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,040
where the depth is only logarithmic

371
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
both instantiation are in the standard

372
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
model

373
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,759
now let me give more formal description

374
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,480
of bias

375
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
so here's the high level description so

376
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
we have a setup which defined the secret

377
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,920
key of the group manager the one of the

378
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
opening authority so o a

379
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
we have the predicate family p

380
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,920
so we have many distinct predicates p

381
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
with index i

382
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,399
and any predicates takes as input a

383
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,759
message an identity and a witness

384
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,160
and we will see what is witness this is

385
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,240
what we we call the context

386
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,440
and the predicates evaluate to zero or

387
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,399
one

388
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,279
so to join the group the group manager

389
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,240
and the

390
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
new user

391
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
engage in a protocol

392
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,559
in such a way that if the protocol

393
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,720
succeeds the

394
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,919
group manager create a certificate for

395
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,720
the user a new id

396
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
and the user also get a secret

397
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
information so that will be the signing

398
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,559
key of the user

399
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,599
to sign

400
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
a message a user with identity id a

401
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,200
certificate the secret information

402
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
the message m

403
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
witness

404
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
and predicate p produce

405
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,879
a signature sigma

406
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
to open a signature the opening

407
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
authority use its secret key

408
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,720
and we assume here that the signature is

409
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,679
valid

410
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
and to check the validity of the

411
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,080
signature we actually need the message

412
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,400
the signature and also the predicate so

413
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,360
we need

414
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
to choose a predicate to check the

415
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
validity of the signature

416
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
and the opening authority will either

417
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,200
extract an identity or a symbol

418
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
indicating that the signature is

419
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,799
actually

420
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,799
anonymous

421
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
have several potential

422
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
application for instance we can imagine

423
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
money lendering or tax evasion

424
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,760
protection in financial transaction

425
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,480
so the message m can be seen as a the

426
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,120
encryption of uh who pay uh

427
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
the the the payer and the payee

428
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,160
w is the witness and the witness can be

429
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
the amount of money

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
involved in the transaction and so this

431
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,520
witness can also be

432
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,039
in a commitment

433
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,000
which is defined outside our primitive

434
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
but they can be combined

435
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
and of course

436
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,360
anyone will not commit to a big amount

437
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,919
of money if he doesn't want to pay such

438
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,720
a

439
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
such a such amount so we can define the

440
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,960
predicate p i with index i

441
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
such that if the amount is in a range

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
and all the possible range are

443
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
set up by the public key

444
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
and we can thus have

445
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,240
statistical anonymity if the amount is

446
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,400
belongs to the to the range

447
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
or if the

448
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
transaction is actually a local

449
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,919
transaction if it is a cross-border

450
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,600
transaction then

451
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:33,780
the

452
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,039
[Music]

453
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,559
the signature should be traceable

454
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
another application is in

455
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,520
renting or buying ebook so here the

456
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,480
predicate can simply be is the book

457
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,320
contained only harmless content

458
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
so for instance if it is

459
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
a simple story we do not have

460
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
we do not need that someone is able to

461
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,440
identify who rent which book

462
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
but on the contrary if the the book

463
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,840
contains some

464
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,640
information for instance related to a

465
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
chemistry book to or we can construct a

466
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,400
bomb

467
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
it might be good to have some

468
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,320
accountability there and be able to

469
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,960
extract the identity of the actual

470
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
reader

471
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
we also have other interesting

472
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,000
application

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
on free investigative journalism

474
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
so here we have journalism who might

475
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
be abroad in some country i and

476
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
the journalists want to authenticate a

477
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,280
paper or some information

478
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
and depending on

479
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
the fact that it is in a country with a

480
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,760
freedom of speech or not

481
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
want

482
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
to have some

483
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
statistical anonymity to send

484
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,640
authenticated messages but of course if

485
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
you have in another country and you have

486
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,840
a

487
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,320
um no problem with that there is no

488
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,840
issue with being able to identify you

489
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
and even it is better to be able to

490
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,799
quickly identify who signed the papers

491
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
it will be easier for the application

492
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,840
so for the journalism abroad of course

493
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
this identity can be related to

494
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
some

495
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
credential that ensures that the

496
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
journalism receives some credential to

497
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,080
to be in another country and so on

498
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
so it's time to talk about the security

499
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
notion so we have

500
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,440
some notion of privacy and some other on

501
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,640
security

502
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,520
for privacy we have two complementary

503
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
anonymity flavors

504
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,280
so the non-traceable case and the

505
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,400
traceable case the non-traceable case

506
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
actually corresponds to the statistical

507
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,000
anonymity so the adversary can choose

508
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,799
a predicate p a single predicate p

509
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,280
a single message m but it can then

510
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
choose different distinct identities

511
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
witnesses

512
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
and certificates and as long as the

513
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,559
predicate evaluates to one in both cases

514
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,880
then the signature should statistically

515
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
hide

516
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
our choice b

517
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
in the traceability

518
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
case we can say okay now we can just

519
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
focus on what happened when the

520
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,559
predicates evaluate to zero but if we do

521
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,039
that we do not capture the branch hiding

522
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,000
notion that means that if we only have

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
an anonymity for

524
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
when pretty predictative attribute to

525
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
one and another one when the predicates

526
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
evaluate to zero that doesn't mean that

527
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,840
we have uh

528
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,440
indistinguishability uh actually

529
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,520
computationally from

530
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,799
traceable and untraceable signatures so

531
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,799
here in the trustable case actually

532
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,360
there is no restriction on the predicate

533
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
value

534
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,320
and we follow the usual cca-like

535
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,520
principle with opening carries so there

536
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,240
the anonymity is defined

537
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,039
and can only be reached computationally

538
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,600
for the security we have a two-step

539
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
notions we

540
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
talked about the the need of an

541
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,159
extractable mode in order to define for

542
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,080
instance the unforge ability of

543
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,919
statistically anonymous signature

544
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,320
so we introduce a simulation setup that

545
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,600
creates a trapdoor key information too

546
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,320
and with this piece of information we

547
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,200
can always extract identity

548
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
and weaknesses with overwhelming

549
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
probability

550
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
and actually the way we define branch

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,720
soundness is by saying that the two

552
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
modes are indistinguishable even if we

553
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,279
give to the adversary the secret signing

554
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,799
information

555
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,559
that is because

556
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,840
we do that because we want the security

557
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,919
property defined in the extractable mode

558
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,799
to have some meaningful interpretation

559
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,440
in the real mode where we want to have

560
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,159
security against the authorities if they

561
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
collude for instance

562
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
once that

563
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,120
we can extract identity and witness it

564
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,919
is easily to define now

565
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,919
the notion of trustability and and

566
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,679
frameability where

567
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,559
for instance the purpose is to show that

568
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,640
even if the opening authority and the

569
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,919
good manager collude they cannot

570
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
make an honest

571
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,880
signer

572
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
accountable for for signature that he

573
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,600
never signed

574
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
i will now give a quick overview of our

575
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
generic construction so

576
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
we have a join

577
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,360
algorithm a joint protocol which works

578
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
exactly as many other schemes

579
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
so a signer

580
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
creates a signing key skid

581
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,960
and

582
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,159
ask the group manager to sign his

583
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
public verification key

584
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,279
so the certificate is the signature

585
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
from the group manager

586
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
now to sign a message m

587
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
first we compute a message dependent

588
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
circuit

589
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
like this

590
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,679
as in

591
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
signature we also first pick a pair of

592
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,679
keys from a strongly unforgeable

593
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,320
signature scheme

594
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,120
and we will use that at the end in order

595
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
to sign all the

596
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,440
the computation that we we made in order

597
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,120
to have

598
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,039
non-malleability and we need non-male

599
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,400
ability to have a cca-like anonymity

600
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
property

601
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
we also have

602
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
to commit to the identity and the

603
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,559
witness

604
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,200
and we do that by using an llc

605
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
ciphertext an erlc encryption

606
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
so the llc encryption takes a tag which

607
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
is here the

608
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,760
the verification key of the one-time

609
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
signature scheme

610
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
and depending on the verification key we

611
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
can have a ciphertext which is lossy or

612
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
not in the real mode but we can also

613
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,520
have a mode where all the ciphertexts

614
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,679
are lossy

615
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
and we use that because we need to

616
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,320
extract at some point

617
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,919
every identity and witness and

618
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,880
we also have

619
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,679
to to switch for a program tag vk for

620
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,120
the anonymity property

621
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,159
so now we evaluate the predicate

622
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,320
actually so the circuit and we have

623
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,120
the

624
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,200
cev value

625
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,360
and we compute a lossy ciphertext so

626
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,960
this one is not our losses only lossy

627
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
and we actually

628
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
encrypt the identity or something which

629
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,360
is a zero independent of the identity

630
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,039
depending on the value of the predicate

631
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,520
then we rely on homomorphic equivocal

632
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,039
commitment so

633
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,640
this is a scheme for which it is

634
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,840
possible to compute a commitment here on

635
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
the identity and the witness

636
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,039
and anyone can evaluate on the top on

637
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,799
top of the commitment

638
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,399
some

639
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,919
some of the circuit

640
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,640
and then we will have another commitment

641
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
and us since we know the random coin we

642
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,120
are able to provide an opening value

643
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,640
for the

644
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,600
committed evaluation of the circuit on

645
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,159
the inputs that we

646
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,720
use in the commitment

647
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,559
then we of course signed a message the

648
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
predicate and also the

649
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,279
commitment

650
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,159
and we have to prove that everything was

651
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,679
done honestly and we make use of a dual

652
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,159
mode statistical and interactive zero

653
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,399
knowledge argument we proved that

654
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
everything was done honestly

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
as i just said and at the end we do not

656
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,520
have to forget to sign everything using

657
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,320
the one-time secret key of the strongly

658
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,760
unaffordable scheme

659
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,600
it is worth noticing that we do not

660
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,480
really

661
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,200
directly need a simulation soundness

662
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,559
from the

663
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,919
uh

664
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
the argument because we actually rely on

665
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,120
the lossy

666
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,919
the lossiness of the ciphertext so it is

667
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
possible to have simply honest

668
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,600
computation

669
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,440
and everything was done by the

670
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,159
indistinguishable

671
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,760
modes of the

672
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,520
lossy encryption key

673
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,679
to conclude we introduce bifurcated

674
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,320
anonymous signature and new direction of

675
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,240
bifurcated cryptography in general

676
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
we reconcile unconditional anonymity and

677
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
accountability in a single scheme at the

678
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
signing time

679
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,840
we provide generic construction in the

standard model for bond and depth

we have two instantiation and in the

case of pairings

684
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,000
we can use a gross high proof system

685
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,480
structure preserving signature and just

686
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,720
to give an id here you have the size of

687
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
the of the signature which depends on

688
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,320

so we use symmetric pairing is just to

692
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,799
to to show

693
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,120
how practical in some sense the

694
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
signature

695
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,919
size can be

696
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,520
we have some nice open problem of course

697
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
we can try to apply the bifurcated id to

698
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
other primitives

699
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
for instance

700
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,760
to end to end encryption with escrow or

701
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,520
not

702
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
we can also try to have more practical

703
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,799
bias

704
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,600
for specific predicates in the random

705
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
oracle model and under simple

706
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,799
assumptions

707
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,799
and of course you can also imagine

708
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,440
extension of malicious key and subverted

709
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
anonymity that we

710
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,679
already defined in the

711
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,360
long version of the paper and we can

712
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,799
also think about

713
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,399
revoking

714
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,880
revoking

715
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,080
the ability to sign in the group

716
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,240
thank you i hope you enjoyed your

717
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,240
presentation
