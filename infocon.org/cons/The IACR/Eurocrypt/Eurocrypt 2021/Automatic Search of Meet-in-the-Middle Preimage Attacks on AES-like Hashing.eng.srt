00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,080
hello everyone i am dantesh from

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
institute of information engineering

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
chinese academy of sciences

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,880
it is a pleasure to give a talk about

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
automatic research of meeting the middle

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
pre-image attacks on ais like hashi

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,920
this is a joint work with shenzhen at

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
our

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
firstly let's start with an introduction

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,079
of the research background

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,520
in this paper we many focus on hash

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,200
functions filter on the block cipher as

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
like

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,360
these harsh functions are usually

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
constructed based on compression

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
functions

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,039
the pathway messages are partitioned

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,840
into several

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,559
blocks then integrate the compression

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,319
function over all message blocks

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,479
after processing the last message block

22
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,720
automotive the message digest

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,280
the compression function can be

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
constructed from block ciphers

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
linear and or summarize the several pg e

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
modes to converge a block cipher to a

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
comprehensive function

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
these are the modes commonly used in

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
practice

30
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,360
with the underlying for local cipher

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
aes lab

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
records the hash functions as af like

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
hashing

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,040
the aes like run function typically

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
consists of four operations

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,240
the stage is organized into a

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,600
two-dimensional array of cells

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,200
the substance is to apply a non-linear

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,959
substitution box operation to each cell

40
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
the shift rows is to compute the share

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
positions according to our communication

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
the mix columns is to update each column

43
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,720
by

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,280
multiplication of a maximal distance

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
separable modulus

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
the anyone looking between two xor

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
vertically into the stage

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,160
image resistance refers to the property

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
that for a given package

50
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,879
it's

51
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,040
computationally difficult to find a

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,720
message satisfying this equation

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,319
here h0 is a fixed

54
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,319
initialization value

55
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,080
usually we will find a pseudo free image

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
of a compression function

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,159
convert the pseudo-pre-image

58
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,400
to pre-image in a general way

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
this is done by first finding several

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
pseudo-pre images

61
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,319
and then starting from the rear

62
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,519
initialization value

63
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
using several random

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
message blocks to get several chaining

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
values

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
among these changing values

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
we can expect to find out

68
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,720
of that

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
the core is a meeting in the middle soto

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
pre-image attacker on its compression

71
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,879
function

72
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,080
in inserted in the middle attacker

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
the computation can be divided into two

74
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,360
trunks

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
the computation chamfer in this

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,480
direction is named as a forward chunk

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,920
and the other is a backward chunk

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
and they will match

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
at our immediate round

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,799
note that

81
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
each chunk includes at least one message

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,399
word that is independent of the other

83
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,680
trump

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
where this message was according neutral

85
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,440
stairs

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,400
in this figure denoted the neutral

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,360
fields for the forward transfer and the

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
backward chunk of 5 blue ma and the red

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,840
and b respectively

90
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,280
then the attack procedure is first to

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,880
assign arbitrary compatible values

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,479
to all bytes

93
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,000
except those that depend on the neutral

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
shares

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,479
for all forward neutral shares

96
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,000
for the computer to get the quantitative

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,440
values of the matching state

98
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,039
and for all backward neutral shares back

99
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
over the computer to get the candidate

100
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
values of the matching state

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,479
sorting the two lists

102
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,400
check for a fourth state match

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,639
additional match technique is applied

104
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,600
usually check out whether there is a

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,120
partition match on several feet

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
for the surviving tears

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
check for a first step match

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,440
repeat the horse procedure several times

109
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,639
by changing the values of fixed

110
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
message words

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,639
we can expect to find a first date match

112
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,600
so the attacker

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,800
complexity is assuming this equation

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
and in order to obtain a better attack

115
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
the minimum of the size

116
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
of the neutral

117
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,639
bites and the melting pads should have

118
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,440
been

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
maximized

120
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
supplies and the culture

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
and initial structure techniques are

122
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
developed

123
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,479
because the dm model as an example

124
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
computer across the first and the last

125
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
round is valid

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
since there's a supplies in the card

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,039
technical

128
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
the starting point can be at an

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
intermediate stage

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
initial structure enables one to skip

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,919
several rounds at the starting point

132
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,039
check the aes mix column as an example

133
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,479
the three red cells are choosing as

134
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,160
neutral bytes for the backward chunk

135
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
so there are two to the power of

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
24 possible values

137
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,319
the three parts are only in the forward

138
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
computation

139
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,560
thus each output byte will be unknown

140
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
because the orbits depend on these three

141
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
rate of cells

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
but if we impose the restriction of the

143
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,319
equation one

144
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
now does deliberate cells did the two

145
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
constants in character on two cells

146
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,560
now more bytes can be completed in the

147
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,400
forward chamber

148
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,560
under this condition

149
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,520
there would be due to the power of eight

150
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,080
possible solutions for the three

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
greatest years

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,599
the initial structure technique is used

153
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,879
to cancel the impact of the neutral

154
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,160
cells on the opposite tongue

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,800
by consuming the freedom

156
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
base of the neutral spikes

157
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,680
in our model we will extend the initial

158
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,240
structure technique to every possible

159
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
one

160
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
next i'd like to give message of

161
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,599
programming the attack with next integer

162
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,840
linear program

163
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,280
the complexity of the attack many

164
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,039
depends on three configurations

165
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,880
first one is the chunk of separation

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,679
the starting point and the matching

167
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,559
point

168
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
should be determined

169
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,040
we will build an independent model for

170
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,760
each chunk separation

171
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
that means for each individual model

172
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
the starting and the matching points are

173
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
fixed

174
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,839
and all possible chunk separations will

175
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
be tried

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
as i said earlier

177
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,800
our starting point is a state

178
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
we will extend the initial structure

179
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,080
technique to every possible round

180
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
by adding constraints to the mutual

181
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
shares and the consuming degrees control

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
the impact on the opposite chunk the

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
second one is the neutral shells

184
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,279
the selection and the constraints of the

185
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,920
neutral shears we are determining the

186
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
freedom degrees for each chunk

187
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
the third one is the sales for matching

188
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
and this also depends on the selection

189
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
of the neutral spheres

190
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
we will encode the attribute of each

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
cell with 001

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
variables

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
and converted the computation rules to

194
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,000
several constraints over these variables

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,160
firstly the attributes of state shares

196
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
should be encoded according to whether

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,399
they are determined by the future bits

198
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,000
from one or two directions or none

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,360
then the four attributes can be encoded

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
by two zero one variables

201
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
the grayscale is encoded by one one

202
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,680
which are constant bytes and knowing in

203
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
both trunks

204
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,440
the volusia is encoded by 1 0

205
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
which are determined by forward neutral

206
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
bytes and the constants

207
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
and the knowing in the forward chunk

208
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
the red cell is equated by zero one

209
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160
which are determined by backward neutral

210
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
bytes and the constants

211
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,399
and the annoying in the backward trunk

212
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,640
the white cell is encoded by zero zero

213
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,079
which are determined by both forward and

214
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,640
backward neutral bytes

215
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
and the unknowing in both chunks

216
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
in the encoding scheme

217
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,279
the blue and the gray cells are known in

218
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
the forward trunk

219
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,079
while red and the glaciers are known in

220
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,000
the backward chunk one cell is annoying

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
in the forward trunk if only if

222
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
variable x equals one

223
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
where the cell is annoying in the

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
backward chunker before only for

225
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,600
variable y equals one

226
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
under this encoding scheme

227
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
the number of blue shares and the

228
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
radicals in the starting point

229
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,000
can be computed easily in several ways

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,360
which are the initial freedom degrees of

231
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
two chunks

232
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
here i give an example

233
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
we can introduce an indicator variable

234
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
beta for each cell

235
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
let the beta equals one if and only if

236
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,800
the cell is a gray

237
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,079
this euro will restrict the three

238
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,440
variables to a subset of

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,040
f2 to the power of 3.

240
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
the subset can be described by a system

241
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,839
of linear inequalities

242
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,560
by using the convex the whole

243
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,959
computation method

244
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,880
x equals one if and only for the cell is

245
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,639
a gray or blue

246
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
and the y equals one if and only for the

247
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
zero is gray or orbit

248
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,079
thus the initial freedom degrees can be

249
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,719
computed in these two equations

250
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
then we should add constraints over

251
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,120
these variables according to the basic

252
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,200
rules of attribute propagation

253
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,440
rules of two directions are different

254
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
since the meanings of radar and the

255
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
pollutions are dual for the forward and

256
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,320
backward computations

257
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,279
in the following i only describe

258
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,160
attribute propagation rules in the

259
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,839
backward trunker

260
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,560
computation as our model is based on

261
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,160
sales

262
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
the substance do not change the age

263
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
future and the shift rules will commute

264
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
to the attributes according to the

265
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
permutation

266
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,720
the x or operation can consume opposite

267
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,920
of freedom degrees to reduce the impacts

268
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,120
thus a new variable sigma should be

269
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
introduced for each xor operation to

270
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
counter the consume the degrees

271
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
this figure shows the xor rule for

272
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,760
propagation through the xor operation is

273
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,120
a backward computation

274
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,560
and the opposite of blue freedom degrees

275
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,959
can be consumed

276
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
for example

277
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,839
the two blue spikes are unknown in the

278
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,399
backwater computation

279
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
if one blue freedom degree is consumed

280
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,800
the two blue bytes can lead to constant

281
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,600
impact on the output cell this rule will

282
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,160
restrict these variables to a subset of

283
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
f2 to the power of 7

284
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,120
which can be described by a system of

285
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
linear inequalities

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
by using the convex support computation

287
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
method

288
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,240
according to whether there are white or

289
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
red or blue cells

290
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
the ruler of corporation through the

291
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,720
fixed column matrix can be divided into

292
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
five cases

293
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,519
if there is at least

294
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,600
one white cell in the input column

295
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
all the output cells are unknown and

296
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
white

297
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,079
if all the input shares are gray

298
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,680
they all output the sales agree in case

299
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,279
2 assume there are blue cells but no

300
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,480
white cells and no red cells in the

301
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
input column

302
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,560
if we do not add any restrictions

303
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,880
or ought all output cells should be blue

304
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,920
but

305
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,199
add new constraints by consuming the

306
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,759
blue freedom decrease

307
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,759
will lead to constant impact on several

308
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,279
bytes

309
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
then each output there would be blue or

310
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,800
gray

311
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,160
moreover

312
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
the consumed degrees

313
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
should be less than the number of blue

314
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,639
shares in the input column

315
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,600
and this condition should be fulfilled

316
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
in case 4

317
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
the latest cells can be obtained

318
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,480
through consuming blue degrees to cancel

319
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
the impact on red cells

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,279
otherwise

321
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,800
the bite is white and unknown because it

322
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
is determined by blue and the red cells

323
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
can 5 is

324
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,079
obvious

325
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,320
in order to distinguish the five cases

326
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,279
we would introduce three indicator

327
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
variables

328
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,720
letter mu equals 1 before and only if

329
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,359
there are white bytes

330
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,799
this will restrict the variables to a

331
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,520
subset of f 2 to the power of 9

332
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,439
and the constraints can be generated by

333
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,079
using the convex form computation method

334
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,720
in a similar way bx is used to determine

335
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,840
whether there are radar

336
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,520
cells when there are no white cells

337
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,720
if x equals 0 the byte is red

338
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
according to the values of x variables

339
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,799
in the imported column

340
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
we can determine whether there are red

341
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
cells

342
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
define vx equals one

343
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,960
equal and only equal

344
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
each x equals one

345
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,880
and there are no radicals

346
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,160
if vx equals one

347
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,000
omega y is used to determine whether

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,480
there are volusias

349
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
and the definition are similar to that

350
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
of vx

351
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,880
now with the hair part of the three

352
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
indicator variables

353
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,679
we can convert the five cases into

354
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
constraints by a conditional modeling

355
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,720
approach the first two constraints are

356
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
obvious

357
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,400
when mu equals 1 case 1 can be described

358
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
by equation 2

359
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
and other cases naturally satisfy

360
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,520
equation 2 when mu equals 0

361
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
according to the observation when mu

362
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,320
equals 0

363
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,760
each x in the output column equals v x

364
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,440
thus the constraint of equations three

365
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
are generated

366
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,840
other cases naturally satisfy this

367
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
equation

368
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,600
now we only need to give the necessary

369
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,400
constants over these output y variables

370
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,520
in case 3 and the case 5

371
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,640
if omega y equals 1

372
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,960
each y in the output column equals 1

373
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,840
thus

374
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,880
the final constraint of the last

375
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,520
equation is generated

376
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,640
in case 2 and the case 4

377
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
when omega y equals 0

378
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
y may equal 1 because the blue

379
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
freedom degrees are consumed

380
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
and the number of blue cells in the

381
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,160
input column should be larger than the

382
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,160
number of the output known bytes

383
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
this is achieved by this constraint

384
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,120
the second term is the number of the

385
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,559
pollutions in the import column

386
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
the third term is the number of knowing

387
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
bytes in the output column

388
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
and in order to make sure other cases

389
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
naturally satisfy this constraint

390
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
the first term is added now these

391
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,080
constraints can describe the propagation

392
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,960
cervix column

393
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,520
at the case 2 and 4. freedom degrees

394
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,280
will be consumed to cancel the impact on

395
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,400
radar or glaciers

396
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,919
if blue degrees can be consumed

397
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
the consumed degrees are number of

398
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,679
knowing output bytes

399
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,799
and it can be described by this

400
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,240
constraint

401
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
where data is a indicator variable such

402
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,120
that

403
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
the era equals zero

404
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,240
if blue degrees can be consumed

405
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,760
now we have considered all operations

406
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
one may attempt to apply

407
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,679
xor rule and the fixed column rule

408
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,000
separately

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
this approach is valid but misses

410
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
important

411
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
provocation schemes

412
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,000
that may lead to better attacks

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
for example considering the input

414
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,240
columns shown in this figure

415
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,159
applying the xor rule results in white

416
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,440
cells

417
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,280
after the xor operation

418
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
subsequently

419
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
apply the mixed column rule we will end

420
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,720
up with a four column of white cells

421
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,840
however

422
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
if we model the x or and the mixed

423
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,320
column operations as a whole

424
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,919
as shown in this equation and we can

425
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,840
still restrict the values of blue cells

426
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,559
to cancel the impact on some great cells

427
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,760
then some red cells will be preserved

428
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,280
thus we model the x or and the biggest

429
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,320
column operations as a whole in the

430
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
backward trunk

431
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
and the x or mixed column ruler

432
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,039
and the

433
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,159
mixed column rule are similar the main

434
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,280
difference is to compute the

435
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,080
input blue degrees

436
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
so i will only explain the

437
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,840
first equation as i said earlier

438
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,760
either the status

439
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,919
or the key is blue a blue freedom degree

440
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,480
can be provided

441
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,360
thus we will introduce four variable toy

442
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,880
toi equals one if either the state or

443
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
the key is blue

444
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,480
then the sum of torah is the important

445
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,880
blue freedom decrease

446
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,039
thus this constraint is obtained

447
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,400
note that

448
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
in order to make sure that other cases

449
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,480
naturally satisfy this

450
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,440
constraint the first two terms are added

451
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,080
finally in order to find a valid attack

452
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,520
there should be at least one byte can be

453
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,679
used to match

454
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,200
note that

455
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,480
apart from direct matching values

456
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
of common words

457
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,679
any determine the relations between

458
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
words in the states

459
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,520
at the matching point can be exploited

460
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
and filled out

461
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,320
mismatch the computations

462
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,880
for aes mix column

463
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
if the number of the known bytes in both

464
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,360
trunks are larger than 5

465
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,480
the matching can be performed

466
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,760
to minimize the time complexity of the

467
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
attack

468
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,440
the minimum of the size of neutral bites

469
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,679
and the melting bites should be

470
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,279
maximized

471
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,640
equipped with the presented tool

472
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
we evaluated the security of hashi

473
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,919
functions virtual on aes live cyphers

474
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,120
for all targets improved attacks are

475
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
identified

476
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,320
in particular our tour found the first

477
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,360
image attacks on it around the as128

478
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
hashimoto's

479
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,439
thanks for your attention
