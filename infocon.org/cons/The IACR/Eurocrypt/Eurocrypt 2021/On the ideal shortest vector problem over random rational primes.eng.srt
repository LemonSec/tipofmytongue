00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,359
welcome to eurocrypt 2021

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,879
so in this talk

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,800
i will present the paper

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
on the ideal shortest vector problem

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,160
over random

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,759
rational primes

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,520
and this is a joint work with dr pen dr

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,960
shu and dr

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,439
wedley

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,720
so

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,439
this research is closely related to the

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
lattice-based cryptography

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
so this

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
lattice-based cryptogram is very popular

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,239
recently

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,320
because it has several very light

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
properties for example it is quantum

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
resistant

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,360
and

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,399
also it allows fast operation

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,280
in

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
light space cryptography

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,559
the operation is usually just addition

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
and multiplicity or small numbers

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,079
and no exponentiation

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,600
and then you also have uh

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
worst case hardlys

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,720
so this is

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
very very interesting

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,159
but it has

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,640
it does have a problem since no

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
dimensional lattice property is usually

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,600
easy

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
so this need

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
some pieces problem

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,280
that is why

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,799
we want to use

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
ideal lattice so using ideal let's

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,119
hopefully can solve this

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,280
key size problem

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,200
so what is lattice

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
lattice is um

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,920
giving a

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
linearly independent vector in the real

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,680
space

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
and lattice is basically an integral

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,600
linear combination

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
of

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,360
those

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,399
linearly independent vectors

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,600
so

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,720
this

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,920
this this

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
this vector is form a basis for for this

55
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
lattice so we can see

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,719
a simple picture here we have um

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,320
r2

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
my ukulele plane we have two vector

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
and

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,840
the

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
integral linear combination

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,880
would be

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
give you all those points so then so

64
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
lattices discrete points periodic

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,440
discrete points

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
and

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
there could be other bases going to be

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
generated same lattice will be generally

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
the same lattice but this

70
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
this new base

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,040
is considered better because they are

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
shorter especially the red one

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
the red one is the shortest vector in

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,920
the lattice

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
funding

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,959
this spvp would be

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
most important computational problem

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
in native theory

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
and then and then here

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
we have this

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
this fundamental domain

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
this fundamental domain

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
is fundamental domain and the volume of

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,959
this fundamentally is the determinant of

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,720
this lattice determining all this

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
lattice so the determinant

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,730
is

88
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,920
[Music]

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
murder the size of the lattice matter

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,640
the size of the lattice

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,319
so

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,840
for the

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720
short

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
vector

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,319
we know a little bit about the lens

96
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,879
below some upper bound

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,519
so for example there is a hermit mound

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
then there's going to be

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,360
the euclideans

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,959
going to be less than square root of n

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
times determinant lattice over one over

102
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,319
n and this is a uniform bond

103
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,120
and then there's a ghost heuristic

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,640
which basically says on average you

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,440
should have length

106
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
square root over

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
2e pi

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
and then determine l

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
over n

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560
but this bond is a sympathetic bond

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
and then

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,439
there is i mean cosi bond says that must

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,040
have length less than

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
square root of 2 and over e pi are

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
determining

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,839
to the institute of the determinant

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,198
then through the determinant

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,759
and then the svp is shortest vector

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
problem of persimmon svp and hermita svp

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
basically are three close lead problem

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
the undefined vector of length

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
lesson number one lambda y is the length

123
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,919
of the shortest vector

124
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,040
uh that will be svp problem

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,759
uh approximation you can approximate

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,479
this

127
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
this problem is is hard so

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,479
so maybe in some cases you want

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
approximation organ

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,520
so

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
uh

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
the approximation factor will be gamma

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
and then hermit suv problem

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,720
is

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
the problem we're going to

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,039
study in this paper

137
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,199
and basically we try to find

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,840
a vector of less less gamma time

139
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,199
determinant as root of the determinant

140
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,280
so these can see if gamma is greater

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
than square root of n

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
then

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,680
there exists such a vector

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
so

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,280
the idea

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
lattice

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
basically comes from the number field

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,840
and number ring so a number field over

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
rational number is basically

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
uh

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
you have a qx

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
mod out you reduce what polynomial

153
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
degree and

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
when you reduce my volume degree and

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,039
that and then the ring of integer in

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
this field

157
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
is actually a freezy module so

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
if you see a freezing module then

159
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
you you you can you can see that there's

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
a connection

161
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
to the lattice

162
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,440
so some sometimes this ring of interest

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
particularly lies

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,720
this is called monogenic

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
basically means that there exists alpha

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
such that

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
the real integer

168
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,000
is essentially

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
a linear combination of this power base

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
so you have a power base

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
which generates

172
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,479
uh

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
no integers so in

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
in many cases in cryptography we like

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,479
like we like this kind of rim because

176
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,240
it's easy to do the computation

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
so

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
here we have a number field and a number

179
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,840
ring and we want to

180
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,039
uh make a lattice out of it

181
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
so a sample field have exactly any

182
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,240
embodied into complex number

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
so we cross sigma one sigma two up to

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
sigma n

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880
and the colonic embedding

186
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,479
you see we basically

187
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,319
send this number field to cn to cn and

188
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,039
and which essentially just missed all

189
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,479
its

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,360
complex embeddings so we have sigma a

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,319
sigma two a and sigma n a and the e

192
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
image which is just a subspace of c n

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,440
and it is also isomorphic to iron as an

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
inner product space

195
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
for example

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,680
if you have a qx mod out x to the

197
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
first power plus one then for y you're

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
going to send to one one one one

199
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
four complex number or

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,160
if you really prefer a real number then

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
that will be square root to zero square

202
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,280
root of zero

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,599
and for one plus x

204
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,720
you send to one plus

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
z eight one plus z eight

206
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,160
to the seven and one plus z eight to the

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
third and one positive eight to the

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
fifth and you can see that

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,039
this and this are conjugates with each

210
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,879
the other and this and these are

211
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
conjugated

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
a complex conjugate

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
which is our and

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
zeta eight is just

215
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,479
e to the

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,080
2 pi i

217
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
over 8

218
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
over 8.

219
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,280
so but then if you insist real number

220
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,599
then then then you just

221
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,520
just write the real part imaginary part

222
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,319
but

223
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
you need to put a square root of two

224
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,799
factor over there to make sure that

225
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,200
they are isomorphic as the inner product

226
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,519
space

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,479
so there is

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
also a coefficient embedding

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,399
here

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,519
that um

231
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
suppose suppose the ring of integer is

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
monogenic then you just send to the

233
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,200
coefficient

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,519
so for example again

235
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,360
if for the qx mod x to the first power

236
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
plus one

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,440
and then and we know this is

238
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
um can be generated

239
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
probably is just one x x square

240
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
x cubed so for y you just said 1 0 0 0

241
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
and if it is 1 plus 2 x just

242
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,399
send 1 to 0 0 and that's

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,839
go directly into

244
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,120
integers so this is

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
this is probably if you design group

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
system that's

247
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
the in building you are going to use

248
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
so the idea lattice

249
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
there are

250
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
so first we can have a principle idea is

251
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
basically generated by single elements

252
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,399
like gx

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,800
so it's corresponding

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
to to this lattice

255
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
so here that you model x

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,839
plus

257
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,959
one hence that

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,880
that other vector basically are anti

259
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
cyclic so you

260
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
you you doing this

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,120
cyclical rotation but

262
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
you change the sign with the first

263
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,360
elements

264
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
and a general idea

265
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
can be generated by

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,399
as a

267
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,320
okay module can be generated by two

268
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
elements one is the integer another one

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
is gx

270
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,800
so that means that in addition to this

271
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
anti-significant matrix

272
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
you need

273
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,719
you need

274
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,079
so those prime ideas

275
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
they are considered as a point

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,200
because they are also maximum ideas they

277
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
are considered points so you put them

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,959
those points together

279
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,959
to

280
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,760
and i hear that

281
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,720
that z again is just a straight line

282
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
the point is basically

283
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
a rational price

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
and then there are primes

285
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
lie over those rational primes

286
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,519
so for example

287
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
here that uh we have a rational prime p

288
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
and then there are two points there are

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
two points but you can see that

290
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
this is this is like a tangent so so

291
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
basically you have a p one square and p

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
two squared

293
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,079
and in this case we call p is uh uh

294
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,079
ramified the prime magnified prime and

295
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
there are only five and many prime which

296
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
will be very unified so we don't we

297
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,040
don't consider

298
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
we don't we don't need to worry too much

299
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
about

300
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
those prime ideas

301
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,360
and then there are

302
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
rational prime going to

303
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,600
split completely into

304
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
into four

305
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,000
different in this case four because the

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
excision degree is four so these

307
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,279
four distinct prime ideas

308
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
so those those again

309
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,279
this is the case

310
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
and we we think would be the most

311
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,680
difficult case

312
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
and here are that

313
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,399
you have two prime ideas 9 over p

314
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,200
so

315
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
so those prime ideas they each have

316
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
actually have degree 2

317
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,680
so they are so that's why i use a large

318
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
dot to represent them

319
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
and those prime ideas

320
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,639
are actually

321
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,120
not difficult use prime ideas the svp

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,079
problems for them a lot difficult

323
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
not difficult

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
well this is not as difficult as those

325
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,279
small dots

326
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
so the reason that

327
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,519
the reason

328
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
is because this decomposition field so

329
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,560
so basically we actually can have a very

330
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
interesting sub field

331
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,160
here

332
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,959
so

333
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,839
so here let's give you the our group of

334
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,440
l over q

335
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
the decomposition group d

336
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
is basically the elements in the galway

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
field the galway group which fix this

338
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,800
prime ideal

339
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,399
satellites

340
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,079
and the k is a decomposition field is

341
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,279
essentially

342
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
the sub field correspond to that group

343
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,440
and

344
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
they have uh

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,800
those those those group and field have

346
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
have

347
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
these two property if p is unramified

348
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,639
then this is isomorphic

349
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
to the galois group

350
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,800
of o l over p one

351
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,839
the overl over py is an extension of the

352
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,680
valid field

353
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,399
so

354
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,560
so this color group is essentially going

355
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,240
to generate by single elements the

356
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,040
phrabinis the forbiddens so that d is

357
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,279
going to be a signal group

358
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,079
and

359
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,199
and if the prime idea is generated

360
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,639
as the ol module by p and the polynomial

361
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
degree over t

362
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
then the degree of k which is the

363
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
decomposition field with p1

364
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
is actually just t

365
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
and then

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
i know more interestingly that the py

367
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,040
intersection with k this actually gives

368
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
you a sub lattice and that sub lasts

369
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
have a

370
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
determinant which is basically p

371
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,839
which is basically p so

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,199
so so this is this is this this that's

373
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,959
the reason that if d is non-trivial then

374
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,959
then the difficulty of svp is get get

375
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,279
decreasing if you can move

376
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,399
move to this smaller field

377
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,320
so this this picture going to make

378
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
things

379
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
even more clear so here

380
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,480
you have a prime idea which you want to

381
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,920
find a

382
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,000
shortest vector

383
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,040
and

384
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
and because

385
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
suppose there is a non-trivial

386
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,399
non-trivial

387
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
decomposition group then then this this

388
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,880
field would be

389
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,839
a sub-field of l along trivial sub-field

390
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,360
of l

391
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
so hence you have this c would be a

392
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
lattice

393
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,959
would be a lattice in this smaller field

394
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
so it has a smaller dimension that

395
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,279
imagines just g

396
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,199
and and it's

397
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,760
it's the determinant is just p

398
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
so so the shortest vector

399
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
in c which again will be a very short in

400
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
p

401
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,759
which will be very short in p so so this

402
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
is you can think this is again a

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
sufficient attack that

404
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,279
it's just you are using this

405
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,199
decomposition field decomposition here

406
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959
you can move the infield

407
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,600
and then and then the map between the cg

408
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,860
and cn is

409
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,680
[Music]

410
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
this beta

411
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,079
it's

412
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,720
very simple very small just repeat the

413
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
coordinates

414
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
if if you're using the colonic in body

415
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
so the main theorem this is our main

416
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
theorem the mean term

417
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,199
suppose our q is phi let's galloway

418
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,759
extension with degree n and suppose p is

419
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
a prime idea

420
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
lie over unravel the rational prime

421
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
and if k is a decomposition field the

422
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
solution to this hermit svp with factor

423
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
gamma in sub lattice and the colonic

424
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,399
embedding

425
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,399
will also be a solution

426
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
of the hermit svp in p

427
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,759
with a factor

428
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,720
um

429
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,440
which is not very far away from gamma

430
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,759
under a cloning embedded so so basically

431
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,800
that

432
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,480
this doesn't tell you to find svp

433
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
you can simply just find let's be in a

434
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,000
you know smaller the decomposition field

435
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,399
as known as this decomposition group is

436
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,040
not trivial

437
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,480
okay and then

438
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,199
here that you have this in this theorem

439
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,439
you have this complicated

440
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,640
complicated factor but for power of two

441
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
sig atomic field

442
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
which has been quite popular in

443
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,439
cryptography

444
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
uh uh

445
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
the the scene

446
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,039
the situation is actually simpler

447
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,559
simpler that

448
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
that you can you can simply

449
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,240
uh

450
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,679
depend on the prime whether it's

451
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
congruent to one or three

452
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,799
you can calculate the number r

453
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,600
and

454
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
so

455
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
the dimension of the lattice

456
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
at the real dimension

457
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
would be just two to the other rather

458
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,679
than two and since

459
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,919
in those cases is

460
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,320
much bigger than rr so

461
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
so that's that's going to make make this

462
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,880
prime idea sleepy problem much easier

463
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
so especially

464
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
especially if

465
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
p is congruent to

466
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,720
plus minus three mark eight

467
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,919
in this

468
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,600
case that you

469
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,240
uh the real dimension is actually just

470
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,650
um

471
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,760
[Music]

472
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,720
it's just two so you just need to solve

473
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,600
svp for the dimension two and and we

474
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
know for the mean two

475
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
uh you can just simply use gauss

476
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,480
reduction

477
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,559
so so this species showed that

478
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,799
for the prime idea lie over

479
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,400
uh rational prime which is congruent to

480
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
plus minus three mod eight

481
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
uh those prime idea

482
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
svp is very easy it's very easy

483
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,679
and we have this kind of hierarchies

484
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,480
that if the prime is

485
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
plus minus three mile eight then the

486
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,720
domain is just two and if it's plus

487
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
minus seven or sixteen

488
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,960
you just need to solve a spvp problem

489
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
for dimension

490
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,480
four

491
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
and i use this

492
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,200
uh plus minus 15 or 32

493
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
but the real demand is just eight

494
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,160
so it's not going to be capital n could

495
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,559
continue to be very large

496
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,840
but just

497
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,200
eight so

498
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
so this so basically says that

499
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,240
for half of the prime

500
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
half of the rational prime the prime

501
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,960
idea

502
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
lie over those rational prime will be

503
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,880
extremely easy

504
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,840
and then

505
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
uh just to making two

506
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,000
so so you can see that there is a

507
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
hierarchy of difficulty and

508
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
the difficulty actually changes pretty

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
big

510
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
so it still

511
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,520
is actually the double the dimension

512
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
every time you

513
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,440
you you go

514
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
you cut the dimension every time you you

515
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,400
move out

516
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,799
of this hierarchy

517
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
so then what is what is the average case

518
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,960
complexity or prime idea lattice svp

519
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,919
well it's going to depend on how you how

520
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,000
you select your prime ideas

521
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,679
so if

522
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,880
that you first try a random rational

523
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
prime and then find your prime idea not

524
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,919
over this rational prime

525
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
then your prime

526
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
svg problem is is

527
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
easy to every case compact is easy

528
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,159
and

529
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
so similarly that if you just

530
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,159
if you just

531
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,320
uh again again

532
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,439
choose prime idea

533
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
according to the rational prime uh

534
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
downstairs

535
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,240
then then it's easy but but again if you

536
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
choose your primary according to

537
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,600
according to its determinant or norm

538
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,440
well in that case

539
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,000
our our work will not apply will not

540
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,960
apply

541
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,360
so so the average case

542
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,639
will be still open problem

543
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
so again

544
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
for the composite idea so those idea

545
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
well not

546
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
prime ideas we also have have results

547
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,039
again it's depend on

548
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,240
the prime

549
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,080
and the downstairs the rational prime

550
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
downstairs basically

551
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,880
the take-home message for this paper is

552
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,679
that the prime

553
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,320
downstairs actually determine the

554
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,039
difficulty of the prime idea upstairs

555
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,840
upstairs okay

556
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,159
so open problem which we find very

557
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
interesting would be

558
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,280
that um

559
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,440
uh to determine the length of the to

560
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,039
determine the exact length of the

561
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,400
shortest vector

562
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,640
lie over rational prime which

563
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
a lot congruent to plus minus three

564
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,120
for for the plus minus three mod eight

565
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,720
we have determined exact names

566
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
of the svp or the shortest vector

567
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,959
and then again of course
