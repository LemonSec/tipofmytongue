1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,600
hey everyone

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,000
my name is safros marin and i'm going to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,839
present a joint work with my advisor

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,200
nathan keller

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
mind the middle layer the headless

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,240
design strategy revisited

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,640
before we dive into the details

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,039
i'll start with a short summary

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,720
as you could probably guess by the name

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,400
our results concern the middle layer of

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
the halo's design which is a combination

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,599
of spn rounds and partial espionage

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
which we call the middle layer as you

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,199
see in the figure

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,640
it's okay if we don't fully understand

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
for now we'll get back to that later

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,800
specifically we consider the

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
instantiations of the aegis design which

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
are poseidon and stalking

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440
for poseidon we show how an analysis of

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
the middle layer can be used to increase

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
the security guarantee and gain

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,559
statistical attacks

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,559
as you can see in the figure for some of

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,399
the poseidon variants the middle layer

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,000
provides even better security against

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,239
physical attacks through the foregrounds

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,480
for example for the t equals six

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
variants

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
the full bronze insure only twenty eight

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
active as luke says while the middle

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
layer and show thirty two

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
again it's okay if we don't understand

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
what it means for now we will get back

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
to it with more detail

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
these results mean that the same level

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
of security against this type of attacks

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
can be achieved while using less full

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
rounds which can result in a significant

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,960
build-up of the cipher

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
in starcad however it was not the case

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
we show that for some of the circuit

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
variants there exists a huge invariant

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
subspace which doesn't activate any xbox

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,680
in the partial runs

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,520
what to mean by invariant here is that

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
linear transformation used in starcad

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,040
map is subspace with cell

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,479
what it means is that for every

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
difference delta from our invariant

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,680
subset v and every two inputs x and y

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
with this difference

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
the difference of the output is

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
determined completely by delta

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
notice that the difference is stored

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
here as a work of a binary field

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
this is obviously an undesirable

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,479
property of the cipher

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,239
as we'll see later in the presentation

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
we get this result by analysis of kosher

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,920
materials which are the family of

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
matrices of the authors of sarcasm that

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
chose to use

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
in a paper by benetal which appeared in

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,680
crypt 2020 the authors show how to

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
attack starcad assuming the circuit

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
matrix satisfy some conditions

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
we show that these conditions fall for

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
some of the variants which break the

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,360
security guarantee of the cipher for

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,239
some of the parameters

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,480
now let's get into the details

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
before explaining the rationale of the

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
headed design let's go over spn and

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
partial spin designs

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,160
spn which stands for substitution

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
permutation network is a very wide use

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
construction used in aes for example in

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
which every encryption round consists of

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
key addition linear operation and

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,840
non-linear operation called s-boxes and

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,280
applies to each block of the cipher

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,319
separately

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,920
partial spm

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
is a newer design in which only some of

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
the states go to an s-box in each round

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
in the header design the first and last

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,640
round are full spn rounds while the

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
middle layer consists of partial spn

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,720
runs

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
the idea behind the helix design is to

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
use the full rounds to ensure security

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
against statistical attacks

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
there are known methods to do this as

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
was done in aes

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,599
and use the middle partial rounds to

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,040
ensure security against him to break

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
attacks as even a partial one with one s

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
box as indicated in half's design has

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
the same algebraic degree that of the

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,720
foreground

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,799
this design is meant for cases in which

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,480
the main computational bottleneck or the

104
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
xbox says and the linear operations take

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
negligible time in comparison

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,400
like in mpc

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
8s is a generic design and not a

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,560
specific cipher so let's talk about its

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
instantiations nameless target and

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,360
poseidon each of poseidon and starkville

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
can be parameterized we denote by t the

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
number of blocks in a variant which is

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
the number of s-boxes in full round

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,599
in all of the variants only one block

115
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,200
out of t goes where an s-box in the

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
bottom round

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
the number of foregrounds before and

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
after the middle partial round is always

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
four or the number of partial lines in

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
the middle changes between the variance

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
the metric chosen for the transformation

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,440
is mds matrix

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
what it means for us is essentially that

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
in every two adjacent foregrounds at

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,759
least people small net boxes are active

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
we'll see in the next slide exactly what

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,400
it means

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,639
so the security guarantee of both

129
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,400
poseidon star card

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
is four times equals one active s book

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
cell in each

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,759
characteristic

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
in the previous slide i talked about

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
acting best boxes as a measure of

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
security against differential and linear

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
analysis

137
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
to better understand what it means i'll

138
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,199
give a little background about different

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
health analysis

140
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
in differential cryptanalysis we start

141
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
with two inputs with a known difference

142
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
and try to keep track of the difference

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,759
at every stage of the recruitment

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
process

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,639
in our case we understand only of spn

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
and partial spn in which cipher consists

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,680
of linear operations in which by

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
linearity

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
if the difference was delta then the

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
output difference must be m of delta

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
key addition which obviously does not

152
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
change the difference

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
and has boxes

154
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
so for xbox says if the input difference

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
will be zero it will remain zero as a

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
zero difference means the outputs were

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,800
the same so they will stay the same

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
otherwise we cannot no doubt a

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,960
difference for sure and in that case we

160
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
say that the xbox is active

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,639
if we'd like to know the output

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,960
difference we could only know it at a

163
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
certain probability

164
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,840
so

165
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
if the lower bound the number of

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,800
activist books says it means that the

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
probability of every characteristic will

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
be very low

169
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
now the transcendent terminology let's

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
get back to our results on poseidon

171
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,720
to get a lower bound on the number of

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
activities boxes in the process rounds

173
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
yield the tool presented in the paper

174
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,680
from 2015 by veronica

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
let's look at some examples for t equals

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
4

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
the lower bound of the active xbox set

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,479
in the full rounds is 20

179
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,560
and for the partial rounds is at least

180
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
36. for t equals 6

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
it has 28 as book 7 for the four rounds

182
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
and 32 for the fortune runs notice that

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
for all of the variants presented in the

184
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
table except for the t equals 16

185
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
the partial rounds provide better

186
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
security than the full rounds

187
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
as the main purpose of the full round is

188
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
to ensure security against statistical

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
attacks and we've seen that the partial

190
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,919
rounds can provide the same level of

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,400
security the possible effect would be to

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
reduce or even completely remove the

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
foregrounds this can cause a massive

194
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,919
speed up to the cycle

195
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
however after considering considering

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
our results the designers of the silent

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
decided to not currently reduce the

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
number of full rounds

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
as they may still provide better

200
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,199
resiliency against algebraic attacks

201
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
when we started analyzing starcad we

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
tried to use the exact same method we

203
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,639
used for poseidon and get a lower bound

204
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
using the automatic tool

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,479
we were very surprised to see that the

206
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,440
tool could not provide any lower bound

207
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
instead for the variant with 24 blocks

208
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
we found the subspace of dimension 18

209
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
which does not activate any s box in the

210
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
whole middle layer

211
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
as it turns out this substance is an

212
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
invariant subspace

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
what it means is the difference is that

214
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
starting the subspace for all the

215
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
sustained subspace and so we'll never

216
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
activate nes box regardless of how many

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,960
partial rounds there are

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,120
after we found this we naturally wanted

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
to understand why it happened so we

220
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
started studying the family of matrices

221
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,319
started uses which are cauchy matrices

222
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
specifically the i j entry of the matrix

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
is the inverse of x i plus y j

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
where x i and y j

225
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,280
are just following integer represents

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,199
elements in the field of size 2 to the

227
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,759
power of n

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,879
our results on starcad are the following

229
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
three theorems

230
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
the first is for the special case in

231
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,479
which the number of blocks t

232
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,039
is a power of 2 total decay

233
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
in which case we prove that there exists

234
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,360
an invariant subspace that does not

235
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
activate any slopes in the partial

236
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,279
rounds and its dimension is at least t

237
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,080
minus 2 which is very high

238
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
the second theorem kind of the special

239
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,479
the general case in which the number of

240
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,279
blocks is s time to the power of k where

241
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,800
s is odd

242
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
in which case we prove the lower bound

243
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
of the dimension t minus k plus one

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,839
times

245
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,320
s notice that if we evaluate here s

246
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,519
equals one

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
we get the dimension is at least t minus

248
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,279
k minus one

249
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,839
so the second theorem does not imply the

250
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
first theorem

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
the third theorem

252
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
which shows in the paper is a conjecture

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
however we proved it seems submitting

254
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
the paper so it's now a theorem

255
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
in that the dimension of the invariant

256
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
subspace in the general case is that

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,200
this t minus two times s

258
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
which is very neat as in this case if we

259
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
evaluate s equals 1 we get the first

260
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
theorem so the last theorem

261
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
implies both the first and the second

262
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
theorem

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
notice also that for the t equals 24

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,399
variant which we

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,080
looked at earlier

266
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
if we evaluate the conjecture we get the

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
dimension of the invariant substance is

268
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
18 which measures exactly what we

269
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,120
practically found

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
the way we prove the three theorems we

271
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
just saw is by studying the minimal

272
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
polynomial of the matrix

273
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
as it turns out

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
proving a higher bound of d on the

275
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,000
degree of the minimal polynomial of m

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
immediately translates to a lower bound

277
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
of t minus t on the dimension of the

278
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
invariant subspace

279
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,640
the reason why it happens is that higher

280
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
powers of m are all spanned by m to the

281
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
power of 0 until m to the power of d

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,959
minus 1.

283
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,959
we can easily see this by using division

284
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,320
with remainder of x to the power of n

285
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,600
by the minimal polynomial m of x

286
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
now if we evaluate both sides of the

287
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
equation by the matrix m

288
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,200
as the evaluation of the matrix on its

289
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
minimal polynomial

290
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
is zero

291
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
we get that m to the power of n

292
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
is equal to r of m

293
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
which is of course spanned by power of m

294
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
smaller than d as its degree is less

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,839
than

296
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,680
d the conditions for some input

297
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
difference v

298
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
to not activate any s box is that the

299
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,839
first block of v is zero so that the

300
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
first s box is not activated and then

301
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
the first block of m times v also has to

302
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
be zero so that the second x box is not

303
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,200
activated and so on

304
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
so for every round i we get a linear

305
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,519
constraint on

306
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
m to the power of i times v

307
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
as we just saw the parallels m are of

308
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,680
dimension at most d so these are only d

309
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
linear constraints and thus the

310
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,360
dimension of the solution space

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,560
must be at least t minus d

312
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
if we recall the three theorems from the

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
previous slide

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
the first claim the dimension of at

315
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
least t minus two so we need to upper

316
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,880
bound the degree of the minimal

317
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
polynomial by two

318
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
the second theorem claims the dimension

319
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
of at least t minus s plus one times k

320
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,320
which means we need to upper bound the

321
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
degree of the minimal polynomial by s

322
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
plus 1 times k

323
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
the third claims the dimension of at

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
least t minus 2s so we'll need to show

325
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
that the degree is at most 2 times s

326
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,519
to prove these results we study a class

327
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,680
of matrices which we name spatial

328
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,239
matrices

329
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
special matrices are a class of square

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
matrices of sizes which are powers of

331
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
two

332
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
it is defined using this recursive

333
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
definition

334
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,320
every one by one matrix is special and

335
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,480
bigger special matrices are symmetric

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,560
block matrices of two by two special

337
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
matrices

338
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,399
from this definition it's pretty clear

339
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,480
why the size of special matrices must be

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
a power of two

341
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,839
special matrices are a commutative

342
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,000
suffering of the ring of matrices

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
what it means is if we add the two

344
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
matrices special matrices together we

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
will get a special matrix

346
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,399
if we multiply two special matrices

347
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
together we will still get a special

348
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,519
matrix

349
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,160
and special matrices commute with each

350
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
other

351
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
the interesting stuff happens when

352
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,959
special matrices are over rings of

353
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,360
characteristic tool such as binary

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
fields which are the case in starcall

355
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,320
notice that it's important to generalize

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,880
from binary fields to binary rings as

357
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,519
matrices with polynomials as entries are

358
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,800
interesting when analyzing the

359
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
characteristic polynomial which is

360
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,839
related to the minimal

361
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,279
polynomial from now we'll only talk

362
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
about special matrices over such rings

363
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
the first property we're going to

364
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,399
discuss is that every special matrix is

365
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,720
a single eigenvalue which we denote by

366
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
lambda of n

367
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
the eigenvalue is additive and the

368
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
determinant is also additive which is

369
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
pretty unusual

370
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
finally

371
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,959
m squared is its color matrix and the

372
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
scalar is the eigenvalue of m squared

373
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
so why should we care about these

374
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
special matrices

375
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,120
as it turns out when t is the power of 2

376
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,000
the starcat matrix is a special matrix

377
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
notice however that it is not true in

378
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,839
general for kashim matrices there are

379
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,600
way more cosmetic reset than there are

380
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
special matrices

381
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,800
while not every question matrix has

382
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
special matrix every special matrix is a

383
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
koshi matrix so the special matrix sets

384
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,360
are a cool subloc subclass of the koshi

385
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
matrices

386
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,639
the reason why the koshi material says

387
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
used by star cut or special matrices is

388
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
a specific choice of the sequences x i

389
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
and y i as following integers starting

390
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
from zero which gives the matrix this

391
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
special structure

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
using what we've seen earlier as m

393
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
squared is a scalar matrix the minimal

394
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
polynomial is of degree at most too and

395
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,440
we got a lower bound of t minus 2 on the

396
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
dimension of the invariant subspace

397
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
which proves the first theorem

398
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
in the general case where t is equal to

399
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,079
s time two to the power of k

400
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
the starcad matrix is a block matrix of

401
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,519
s by s blocks each of which is a spatial

402
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
matrix of size two to the power of k by

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
two to the power of k

404
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,279
we're going to use that fact to prove

405
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,720
the second and third theorems

406
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,199
as this target matrix in the general

407
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
case is a block matrix of special

408
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,199
matrices we proceed to study this type

409
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,480
of matrices

410
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
what we prove is the following

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
take such a matrix m

412
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
and replace each block with its unique

413
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
eigenvalue lambda of n

414
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,320
what we get is a s by s matrix denoted

415
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
characteristic polynomial by q which is

416
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,519
of degree s

417
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
and what we prove is that the minimal

418
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,160
polynomial of m divides q to the power

419
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,199
of k plus 1 which is of degree k plus 1

420
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,399
times s

421
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,079
which gives us the bound of the second

422
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,440
theorem

423
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
the conjecture is that the minimal

424
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,839
polynomial also divides q to the q

425
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,880
squared

426
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
which would give us the bound of the

427
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,040
third theorem

428
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,839
some of you may remember that they

429
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,440
promised in the summary that the

430
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
invariant subspace can be used to enable

431
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
an algebraic attack on starcad

432
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
while it's obvious how such an invariant

433
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,560
subspace is useful

434
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
when attacking the cipher using

435
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
differential or linear attacks it may

436
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
not be so clear how to use it for other

437
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,479
purposes

438
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
remember that not activating any s box

439
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
means that if we take two inputs x and y

440
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,720
with difference equal to some delta from

441
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,079
the subspace

442
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,759
then the difference between the outputs

443
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,000
of the middle layer of x and y

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,079
f x and f y is equal to l of delta or l

445
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,120
is some power of the round matrix n

446
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
if we choose some x from

447
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,079
the subspace and y equals zero we will

448
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,639
get that f of x whereas the middle layer

449
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,759
is equal to l of x plus f zero which is

450
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,360
a constant

451
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
so what we got is that the middle layer

452
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,839
acts like a defined transformation for

453
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,759
inputs from the subspace

454
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,440
which is algebraic degree of 1.

455
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,199
as the main purpose of the middle layer

456
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,360
is to increase the algebraic degree

457
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,279
this invariant subspace is obviously bad

458
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,600
news

459
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
we didn't use the invariant subspace

460
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,959
ourselves to attack the cipher but left

461
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,639
it to future work

462
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
in a parallel research by benetal which

463
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,839
was published in crypto 2020

464
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,480
it was discovered that if hypothetically

465
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
the starket matrix has a small

466
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
multiplicative order d

467
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
and it is possible to mount an algebraic

468
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
pre-image attack on stargate

469
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
from their proof

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it is fairly easy to see that the exact

471
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
same hold for matrices whose minimal

472
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,599
polynomial

473
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,280
has the grid most d

474
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
which is exactly what we proved

475
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
so the invariant subspaces can be used

476
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,439
to attack starcad and the attack even

477
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,760
breaks the security guarantee for some

478
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,240
choices of parameters

479
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,160
as we've seen from star card a bait

480
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,679
choice of the matrix can lead to the

481
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
existence of big invariant subspaces

482
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,440
that pass the entire middle layer

483
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,080
without activating the single s box

484
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
in contrast to poseidon in which the

485
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
middle earth could dramatically increase

486
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,960
the security against differential and

487
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,320
linear attacks

488
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,919
in starcraft the middle layer does not

489
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
increase the security with respect to

490
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
these attacks at all and even algebraic

491
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,679
attacks can be launched against the

492
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,880
cipher

493
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
most importantly preventing preventing

494
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,760
the invariant subspace is really easy

495
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
here all we need to do is choose

496
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,160
anything which is not divisible before

497
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
following our results the authors of

498
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,160
poseidon and starcad recommended to use

499
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,679
only poseidon

500
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
and if using starcad anyway use it only

501
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,039
with an odd d

502
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,200
the lesson from the talk is to not

503
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
disregard the middle layer in the

504
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
security analysis

505
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
as we've seen

506
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
the middle layer can both boost the

507
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,600
security guarantee of the cipher and be

508
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
very dangerous when the matrix is not

509
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
chosen properly

510
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
so it is very important to always take

511
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,360
it into account and use it in the

512
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,760
security analysis

513
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
thank you very much for listening hope

514
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
you enjoyed the talk

515
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
if you did you're welcome to view the

516
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
papers to see all the props in detail

517
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,840
and that's it thank you very much
