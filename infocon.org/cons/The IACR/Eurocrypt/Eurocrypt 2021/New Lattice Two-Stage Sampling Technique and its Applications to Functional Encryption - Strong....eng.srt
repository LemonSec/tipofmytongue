00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,679
hello everyone i'm gg li

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,000
the title of our paper is new lattice

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
two-stage sampling technique and its

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,440
application of functional encryption

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,040
this is a joint work with 100

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,199
the outline of this presentation

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,359
consists of three parts

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
background or contribution at all

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,199
timings

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
first let us focus on the background

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,679
considering the scenario of a circuit

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
mass transmission

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,160
taking pke for example we always assume

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,719
that the receiver is first need to

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,000
generate a pair of pks k and then send

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
the pk to the sender bob in this case

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,440
bob can run an encryption algorithm and

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,559
send the server type city to alice

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,000
finally alice can get message m

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,440
from city

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
through using herself key

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,640
we notice that the mine coming of pke is

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
that it requires a lot of work to do

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
public key management

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,360
in order to

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
overcome this limitation we can adopt

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
ibe schemes in this case we need to

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,040
assume

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,159
authority who view issue mpk total

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,799
parties and then baba can

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
directly encrypt messages

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
using alice's id

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
finally alice can decrypt

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
through using her secret key from the

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,720
authority

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,159
in order to further increase the fine

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
grain access control for the decryptor

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,960
we can use abe schemes in this case

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,159
message

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
m is encrypted with the receiver's

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
attribute x and the receiver secret key

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
is corresponding to a function class

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,640
function f

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,759
alice view decrypt successfully if fx

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,640
equals one or above mentioned

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,119
increased games are or nothing still

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
in order to further increase the final

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
access control for the encrypted message

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,318
itself

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,920
we can use function encryption

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
in this case when decrypting through skf

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
the receiver can just obtain the partial

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
information as a fm

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,840
so we think of function encryption as

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
the most advanced inclusions still and

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,000
it is significant to construct much

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
better function encryption schemes

58
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
next we recall the syntax of functional

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,119
encryption

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,120
according to the above generalization of

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
increment schemes from pke to fe the

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
regular syntax of fee can be described

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,680
as follows first the center of algorithm

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
output appear of mpk msp second arcade

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
algorithm take npk msk and a function f

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
as input at the output

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,000
a secret key as kf here f is a function

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
from mass space to arbitrary b string

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
third the encryption algorithm directly

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
encrypts mask m under pk

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
npk

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
finally with skf we can get a fm

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
through decrypting the server test

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,400
in fact fve also has a more fine-grained

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
sentence compared with this

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,799
regular one

77
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,200
these fine green centers have the

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,239
following difference

79
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
first the function f has two different

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,159
parts at p and g where p acts as a

81
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
predict

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
whose output is 0 or 1 and the g

83
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
is a function of message

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
second the method m also has two

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
different parts x and u where x is

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
viewed as the index and u

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
the real message load

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,080
third for decryption

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,879
the decryptor get a key u if

90
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,518
p x equals one and the button otherwise

91
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
from above all we can summarize the

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
difference between regular syntax and a

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,238
fine grain syntax in in this way clearly

94
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,960
the uh thus two notions of syntax are

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,360
essentially equivalent

96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
this is the money because their function

97
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,240
class can be expressed by each other

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,919
in this paper we would like to focus on

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,919
the fine-grain syntax

100
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,680
notice that

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
function does not only capture ib

102
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,840
pe av

103
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,639
naturally but also divided in

104
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
secret key and index into

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
one zero key and private public index

106
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
respectively

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
and this will provide many more

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
perspectives to promote the current

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
status

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
of us

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,320
on rve

112
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,120
next we recall the security definitions

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
of fe schemes

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,520
generally

115
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
in a secured game for fe after obtaining

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
mpk from the challenger the adversary

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
can conduct key extraction and the

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,120
challenge queries in an adaptive way

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,479
finally

120
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,240
the adversary outpost is some

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
information offered on the chinese

122
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
advertised city in this process we need

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,919
to consider the following things first

124
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,960
from the view of the adversary the index

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
acts of the honest study generated

126
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
several times maybe public or private

127
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
second

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
the challenge attribute ice star and

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
magic star are children by the adversary

130
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
in

131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,880
selective semi-adaptive

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,639
or adaptive way

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
third key is charging queries can be

134
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440
separated into two parts

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
pre-challenging query or post john query

136
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
fourth

137
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
the summary size depends on the concrete

138
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
function class of f under the times of

139
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,039
key extraction

140
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,199
queries made by the adversary

141
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
for faith

142
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
the security

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
for this interactive game can be defined

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
in

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,560
indistinguishably based or simulation

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
based way

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
56

148
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
of course from the challenging message

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
we need to consider single or multiple

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
chinese methods

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
in this paper we might consider two

152
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
settings of every year in private index

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,199
or probably index

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,639
next we first recall on providing data

155
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,120
starting

156
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
according to the above statement about

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,599
the providing dive setting

158
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,479
the function class of fe is generally

159
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,840
denoted as

160
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
p times g

161
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
notice that after a careful

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
consideration it is significant for us

163
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
to just focus on

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
p times i

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,319
uh where i is the identity function

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
furthermore

167
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,039
for security we can consider two types

168
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,800
simulation based or andy based

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
in case of a profit index we prefer to

170
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,919
simulation-based security and

171
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,039
as it

172
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,840
it gives much more security guarantee

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
here we give the simulation based some

174
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
adaptive

175
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
security notice that in the real game

176
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,599
the same adaptive is just with respect

177
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,560
to the challenging text and store

178
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
which is children just after

179
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
receiving the master public key

180
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
then is the ideal game

181
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,319
it is necessary to consider four

182
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
simulators such that the real game and

183
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,720
the in ideal game are indistinguishable

184
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
then for the case of public index

185
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
we also consider

186
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
both sim based or id based security

187
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
first we are just interested in

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
anti-based one this is because know that

189
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,080
the indexed x is available for the

190
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
adversary

191
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
it is more significant to passive

192
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
efficiency rather than too strong

193
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
security

194
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,679
for the function class we just focus on

195
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,719
the subclass of p times i p where i p

196
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
denote

197
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,240
inner product in particular we focus on

198
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,600
ib

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,680
times ip and av times ip

200
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
more formally the ind based security of

201
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
public index of i fe can describe in the

202
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
following way

203
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,839
here we use a different color to

204
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
indicate the choice of the challenge id

205
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,920
changing challenge index in the

206
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
different states in particular they

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,640
indicate indicate

208
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,360
the

209
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,399
selective or some adaptive or

210
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,720
unadapted security respectively

211
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
next we introduce the current state of

212
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,959
art of art on simulation-based

213
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,439
fee

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
as we know the prior works have given

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,120
many results on

216
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
simulation-based ive in particular bsw

217
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
and agvw have proposed two lower bound

218
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,279
on the construction of stem fee

219
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,959
for post-challenging queries on the

220
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,640
chart and several sites respectively

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
so we can conclude that for single

222
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
challenging massive case there is no

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,000
probably a police team fee here we use

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
the first poly we indicate the number of

225
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
one key query and the second party as

226
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,399
the number of zero zero

227
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,959
zero key query

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
and then gvw gave a simulation based iv

229
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
which has a

230
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
strong security guarantee

231
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,880
by the pole efficiency in particular gbw

232
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
support q times one key under zero key

233
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,279
queries in both pre and post challenging

234
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,959
steps and

235
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
its changing that can be adaptably

236
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,240
children

237
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,959
but

238
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,640
its standard size depends on the

239
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
circuit size of f and the cluster is a

240
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,000
multiplicative

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
uh big o q two four

242
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,079
here we use q to denote the number of

243
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,360
one key

244
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,640
queries

245
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,079
then

246
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,839
gqpv they proposed fe with much better

247
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,399
efficiency but with the cost of

248
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,680
the achieved

249
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
security

250
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
then ar

251
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,670
agrowa and av

252
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,959
[Music]

253
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
also proposed a different same same

254
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
based rve

255
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
but all those constructions are still

256
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
not satisfied

257
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,839
in both security and efficiency so we

258
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
want to ask is it possible to further

259
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
promote

260
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,800
the security and the efficiency making

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
simulation-based fee to approach

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
the existing

263
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,839
lower bound

264
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
this is the detailed case of a current

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,720
state arc of simulation based ive

266
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
so this derives the first mind question

267
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
of this paper

268
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
is it possible to construct much better

269
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
simulation-based fee

270
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,760
next let us see something

271
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,360
on the current state of art on andy

272
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,320
fe for p times ip

273
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
in particular

274
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,000
hcgu proposed fe for

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,839
ip times ip

276
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
from combining ibe and fe for ip but we

277
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,760
know that even even

278
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
each building block is a adaptive

279
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
security the resulting of the

280
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,040
scheme just satisfy selective security

281
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,160
so we may consider

282
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,959
uh

283
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,120
how to construct

284
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
how how to construct ndfve

285
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,880
for av times ip and achieve the adaptive

286
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
security

287
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
this is the detailed case of the current

288
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
current state of art on simulation on

289
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,639
the

290
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,560
rve

291
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,360
and

292
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
our second question is is it possible to

293
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,399
construct much better and the best ide

294
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,440
for p times iv

295
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,760
however the mind goes in all paper can

296
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
be presented as the following two items

297
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,279
next we start to introduce our

298
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,880
contribution in this paper

299
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,480
the first is a mine technic contribution

300
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
on new lattice 2-stage sampling which is

301
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
believed to be our independent interest

302
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
and may be used in other lattice-based

303
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
cryptography

304
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
in order to explain our

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,079
new sampling process more naturally let

306
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,800
us first recall the existing lattice

307
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,720
lattice sampling techniques

308
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,000
the first is gpv sampling

309
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,720
tpv says we can sample the tuple

310
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,120
matrix a vector you write y into such as

311
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
statistically closely

312
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,839
this means that even a random matrix a

313
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
we can we cannot we cannot only first

314
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,000
sample

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,800
a vector u and then sample

316
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
vector y from this criticals and

317
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,319
distribution over largest

318
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
but also first sample

319
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,160
vector y from discrete gaussian

320
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
distribution

321
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,160
over integers and then

322
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,000
multiply it to matrix a from the right

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,639
hand side

324
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
the second is abb sampling

325
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,720
abu says that given a short matrix r

326
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
the gpv sampling algorithm still works

327
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
we can note that in the previous

328
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,600
construction of ebe or pe and even fe

329
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,720
construction from lattices this matrix

330
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
are always depends on

331
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
which secret key queries the diversity

332
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,399
contact

333
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,040
and the in that case

334
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
we require the adversary to first claim

335
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
the chinese attribute such that we can

336
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,160
embed the hard problem in the simulated

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,800
public key but this will inherently

338
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,839
result in the selective security

339
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
so if we want to achieve adaptive

340
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
or some adaptable security we need to

341
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,399
consider how to delay the usage of

342
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,120
materials are

343
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,959
in this paper we give

344
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,560
we give a new method to delay the matrix

345
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,440
are in particular

346
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,240
in

347
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
stage 1 we first choose

348
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,199
a matrix a and

349
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,920
vector x from the corresponding

350
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,480
distribution and then compute vector u

351
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,199
then in stage 2

352
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
given certain

353
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,680
small

354
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
matrix r we can sample vector z and

355
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,399
output

356
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,639
vector v in this way

357
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,279
finally the sum algorithm output the

358
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,480
tuple

359
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,199
in

360
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,120
a a times r vector u y

361
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
we notice that this tuple satisfy this

362
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
equation

363
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,480
is denoted as the sampler tool in our

364
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
paper and

365
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,639
it is essentially used in the security

366
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,320
proof

367
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,759
and in the real fe constructions we will

368
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,680
use this variant sampler one

369
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
clearly after starting on corroded

370
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,519
parameter thus two operations should be

371
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,519
indistinguishable

372
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,720
then we see or control uh we see our

373
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,560
contribution in fe with private index

374
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,279
positively all results can be divided

375
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,680
into three case three cases single qrv

376
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
reusable cable circuit and

377
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
multi

378
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,839
overall

379
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
all construction has a significant step

380
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
forward in the security and the

381
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
efficiency relative to the existing

382
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,760
result due to time limit i will not see

383
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
too much too many detailed details about

384
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
that

385
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
from above all we need obtain

386
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,080
significant progress in simulation-based

387
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
fe

388
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,960
and our result is quite

389
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
approached

390
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,880
the existing lower bound in the security

391
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
and efficiency

392
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,200
then for the fev public index

393
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
up until now there is just one paper

394
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
is acgu that have proposed and the fe

395
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,360
for ib times ip with the selective

396
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
security

397
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
and

398
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
all construction can support ap

399
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,240
times ipv the semi-adapter security

400
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
hence all contributions are still

401
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
significant just as

402
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,399
a list by this table

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
next we focus on all techniques

404
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,160
in fact our technique is in is inspired

405
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,240
by that of agua

406
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,640
and we both rely on the notion of pgpe

407
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
which means particular hiding

408
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
um predict encryption

409
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,240
so that as the first recall algorithm

410
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
tiny and then local differences from

411
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,400
them

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,799
in particular

413
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,280
these strawberries are

414
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
one zero

415
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,400
zero poly selective php and then

416
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
upgraded into

417
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,000
one poly very selective php

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,120
one poly some adaptive php two poly

419
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,840
summer wpb and

420
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,039
pure poly summer wfe we noted that we

421
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
noticed that agua has

422
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,559
limitations in security and sanitized

423
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,160
size

424
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
in particular although their

425
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,720
construction is also semi-adaptive

426
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,360
they require the adversary to commit or

427
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,240
one key queries just after no the master

428
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
public key

429
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
and this means that their construction

430
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
will not allow the adversary to conduct

431
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
the post challenge

432
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
one key queries and there certain size

433
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,600
is growth with

434
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,440
big o q 2 2 in an at that additive way

435
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
in order to further improve this scheme

436
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,960
we adopted the technique map as starting

437
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
from

438
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,000
zero poly selective php

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
and then

440
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
upgraded it to

441
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,880
a one poly selective ptpe one poly

442
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
some adaptive pgp qr poly summer wtpp

443
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,120
and the kilo polyzama wpp

444
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,039
except the

445
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,480
last last step from some adaptive

446
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,400
pdp to some adobe fe we employ several

447
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
new techniques for the three steps from

448
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,159
zero poly

449
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,200
selective ptp to pure poly

450
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,400
some adaptive ppe

451
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,000
in particular from zero poly selective

452
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
ppe to one poly selective ptpe we

453
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
adopted a new

454
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
lattice

455
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
two-stage sampling algorithm to replace

456
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,919
the corresponding sample algorithm in

457
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,480
approval

458
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,919
from one poly a selected selected pcp to

459
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,360
one poly summary ptpe we adopt a

460
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,120
lightweight encoding by pke to replace

461
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
the master of the matter of nesting two

462
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,960
of these schemes

463
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,120
from one poly summative as some adapter

464
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,240
php to qr production ppe we construct

465
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,400
post the chinese simulator

466
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,840
to answer

467
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,200
uh post challenge 1p queries and use a

468
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
more efficient car free

469
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
stat to reduce the time size growing

470
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,200
speed with q

471
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,480
up until now after putting all above

472
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,840
things together we get the desired

473
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,159
simulation based rve

474
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,400
for the case of andy based

475
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
the tiny is quite similar please say

476
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,039
your paper

477
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,840
thanks for your attentions
