00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,360
hi my name is joshua eden and in this

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,279
video i'll be presented

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,040
presenting the nested subset

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
differential attack a practical direct

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,519
attack against luv which forged the

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,080
signature within 210 minutes

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,160
this is a joint work by gentai ding

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
myself ashaka and bo yunyang

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,880
and i'll be turning off the webcam so

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,600
you can properly see the slides

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,279
first i'll talk about the general

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,279
construction of multivariate signature

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,240
schemes

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
then we'll look at the oil of vinegar

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
signature scheme in particular

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,079
then we'll look at the lifted and

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,280
balanced oil

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
vinegar scheme which is what we attack

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
in our paper

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,600
then we'll look at the subfield

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
differential attack which is our

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
original attack against we have lifted

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
them balanced oil vinegar scheme and

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
then we'll look finally look at our new

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,879
contribution the nested subset

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,960
differential attack

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,760
multivert signature schemes

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
in a multivariate signal scheme the

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
public key p is an m tuple of

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
multivariate polynomials over a finite

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,640
field

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
the private key is a way to compute p

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,040
inverse by which we do not necessarily

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,119
mean that p is invertible but we have a

35
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
way of finding three images

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
the method of signing a hash of a

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
document is finding a one of these

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
preimages x of a hash y

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
the verification process and simply

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,520
noting that y is the output p of x

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
the theoretical foundation for these

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
schemes is that solving a set of n

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
randomly chosen equations which are

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,759
nonlinear within variables is mp

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
complete with this not necessarily

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,640
ensured security of the systems

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
because p will have some hidden

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,880
structure which you can attack

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,520
for efficiency we mainly look at

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
quadratic constructions and this can be

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
justified mathematically as any set of

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
high degree polynomial equations can be

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
reduced to a set of quadratic equations

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
as in the following example

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
the oil and vinegar signature scheme

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
the oil and vinegar signature scheme was

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,960
introduced by pattern in 1997

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,439
it's both simple and efficient it was

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,280
inspired by the linearization attack to

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
the matsumai cryptosystem

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
here p the public key is the composition

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,879
of two maps f and t

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,120
f is quadratic but it's easy to compute

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
f inverse and again that means finding

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
pre-images

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
t is invariable and linear it is used to

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
hide the structure of f

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
we see that x is equal to p inverse of y

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
can be found by first computing f

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
inverse of y is equal to w and then t

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
inverse of w is equal to x

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
let f cube be the finite field of size q

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,599
and m times m and v be natural numbers

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,319
and set n is equal to m plus v

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,720
the map f is called the central map

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
there's an m tuple of quadratic

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
polynomials in n variables

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
we divide the variables in the two types

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
the first is the vinegar variables which

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
is x1 x2 up to xv

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
the second is the oriole variables x v

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,120
plus one x v plus two up to x n

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
for convenience we have the following

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
two index sets

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
v which is one two up to v

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,000
and o which is v plus one v plus two up

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
to n

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
this means that x i is a vinegar

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
variable if i is in v

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,959
and x i is an oral variable if i is an o

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,599
each central map polynomial f k is in

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
the following oil and vinegar form here

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
we're going to have vinegar times

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,680
vinegar variables

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
vinegar times oral variables vinegar by

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,360
itself

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
oil by itself and a constant where each

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
of the coefficients comes from the

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,599
finite field

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,680
notice that there are no oil times oil

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,799
terms

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
thus by guessing for each of the vinegar

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,760
variables say x i is equal to new i for

104
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,879
i and v

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,200
we have a linear polynomial in m

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
variables

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
here this will become a constant

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
this will become linear this will become

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
a constant this will stay linear and

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,760
this will stay a constant

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
thus we have a simple and efficient way

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,319
of finding a preimage of y which is an f

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,760
q to the m

114
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
first randomly guess for the vinegar

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
variables for each quadratic equation

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,238
and f of x is equal to y

117
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,320
then attempt to solve the resulting m

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,960
linear equations and m variables say by

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
gaussian elimination

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
if the solution exists then you have

121
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
found the pre-image

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
and the very unlikely event that one

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,720
does not simply try to another guess for

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
the vinegar variables

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
the reason that the different variable

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
types are called oil oil and vinegar

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
comes from salad dressing where the oil

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
and vinegar involved are not fully mixed

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,720
by the composition of t we see the

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,520
public key p of x is equal to f composed

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,160
of t of x seems to be a random quadratic

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
system as the oil and vinegar structure

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
is now hidden

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
there are some broken parameters for oil

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
and vinegar schemes the first is when v

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,919
was equal to m which is now called

137
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
balanced oil vinegar this was defeated

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,919
by kit miss and chemia using advanced

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
subspaces in 1998.

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,080
also broken is when v is less than m and

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
this can be broken by guessing for some

142
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
of the variables as this can turn it

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
into a bounce or linear system of v is

144
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
equal to m and then again you can defeat

145
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
it by the method of kidneys and chemia

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
if v is much greater than m then finding

147
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
a solution is generally easy for all

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,840
quadratic systems

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
so the usable parameters for oil veneer

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,919
schemes is v is equal to two times o

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,320
three times o or similar ratios

152
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
the ratio used for luv is slightly

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
larger

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,039
this is called unbalanced oil and

155
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
vinegar uv and direct attacks against it

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
do not work as the complexity is the

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,080
same as solving a random system

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
beyond the direct attack there are

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
attacks which make use of the uav

160
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
structure like the intersection attack

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,039
by word bullions which must be accounted

162
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,039
for in picking parameters

163
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,800
this is less efficient as the number of

164
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
variables increases as now the signature

165
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
is at least twice the size of a document

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
when you have it being twice m

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
orthoricim and so on

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
there are developments from basic uav to

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
improve the efficiency of the scheme

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
importantly one is the rainbow signature

171
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
scheme by jintae being at the deschamps

172
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
in 2005 which is a multi-layered version

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
of uv it is a nist post-quantum

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
cryptography standardization finalist

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,319
nether is luv which we'll now discuss

176
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
lifted unbalanced oil and vinegar

177
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,160
luv was a round two in this candidate

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
zoned by wood balloons at all in 2017.

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
it is a variant of uav that implements

180
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
two previous refinements of the uav as

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,759
well as the lifting modification for

182
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,080
which it is named

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
the previous two previously known

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,360
refinements will not be important for

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
our attack we only briefly describe them

186
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,720
here the first original by peter suspect

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,840
is to choose the fine transformation t

188
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
in the following shape

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
here one sub v is the v times v identity

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
matrix

191
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,919
one sub m is the m times m identity

192
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,599
matrix

193
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
and t is a v times m matrix with

194
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
randomly chosen coefficients

195
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,199
the second originally by l brick pitstop

196
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
receives a seed and a pseudorandom

197
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
number generator to generate both the

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
private key and the public key

199
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
the third modification from which lov

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,759
gets its name is the focus of our attack

201
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
lev takes an oil and vinegar private key

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
over a small field and lifts it to an

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
extension field from which it signs

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
signatures

205
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
this allows more efficient storage of

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
the public and private keys

207
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,639
let f to the r be the extinction field

208
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
of f2 of degree r and n is equal to v

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
plus m

210
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
the central map f

211
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
will take f to the r to the n to f to

212
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,479
the r to the m

213
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,680
and each of these uh polynomials f k

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
takes the oil and vinegar form however

215
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,639
the coefficients abc will only be in f2

216
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
so either 0 or 1.

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
we also choose t in the following shape

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
where t is a v times a matrix whose

219
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,719
entries are also from the small field f2

220
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
from the third modification we see the

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
public key p

222
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,599
of x is equal to f composed of t of x

223
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,320
also has coefficients only in f2 but

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,799
maps f to the r to the n to f to the r

225
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
to the m we will call such polynomials

226
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
lifted

227
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
in 2019 digit l published the subfield

228
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,240
differential attack sda against luv

229
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,440
which broke the parameters that's

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
proposed

231
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
in response the authors of lov proposed

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
new parameters which in particular made

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
the degree of the extension field prime

234
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
which protects against sda

235
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
here's a table of the six new parameter

236
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
sets our attack nsda is against the

237
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,959
three cases when r is equal to seven and

238
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,200
it breaks these completely

239
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,800
[Music]

240
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
sub-field differential attack

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
none let us describe the original attack

242
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
against luv

243
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
and the inspiration and which is the

244
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
inspiration for our new attack which is

245
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
called the subfield differential attack

246
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,440
it is a direct attack against ldv

247
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,279
meaning we will try to force a signature

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,760
x for a given message y by directly

249
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
solving p of x is equal to y

250
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
sda relies on the quotient ring

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
representation of finite fields

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,760
if we take a base field f2

253
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
and an extension field f to the r

254
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
we can write f to the r as the following

255
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
quotient ring

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,040
where d divides r and g of t is an

257
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,279
irreducible polynomial of degree r

258
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,040
divided by d

259
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,959
thus elements in f to the r can be

260
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,519
represented by degree r divided by d

261
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
minus 1 polynomials in the polynomial

262
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
ring over f to the d

263
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,079
it is more efficient to solve a

264
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,560
quadratic system over f to the d

265
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
then over the extension field after the

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
r so the goal of sda and later in sda is

267
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,279
attend

268
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
the problem solving over f to the r the

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,519
solving over f to the d

270
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
sda achieved this by selecting a random

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
differential x prime and then finding a

272
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,880
new map p tilde of x bar which takes f

273
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,079
to the d to the n to f to the r to the m

274
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,360
so x

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
bar is assumed to be an f to the d to

276
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
the n

277
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
where uh f to the d is a subfield of f

278
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
to the r

279
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
as each quadratic and p has coefficients

280
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
only in f2

281
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
and x prime is a vector of random degree

282
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
of polynomials of random degree r

283
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,560
divided by d minus one polynomials from

284
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,279
the

285
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
quotient ring by multiplying out p tilde

286
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,320
of x bar and collecting tens by the

287
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,880
powers of t we have the following

288
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
a random quadratic system q naught of x

289
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
bar of m equations

290
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,519
for when t is raised to the power of

291
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,519
zero which is just one

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440
and r divided by d minus one linear

293
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
systems li of x bar each of m equations

294
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,839
for t i

295
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
i is equal to one two and so on to r

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,920
divided by d minus one

297
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
so in sda the first signature for a

298
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,720
given message y which we will

299
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
decompose into the sum y naught plus y

300
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
one t all the way to

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
y r divided by d minus one t to the r

302
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,720
divided by d minus one but for each i

303
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
y sub i is in the vector space

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,399
f t to the d to the m where that's over

305
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,160
that intermediary field

306
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
we first find the solution space to the

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
system r divided by d minus one times m

308
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,600
linear equations l i of x bar is equal

309
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
to y i over f to the d

310
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
and then over the solution space we'll

311
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
try to find the solution to the m

312
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,440
quadratic equations

313
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
q naught of x bar is equal to y naught

314
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,440
however with the choice of prime r even

315
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
we're just having r is equal to seven

316
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
the only available subs field is f2

317
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
which is too small to find the solution

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
in all of these equations for the chosen

319
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
parameter sets

320
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
now to visualize this this is what we

321
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
were looking

322
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
the original public key

323
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
p looked like

324
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,720
p was taking a very large domain into a

325
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
relatively small range and so you'd

326
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
always expect to have at least one

327
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
solution

328
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,000
however in the sda attack we were

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,560
limiting what our domain was to what's

330
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
highlighted in green and this right here

331
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
is smaller than the range we would not

332
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
expect the solution to exist

333
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
nested subset differential attack

334
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
the nested subset differential attack in

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
sda will solve this issue by utilizing a

336
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
larger subset subset of the domain to

337
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
search for

338
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
a signature in and we will search in a

339
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
more systematic manner than simply

340
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
randomly choosing a differential

341
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,639
now first we'll define s truncation

342
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,480
for s which is going to be in between 0

343
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
and r minus 1 we define the s truncation

344
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
of an element a to be just when we limit

345
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
the powers of t to be s so originally

346
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
they could go up to r minus one now

347
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,880
eliminate them to being s

348
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,720
and we define the s truncation of a

349
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,360
polynomial to be termed by term

350
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,760
as truncations of its coefficients

351
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,000
and a system of polynomials to the s

352
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
truncation of each polynomial

353
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
individually

354
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,839
we will the subset we were searching

355
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
will be the following e to the power n

356
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
where each

357
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
of the um polynomials will be truncated

358
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
to the third power

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
now if you look on this set the domain

360
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,319
is much larger than the range again

361
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,279
now let's look at the limit on lifted

362
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,639
polynomials

363
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,839
we let f which takes f to the r to the n

364
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
to f to the r be a lifter quadratic

365
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
with it being in the following form and

366
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,480
we let a not a1 up to a l minus one be

367
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
elements in f2 to the n

368
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,720
we have that for f of a naught plus a

369
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,360
one t plus so on to a l minus 1 to the l

370
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
minus 1 plus x to the l

371
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
that this is true all the quadratic

372
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,040
terms will be coefficients of t to the

373
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
power of 2 times l

374
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
the linear terms are coefficients of t

375
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,880
to the power of l

376
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,600
to the power l plus one and t to the

377
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,079
power of two times l minus one

378
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,079
and the coefficients of t to the power h

379
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,920
depends only on what the original

380
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
coefficients are alpha and beta and the

381
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,320
ak for k is less than or equal to h

382
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
and when we have that k is going to be

383
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
greater than h they'll also depend on x

384
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
this can be shown by simply expanding

385
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
out and collecting the powers of t

386
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
for this polynomial here

387
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
using the previous sigma we will

388
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,480
construct the signature for y is equal

389
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,360
to

390
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
and here we again we're decomposing it

391
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
into the following sum

392
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,920
which of these y sub i's are going to be

393
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
elements of the

394
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,440
subfields vector space piece by tease

395
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
using differentials

396
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,639
however instead of choosing the

397
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,040
differentials randomly like an sda we'll

398
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
instead solve for them one after the

399
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,000
other for r is equal to seven this can

400
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,759
be done in four steps

401
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,000
for our attack to be efficient we will

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,839
want to always solve no more than m

403
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,480
quadratic equations over f2 for at least

404
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
as many variables as equations

405
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
throughout x-bar will be an

406
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,880
indeterminate point in f2 to the power

407
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
of n

408
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,360
first we construct the following system

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
of equations where we've taken the zero

410
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
truncation of p

411
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
at x bar

412
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
and this each of the queues is a

413
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
quadratic polynomial over f2

414
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,759
and we're going to uh let a not be a

415
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
solution the q

416
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,880
and and this right here is the um

417
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,440
term of y sub naught so we just solve

418
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
this following quadratic equation system

419
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,440
of quadratic equations over f2

420
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
second we look at the one truncation of

421
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
p bar of a naught plus x bar t

422
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
which takes the following form where

423
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,440
each of the l's are linear equations

424
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
and we'll let a1 be a solution to that

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
linear system

426
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
third we construct

427
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,279
the two truncation of p of

428
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,320
a naught plus a one t plus x bar t to

429
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
the power two

430
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,480
and we solve this linear system here

431
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
library number a to be a solution to

432
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,880
that linear system

433
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,439
finally we set capital a is equal to a

434
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,400
naught plus a when t plus a to t squared

435
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,520
and construct p of a plus x bar t to the

436
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
power of 3 and we try to find a solution

437
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
for all of this

438
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,959
over f2 to the n

439
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,199
and we do this by finding the solutions

440
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
place s for the system of linear

441
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,240
equations

442
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,119
first

443
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,720
and then we let a3 be a solution to to

444
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,240
the set of quadratic systems over this

445
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,919
solution space

446
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,200
we then have that p of

447
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
a naught plus a one t plus a two t

448
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
squared plus a three t to the power

449
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,639
three is equal to y

450
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,360
now in this day will be successful

451
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,600
provided each of the systems of

452
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
equations we tried to solve do have

453
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,720
solutions

454
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
as the four steps quadratic system is

455
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,760
the one with the least amount of

456
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
variables having first to solve the

457
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
three times in linear equations its

458
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
probability of success is what we

459
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
estimate treating the quadratic system

460
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
as a random function

461
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,039
we see that for the pregnancy given

462
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
we'll find the solution and the way that

463
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,720
we estimate this probability of success

464
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
is found in our paper

465
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,000
now the most cautious part of nsda is

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
solving the quadratic system in step one

467
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,039
and the quadratic system in step four

468
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
as these will be undetermined systems

469
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,200
over f2 a rest estimate of the

470
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
complexity required is log base 2 n to

471
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
the power of n plus 2 field

472
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
multiplications for each system using

473
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,400
exhaustive such method for here n is the

474
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
number of equations involved

475
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
this is far below the nest required

476
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
complexity for each level

477
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
in fact the complexity for the level 1

478
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,720
parameter set is so low that a practical

479
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
attack is possible against it

480
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
we ran experimental attack against a

481
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,679
public key with level one parameters and

482
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,080
were able to forge a signature in 210

483
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,960
minutes

484
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
for four details please refer to our

485
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
paper

486
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
conclusion

487
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
we have proposed a modified version of

488
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
the subfield differential attack called

489
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
nested subset differential attack which

490
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,679
fully breaks half the parameter sets

491
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,760
put forward by the round two version of

492
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,080
lifted and balanced on vinegar we have

493
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679
reduced attacking these parameter sets

494
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,600
the problem solving quadratic equations

495
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,919
over the prime field f2

496
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
this makes our attack effective enough

497
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
to be formed practically

498
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,160
thank you for watching the video we

499
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
would like to show our appreciation for

500
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,960
the support by the taft fund nist and

501
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
the nsf

502
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,360
please have a good one
