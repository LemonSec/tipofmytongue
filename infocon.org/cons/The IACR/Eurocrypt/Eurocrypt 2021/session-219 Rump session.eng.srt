1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,439
proper

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,800
to have a session

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,400

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,880

[Music]

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,760
right

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,559
so

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
enjoy your dinner and drinks we just

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,160
wanted to

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,718
remind you

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,199
we wanted to remind you on how it all

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
went for us we can barely hear her on

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
this end

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
is it better now

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,440
yes okay so we we kind of also did it

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,239
last year but then it was completely

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,000
different experience so like it just it

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
was just screen and us in the uh and we

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,159
thought okay we have to really do it

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,119
again

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,360
once we are out of this misery with the

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
online conferences and stuff you know so

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
this is the moment to kind of look back

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,680
and say okay we really we were there but

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
now it's great right

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,799
so how it all started for us it was six

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,080
years ago

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
and you know stefan is always

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
enthusiastic to organize event so again

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,280
he just loves it you know he likes to to

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
have people around he likes to do things

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,040
in croatia

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,640
we have this summer school that's

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
running for some years and 2015 was like

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
we had summer school already twice it

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
all goes well so he's like so why don't

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
we do eurocrypt and i'm like yeah really

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
do you know it's a lot of work i mean

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
don't believe what they tell you it's

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
like yeah yeah but it's really cool okay

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
so we we do what what you should do we

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
contact the ici president and we say you

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
know we would like to organize europe

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,280
oh great but we are just all sorted out

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
so nice try but next time okay we think

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
okay that's it now so forget about it

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,200
but then next year stephen comes back

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
because uh he saw kenny and kenny was in

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
zagreb on some layoff and he said wow

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
this is a great city why don't we have

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
europe here

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,080
it's just

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,560
i mean he found stefan

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
let us really like get immediately to

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,160
action and um and we say yeah okay let's

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,879
try again but then it was like no way

65
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,599
because i see our president then not

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,000
michelle told us we already have two

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
proposals locked it was darmstadt and

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
tel aviv so

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,760
yeah we are good till 2020. we said okay

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
that's it forget it

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
so we thought

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
but then um in 2018

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,040
uh ici president not michelle um he said

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
were you asking guys to organize

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
eurocrypt and we were like yeah but it

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
was like long time ago we almost forgot

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
about yeah actually you could really

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
prepare a proposal this time and prepare

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
and present it to us at the next icr

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
meeting

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
uh okay

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
check with stefan

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
so uh

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
it turned out that this meeting was like

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,080
three weeks ahead in tel aviv because

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040
then eurocrypt was in israel and we said

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
yeah okay but now we should really do it

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
because this is first time we tried

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
twice and and now they came back so

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
let's do it so we got it

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
and that was year 2018 we thought okay

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,440
we have two years ahead so plenty of

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,400
time

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,280
and and that's how we we kind of acted

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,519
like there is a lot of time we found

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,840
this venue quite soon and we thought

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
this is perfect venue we have it all

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,760
sorted out so yeah there is there is

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,519
nothing on our way so this is gonna be

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,959
great

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
and yeah so we kind of

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,200
went on

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,159
and then

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,640
2020 came

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,599
okay so now with me for 2010

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
so end of january somewhere we were

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,560
kinda ready over we were saying we are

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,439
ready

109
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
we even had the blanket fixed and there

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,760
was no show stopper for us we said yes

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
now we are everything done and then we

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
opened registration mid february and

113
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,560
then we closed registration mid-march

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
because already that time corona started

115
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,079
to be

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
quite heavy

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
influence on everything

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
and then one day later after closing

119
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
registration well we said yeah we are

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
cancelling the event in zagreb

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
and now we have unstable internet

122
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
and then yeah we said we go virtually

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
and then you you know how it goes first

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
time virtual conference you actually

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
don't know how to organize it there were

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
many many acr corona committee meetings

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
and then two days before the conference

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
last year we had

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
almost 1 000 participants and people

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
still registering and then kevin said

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
yeah we are ready i will go swimming

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,600
tomorrow so it was

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
very very interesting experience

134
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
and then early 2021

135
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
then we said well this year we

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,759
definitely have eurocrypt in zagreb this

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,120
year

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,039
and then you know how it goes first was

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,360
made then we moved to october

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
and you know

141
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,280
it took us some time

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
while virtual conferences are also great

143
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
of course but we said well hopefully

144
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,280
this can be a bit different

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,840
and finally

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
so yeah we didn't want it in may

147
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
virtually again so we pushed it again to

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
october so here we are so much better

149
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,130
right

150
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,430
[Applause]

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
yeah maybe one more for the people at

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
home

153
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,639
no sorry it's fine

154
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
they can also have beers at home that's

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
almost the same right so

156
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
uh that was it so we are happy to be

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,039
here and now just some statistics

158
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
because people love statistics usually

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
so we thought okay let's give you some

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,440
stats so this is eurocryptid numbers

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,479
we are around 260 so we still have to

162
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,720
sort out those people that paid a bit

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
later we have bank transfer and so on so

164
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
they are not like in the system yet

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
properly so that's why this number is

166
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,479
kind of tentative

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
uh those online registration are still

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,919
coming in so that's also like roughly

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,240
about 500 for sure let's see where that

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
stops because they can of course just

171
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
register anytime still

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
we had 13 sponsors that was also just

173
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
people from last year like i said in the

174
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
opening uh that had their sponsorship

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,080
sponsorships rolling over to this year

176
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,719
i'm not hearing any audio

177
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,440
there are six items in your gift bag

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
no

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
no

180
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,919
doesn't go further

181
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
okay

182
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
what did we do

183
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
very good

184
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
ah we stopped on the ah yes i i should

185
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
have gone so first starts before we get

186
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
to the gift pack so

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
this is uh what it looks like and you

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,280
can see uh it's it's eurocrypt so no

189
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
surprise right

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,240
um

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
country

192
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
also no surprise so we have france and

193
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,039
germany topping the list then the dutch

194
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,360
because we are we are organizing it

195
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,400
right

196
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
uh then it's this country of denmark of

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
our house we could say

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
uh then switzerland also did well and as

199
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
austria and then even usa is not so bad

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
14 participants yeah i think that's

201
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
quite great maybe applause for people

202
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,800
from the us that actually made it to

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
croatia

204
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
and another great stats is that the

205
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
number of students is actually higher

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
than the rest so that's also something

207
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
we're quite proud of that we got so many

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
students here some with stipends um

209
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
welcome students

210
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
and again europe versus the rest that's

211
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
all clear so

212
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
what's in the bag those six items back

213
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
to that

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,000
yes so

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
many people asked okay it seems there is

216
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
a lot of items in the bags but what are

217
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,680
they actually so we made we made a list

218
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
so you you got some chocolate it's from

219
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,279
yeah the biggest yeah

220
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,800
the chocolate part

221
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,399
the biggest

222
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,880
factory or chocolate in croatia yeah i

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
think they're quite good then you have

224
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,279
biscuits with pepper

225
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,560
then you have cookies with honey then

226
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
you have literature heart i have no idea

227
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
how to explain it but it's just

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
something for decoration do not eat it

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,279
it's a souvenir not not to eat

230
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,640
then you have a fridge magnet those are

231
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,839
made by

232
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,000
by children with disabilities so from

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
from split from the second biggest city

234
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
and then you have a postcard made by a

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
local artist so you know a mix of

236
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
everything

237
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,519
and of course we hope you like it

238
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
uh for tomorrow we have a uh

239
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
gala dinner so our banquet this is the

240
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,880
place

241
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,360
where we will have it so very important

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
we do not have gala dinner here

243
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,240
there will be buses

244
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,160
there will be buses taking you to a

245
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,959
place and returning you from that place

246
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,160
it's

247
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
25 minutes walk we walked it today so

248
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,880
it's not very far but there are buses

249
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
there will be an entertainment program

250
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,839

256
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,259
[Applause]

257
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,600
[Music]

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
so it is not it

259
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
so time when the bus sleeve uh so since

260
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,160
seven

262
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,079
uh we will have buses leaving from 6 20

263
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,040
in front of hotel up to 6 45 there will

264
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,839
be five buses you know every five six

265

minutes so please try to be on time

266
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,959

267
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,839
hour

268
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,640
so

269
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,120
we cannot really stay very long here

270
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
with buses

271
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,680
and now that's it all right thank you

272
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,959
very much

273
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,000
and now

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,160
next on is fx giving the report from the

275
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
program chairs you should just press

276
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
space and then your slide should be up

277
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
now okay

278
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
thank you

279
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,519
so

280
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,240
good good evening everyone um i will say

281
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
a few words about how we selected the

282
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,279
papers together with them

283
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,000
so

284
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
uh starting with it's very hard to hear

285
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
can you hold the mic closer please

286
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,959
sorry

287
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,519
it's very hard to hear you

288
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,880
good

289
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
um

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
so the first one is very classical we

291
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
try to build a balanced program based on

292
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
on the best submissions that we received

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
and for us it translated essentially

294
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
into

295
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
trying to ensure equal standards for all

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,079
the papers we received and for example

297
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,839
having the same need of some reviewers

298
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,519
for all the topics

299
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
so in other words this really means we

300
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,079
had to build a program committee

301
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
that reflects the the diversity and i

302
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
would say the rich diversity of topics

303
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,440
of the acs

304
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,399
the second thing which is maybe a bit

305
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
less classical is we we wanted to try at

306
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,279
least making the review process

307
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
a bit less adversarial

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
and and by this we mean we wanted to

309
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
decorate

310
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
the objective and the subjective parts

311
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,920
of the reviews and for example help

312
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
interpretation for the authors

313
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
by making a link between the the

314
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
recommendations of the authors and the

315
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,480
different parts of the reviews

316
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,240
so as a typical example we wanted to

317
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
avoid that somebody receives a strong

318
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
reject because of subjective reasons

319
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
which we don't find completely fair

320
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
so for the first point for the topic

321
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
balance

322
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,399
the problem essentially is that the

323
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,800
distribution of the topics that we will

324
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
have that we will receive at the

325
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
conference is not known apriori so we

326
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
had to make a guess

327
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
for the pc our choice was to rely on the

328
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,800
area conferences that we have within

329
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
aicr

330
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,680
and the guests was 10 people for all the

331
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
the conferences and workshops

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,120
except that 2040 tcc because we accepted

333
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
expected higher number of theory

334
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,959
submissions

335
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,040
the other thing that we tried doing with

336
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
with the limitations of the people who

337
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
answer positively is to favor the

338
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
researchers who work on multiple topics

339
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,079
because they obviously helped to

340
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,480
compensate their horse on our guests and

341
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
also to ensure

342
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
some kind of geographical age and gender

343
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,000
balance

344
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,279
so that was the prairie

345
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,839
this is what we got a posteriori so

346
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,079
the plots represent the distribution of

347
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
the submissions in terms of topics so

348
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
again checks fscpkc

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,319
lwcn and tcc

350
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
okay so yeah as expected we see a higher

351
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
number of theory submissions and on the

352
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
left you have submissions on the right

353
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,920
you have accepted papers i think

354
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
the main message here or what was

355
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
interesting to us is that once you have

356
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,839
a pc that is able to cover all the

357
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,279
topics

358
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
you get a program that reflects the

359
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
submission and the distribution of the

360
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
submissions quite

361
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
naturally i would say and we we really

362
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
didn't have to intervene much in the

363
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
decisions i will come back to that

364
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
so the second thing was this idea of

365
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
trying making the reviews less

366
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
adversarial and the main tool that we

367
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,079
used for that purpose is the review form

368
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,399
so we wanted to have a review where the

369
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,320
reviewers or some reviewers

370
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,880
answer the questions consecutively

371
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
and a bit simplified the first question

372
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
is essentially is the paper novel and

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
correct which is something very minimum

374
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
if the answer is no at this stage you

375
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
get a strong reject if it's yes you move

376
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
to the second question

377
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
second question is is the paper

378
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,199
understandable

379
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
more editorially i would say so is the

380
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
paper containing sufficient details to

381
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
convince the reviewers

382
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
if you get a note there you have a weak

383
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
reject if you get away yes you move to

384
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
the third question

385
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
and the third question is this more

386
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
difficult question of whether the paper

387
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,880
is deemed important by the reviewers

388
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
and and there we insisted several times

389
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
that there's no

390
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
universal definition of what is an

391
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,320
important paper

392
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
so that's where having a broad pc was

393
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,639
very important and the only thing that

394
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
we could do is to rely on on this pc

395
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
at this stage if you get a no it becomes

396
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
a borderline paper if you get an a yes

397
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
you get it don't accept a weak accept

398
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
and among those papers you can still be

399
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,160
accepted or rejected because of

400
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
competition which is high

401
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,440
um what we hope with that uh is that

402
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
somehow it would help reviewers and

403
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,440
authors understand or get useful

404
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,040
feedback in particular if you have

405
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,800
strong and weak rejects

406
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,279
you should have useful feedback and

407
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,000
several times we observe that

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
the constructive parts of the reviews

409
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
the parts of the reviews that contain

410
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,000
recommendations for improving the paper

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
were related to these first two

412
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,600
questions

413
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
i would say if you have a paper accepted

414
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,880
obviously you're happy and then we

415
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
remain with these papers that are

416
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,959
between borderline and maybe actually

417
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,920
accept

418
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,079
and that they did not get a slot in the

419
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,480
conference

420
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
which i will call annoying at the moment

421
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
and i will come back to that

422
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,519
based on that how we worked was was also

423
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,759
very sequential so we had several steps

424
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,199
in the reviews

425
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
the first one was before the orbital and

426
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,640
the idea there was really to identify

427
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,559
all the papers for which we were unsure

428
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,480
about technical correctness for which we

429
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
had questions

430
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,000
to help us decide whether they were good

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
enough

432
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
at this stage we typed all the papers

433
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
where we had those questions are papers

434
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,079
that were critically

435
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
for which the habitat was critically

436
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,439
needed

437
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
for all the other papers

438
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,400
most of them we should have added a tax

439
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
saying that hospital was not critically

440
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
needed we still allow daughters to to

441
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
answer or to put a hospital but i think

442
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,799
it's important to say that in those

443
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,440
cases reputation is very rarely useful

444
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
so

445
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
after this step

446
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
we we worked from the bottom so the

447
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
second step was to try identify all the

448
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,039
papers that we had to reject because of

449
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,559
what we call objective reasons so

450
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,080
reasons related to the first two

451
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,160
questions either the paper was incorrect

452
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,039
or not novel or we had serious

453
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,039
problems in terms of editorial quality

454
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,760
and then finally the last step was

455
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
moving from the top so at this stage we

456
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,039
will

457
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
try to make an iterative acceptance of

458
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,400
piles of 25 papers

459
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
briefly we never made any global vote

460
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
but we asked approval of the pc after

461
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
every selection of 25 papers more or

462
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,400
less

463
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,440
we try to use discussion and consensus

464
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
much more than great switch at some

465
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
point in the the discussion are not so

466
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,120
reflective anymore

467
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
and i would say for the first 50 papers

468
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
there was really no doubt they came

469
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
directly with good balance and no

470
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
discussion

471
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
the last 25 papers they are difficult

472
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,919
because because you have so much

473
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
competition and papers with pros and

474
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,760
cons and so on

475
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
so the only thing that we did at this

476
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,160
stage

477
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
was to say to the pc again we have no

478
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
unifor universal definition of what is

479
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,120
good but try to look at program balance

480
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,799
try to make everybody happy to attend

481
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,480
the conference

482
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
and maybe also look at your individual

483
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,400
acceptance rate because it's clear that

484
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
some people are more

485
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,240
gentle or severe than others and this is

486
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,440
to be taken into account

487
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,679
our conclusions essentially we we think

488
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,080
this review form and process was

489
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,520
useful to make the reviews less

490
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
adversarial and

491
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
we had at least feedback in this

492
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
direction

493
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
and that's also something we observed i

494
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,919
would say this is when reviewers

495
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,360
followed the review form which was

496
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,520
unfortunately not always the case

497
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,039
one side effect that we didn't

498
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
anticipate at all is that this fact that

499
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
comments were somehow more positive made

500
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,559
more writers think that their paper

501
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,400
would be accepted and some were even

502
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
more disappointed afterwards so that's

503
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,720
something we should have communicated

504
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
better about

505
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
and in the end it's true that paper

506
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
could have been accepted so maybe we

507
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
should

508
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
update better the reviews after the

509
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,520
decisions but this is where the time is

510
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
usually missing

511
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
and and coming back to these annoying

512
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
papers we wanted to show this

513
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
statistic which is quite interesting i

514
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,600
think so here in green you have the

515
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,240
accepted papers in blue the papers that

516
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
we rejected for what we call objective

517
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
reasons for questions one and two

518
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,960
and in orange you have all the papers

519
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
rejected for subjective reasons so the

520
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,120
short summary is that we could have

521
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
doubled the program size

522
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,760
still following the comments of the pc

523
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
and and accepting papers that were

524
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,120
deemed good enough for for your crypt

525
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
so how to deal with that is i guess an

526
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
interesting question for the community

527
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
and last but not least we wanted to say

528
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
a huge thank you to all the people who

529
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
people who helped us which means authors

530
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,919
pc members a wheelchair sub reviewers

531
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
organizers

532
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
and i think we would like to see

533
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
especially the the pc um

534
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,919
even if the process remains imperfect

535
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,120
and probably will always remain

536
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,559
imperfect

537
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
it's extremely impressive to see all

538
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,520
this this pc working

539
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
we were i think amazed by that and very

540
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,840
happy with the results so

541
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
thank you again and we hope you enjoyed

542
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,080
the program as much as we did thank you

543
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
thank you very much fx

544
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,919
and next on is uh the president of the

545
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
iacr michelle abdullah and just in case

546
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
that you submitted slides to the rum

547
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,559
session and wanted to change them last

548
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,880
minute so did michelle and we did also

549
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,919
not make an exception for michelle so

550
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,760
you see it's same rights for everyone

551
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
here

552
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,000
you should just press space and your

553
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
slides should be up some version of your

554
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,679
slides

555
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,790
wrong

556
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,930

uh awards ceremony of era crypt 2021

560
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,960
it for me i'm quite happy to be able to

561
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
participate

562
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,559
in person it was

563
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,880
doubtful at one moment

564
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,600
but i'm really glad that we were able to

565
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,480
actually have the ceremony with uh and

566
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
actually to have a very large number of

567
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,320
attendees

568
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,120
here in person so i'm very glad for that

569
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
and thank you it was stefan and lila for

570
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,440
all the effort

571
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,799
so

572
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,000
first i would like to recall uh some of

573
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
the new fellows

574
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,919
that were inducted this year

575
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
uh for uh

576
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,039
for acr

577
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,559
first if you're not familiar with the

578
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,120
icr fellows program

579
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
the goal of this program is to

580
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,720
recognize outstanding iacr members

581
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
for their technical professional

582
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,919
contributions

583
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,159
in particular that

584
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,120
advance the science uh

585
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,840
of cryptology and related fields

586
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,039
that promote the free exchange of ideas

587
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,919
uh

588
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,000
about crypto and related fields

589
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
and uh

590
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
developed and maintained the

591
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,000
professional skills

592
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
integrity of individuals

593
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
in the cryptology cryptologic community

594
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
and finally to advance the standing of

595
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
the cryptologic community in the wider

596
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,919
scientific and technical world

597
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,000
so this year

598
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
we had five new fellows that were uh

599
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,310
selected by the fellow selection com

600
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,960
[Music]

601
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
committee and the committee this year

602
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,120
was presided by ronald grammer

603
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,120
from uh cwi and leiden university

604
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,919
uh and with the other members were ponjo

605
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
kim analyzenskaya daniel michoncho and

606
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,480
kenny patterson

607
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,480
so the five new fellows that were

608
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,440
selected this year was

609
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,240
the first one craig gentry as you know

610
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,559
who also was the invited speaker for

611
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,200

leonid razen and ingrid vebawad

615
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,480
so let me just briefly recall

616
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,320
the reason they were selected so craig

617
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,200
in particular was elected a fellow

618
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640

encryption and other fundamental

621
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,000
contributions to cryptography

622
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,159

652
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,080
of applause for all the new fellows

653
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,440
and

654
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,039
it is

655
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
like unfortunately none of them could be

656
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
present uh this time

657
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,320
but

658
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
the hope is that in a future event we

659
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,960
will be able to hand handle them a plug

660
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
in person

661
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,760
and uh

662
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,840
hopefully that will happen next year

663
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,559
so in addition to that uh i would like

664
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,320
to mention

665
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
also

666
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,520
the test of time award

667
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
for

668
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,799
these slides were supposed to be there

669
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,960
but

670
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
so as you know the test of time award

671
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
recognizes papers

672
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,360
with that uh

673
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
that had a lasting impact in the field

674
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,640
and usually uh for air for the general

675
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,919
conferences

676
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,880
meaning

677
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
eurocrypt asia crypt and crypto

678
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,679
this the selection process chooses

679
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,399
papers that are

680
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,960
awarded papers that were published 15

681
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880

challenging this last few years the last

857
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,760
year and this year to deal with covid

858
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,000
and all the uncertainty and it wasn't

859
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,240
clear at all even when we decided to

860
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,680
postpone the conference to october to

861
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,079
hopefully hold it in person

862
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,160
that this would take place

863
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,400
and then once it became

864
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
it looked like it would work

865
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,599
uh

866
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,720
making it happen it was also not

867
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,599
clear how we would do handle half of the

868
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,119
speakers being

869
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,920
uh online and half of the speakers being

870
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
here so

871
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
together kevin k

872
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,040
have

873
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,440
worked a lot with this with the help of

874
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,640
us is

875
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,920
japan and leila to make it work to come

876
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
here to test the system

877
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,160
so of course not everything works

878
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,599
perfectly

879
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,560
but

880
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
i think things have been going really

881
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,119
well and i'm really impressed with

882
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,440
the the final result

883
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,680
of course we can always hope for to

884
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,680
improve the next version and you will

885
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,720
your feedback is always welcome

886
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,960
and we hope to actually

887
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,880
ask for your feedback

888
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,240
later

889
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,079
but yeah i would like to take this

890
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,839
opportunity to thank kevin k stefan and

891
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,640
layla for this this amazing work thank

892
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,640
you

893
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
all right thank you very much yeah and

894
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
uh kevin we just kind of had to put that

895
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,320
picture from your website to good use

896
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,440
um

897
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,560
so this

898
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,440
uh

899
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,440
brings us to the rum session proper

900
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
which where the slides won't come up

901
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,989
[Music]

902
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,800
ah wait

903
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,569
[Music]

904
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,469
[Music]

905
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,160
next

906
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,869
[Music]

907
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,640
it's actually not easy to handle this

908
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
while holding the microphone share

909
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,839
screen

910
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,799
and here we are

911
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
all right

912
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,720
so this brings us to the rum session

913
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
proper and i must say it's actually

914
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,720
absolutely amazing to be in a room again

915
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,200
with that many cryptographers after

916
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
pretty much two years

917
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
and what's even more amazing is to see

918
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,119
so many new faces that i haven't seen

919
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,680
before at conferences so i was wondering

920
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,359
how many people here are actually

921
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,599
attending at the moment the first

922
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,680
in-person crypto conference in their

923
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,240
life could you maybe raise your hands

924
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160
i think this is a very very impressive

925
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,240
race of hands here i think this is

926
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,118
actually worth a round of applause

927
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,640
i i also figured because there's so many

928
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,320
people that haven't been attending a

929
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,079
crypto conference before

930
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,839
there's equally many people who haven't

931
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,160
attended a proper ram session before

932
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,599
so we felt like we should maybe give you

933
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,440
a bit of an introduction to

934
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,520
what a rum session is and what would be

935
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,960
better than a bit of a historic

936
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,720
perspective to just you know give you

937
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,119
the background

938
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,920
when

939
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,319
i first attended like heard the word rum

940
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,319
session i thought okay you can google

941
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,079
this right and you google the word well

942
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,520
you know what a session is right but you

943
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
google the word romp

944
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,520
and well basically what comes up is kind

945
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,599
of this picture

946
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,359
which gives you an idea of what a ram

947
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,359
session is about it's sort of about the

948
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,040
behind right

949
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,200
so which makes sense because it's always

950
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
at the end of a conference day

951
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,720
but it also makes sense in a different

952
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,680
sense

953
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,880
because

954
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,680
the

955
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,720
ramp sessions are very closely related

956
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,520
to

957
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,480
the concept of cryptology

958
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,359
and

959
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,800
cryptology

960
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,079
is

961
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,480
defined as relating to cryptography and

962
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,119
incorporating results that fall into one

963
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,440
or several of the following categories

964
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,400
it's funny

965
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,599
it's controversial or it's crap

966
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,359
this is not my definition

967
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,079
this is the definition of the seminal

968
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,160
journal in its field the journal of

969
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,520
cryptology

970
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,040
if you don't know of this journal you

971
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,640
find the website of it

972
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,800
and no it's not a mistake that there is

973
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,680
an s missing behind the http it is after

974
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
all about craptology

975
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
now why is this important for you to

976
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,599
know as young cryptographers entering

977
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,960
this field

978
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
well at some point after you've

979
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,359
successfully obtained your phd

980
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,000
you will be applying for jobs

981
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,599
and well first maybe for a postdoc

982
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,920
position and then for a faculty position

983
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,599
and at the moment you may have this

984
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,560
impression

985
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,720
that there is a selection committee

986
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
sitting there hiring committee

987
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,520
and that you will be evaluated based on

988
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,040
your accomplishments in the field of

989
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,400
cryptology

990
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,560
it's maybe true if it's not an expert

991
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,599
hiring committee however if you have a

992
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,920
truly expert hiring committee they will

993
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,040
be evaluating you purely on your

994
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,520
achievements in the field of cryptology

995
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
well that's at least how i believe i got

996
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,119
my job

997
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,560
now what are these achievements in the

998
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,880
field of cryptology

999
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,200
the most important one the off the plane

1000
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,960
achievement is you give your first rum

1001
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,160
session talk

1002
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,200
if you're not giving your first drum

1003
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,359
starter session talk today you should do

1004
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,119
that at the next event that features a

1005
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,520
rum session

1006
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,280
there is the golden voice achievement

1007
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,760
it's next level you sing or you play a

1008
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,520
song in a ramp session and if you need

1009
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,040
some good examples of how that worked

1010
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
out in the past there's a website

1011
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,000
collecting those at ramp.com

1012
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,240
the serious fun achievement is to win

1013
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,360
the best drum session presentation award

1014
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,119
[Music]

1015
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,520
then of course the real deal

1016
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,839
an accepted paper in the journal of

1017
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,760
cryptology

1018
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,880
you would think it ends there but no

1019
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,160
the soliciting award is an invited paper

1020
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,839
in the journal of cryptology it's

1021
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,800
actually highly related to the serious

1022
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
fun because you may receive an email

1023
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
from the editor in cheek

1024
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,000
asking you to submit a paper to the

1025
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,480
journal of cryptology

1026
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,400
finally the full circle

1027
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,040
achievement have a j crypto paper and

1028
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,440
have it cited in a paper at a crypto

1029
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,440
conference

1030
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,560
now back to the rum sessions what is our

1031
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,359
role as romp session shares

1032
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,400
well you may be used to this scientific

1033
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,720
evaluation process of submissions around

1034
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,440
sessions are nothing like this it's

1035
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,640
just pure dictator rule here we just

1036
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,000
receive

1037
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,160
submissions we do with them however

1038
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,079
whatever we're pleased to do

1039
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,040
there is however one extremely important

1040
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
responsibility of rom session shares

1041
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,880
it's the following

1042
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,520
sometimes just receive submissions where

1043
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,280
somebody just thought that their paper

1044
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,720
should have been accepted at the

1045
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,880
conference but it was rejected

1046
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
so they submit the talk that they were

1047
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,359
planning to give and just think well

1048
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,800
obviously i'll just give that talk in

1049
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,319
the rum session

1050
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,760
remember run sessions are about

1051
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,640
cryptology so you need to stop that

1052
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
in other words you need to kick people

1053
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,200
off stage if they run over time

1054
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,280
historically i remember quite vividly

1055
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,920
various means of doing this that often

1056
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,720
involve noise making devices

1057
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,359
for example vuvuzelas

1058
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,520
a chinese gong that featured at chess

1059
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,760
2018

1060
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,240
electric guitars

1061
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,800
and not noise making but extremely

1062
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,359
efficient at chess 2011 a ninja

1063
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
now

1064
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,119
we're not going to do any of that we're

1065
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,520
just going to mute people

1066
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,760
after all we're in a hybrid setting here

1067
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,720
so we have that power

1068
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
now you would think that's it but at

1069
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,079
asia crypt 2018 in brisbane australia

1070
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,920
craig costello leo dicar and pierre

1071
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,800
cartman revolutionized the operational

1072
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,280
procedures of ram sessions

1073
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,640
what they did

1074
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,680
is they introduced a method for speakers

1075
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,280
to buy extra time

1076
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,720
how did that work

1077
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,440
well speakers either had to eat a spoon

1078
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,260
of vegemite

1079
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,400
[Music]

1080
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,960
or they had to drink a bottle of this

1081
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,839
terrible australian beer bottoms up

1082
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,280
it turns out

1083
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,599
that vegemite is pretty hard to get in

1084
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,440
croatia

1085
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,880
and we would certainly not want to

1086
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,800
impose australian beer on our speakers

1087
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,599
so we slightly adapted that method

1088
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,200
and we have sliverwiza

1089
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,880
so to all of the speakers in the rum

1090
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,960
session and in particular those who

1091
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,400
already remarked that they will need

1092
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,680
more time

1093
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,520
you see here lined up shots of

1094
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,040
schlieverbitsa

1095
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,720
and whenever you're running out of time

1096
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
simply drink one of those and you get 30

1097
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,118
seconds extra

1098
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,400
so

1099
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
with this there's only two procedural

1100
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,760
things for me to

1101
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,200
tell everyone

1102
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,280
one is please keep an eye if you're a

1103
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,640
speaker please keep an eye on the

1104
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,520
program and if you're up next already

1105
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,359
come here so we don't have to wait too

1106
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,520
much between talks we concatenated all

1107
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,760
pdfs so we can just basically go through

1108
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,200
there shouldn't be much delay in between

1109
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,520
the world is 20 shots lined up once

1110
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,040
those are gone we will resupply

1111
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,880
all right

1112
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,400
um

1113
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,240
the other remark is and that is

1114
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,400
important for the remote speakers we

1115
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,319
won't have remote speakers share their

1116
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,480
screen you should only unmute yourself

1117
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,880
and maybe share your video but we will

1118
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,560
advance your slides they're in the same

1119
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,400
deck with all the other slides so i will

1120
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,880
be standing here in the front and an

1121
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,319
advanced slides when you say next slide

1122
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,480
i will go to the next slide

1123
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,760
so with this

1124
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,800
i would like to conclude this

1125
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,240
introduction to the ramp session and

1126
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,680
wish you all a pleasant rum session

1127
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,119
the first talk up is actually one of the

1128
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,559
remote talks

1129
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,280
and oh thank you very much i get brc

1130
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,400
this is the

1131
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,800
great uh part of being a rom session

1132
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,319
chair so uh craig could we try this

1133
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,079
could you unmute yourself and ideally

1134
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,920
also share your video although we don't

1135
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,599
see this here

1136
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,760
can you see me peter

1137
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,200
we can hear you

1138
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,160
you can hear me but not see me

1139
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,240
we can see you

1140
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,079
i know we can also see you awesome nice

1141
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:58,880
great

1142
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,040
so craig you're up i'll advance your

1143
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,000
slides

1144
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,520
and what do i what can i drink to buy

1145
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,680
more time

1146
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
well ah yeah so of course the sliver

1147
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,240
with shots are only available to local

1148
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,720
speakers

1149
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,760
um so yeah thank you peter um okay so

1150
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,440
as i'm sure you all know

1151
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,760
the uh super singular computational

1152
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,440
diffie-hellman problem

1153
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,520
is by far the strongest and hardest

1154
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,760
problem in all the public key crypto

1155
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,599
it's been around for over 10 years now

1156
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,319
and there's been zero progress in crypt

1157
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,319
analyzing it so much so that the

1158
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,720
original versions of the problems that

1159
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
were proposed actually turned out to be

1160
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,040
stronger than the the initial authors

1161
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,240
said

1162
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,400
and so that's why what we've had to do

1163
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,079
to create some challenges for these for

1164
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,079
these problems is to create uh some mini

1165
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,920
toy instances

1166
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
uh and to put up some big cash bounties

1167
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,599
on them with the with thanks to the

1168
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,400
microsoft uh bug bounty team

1169
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,079
so we had we've posted two problems

1170
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:00,880
a

1171
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,440
five thousand dollar problem for psycp

1172
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,160
182 and a fifty thousand dollar problem

1173
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,440
for psycp 217

1174
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,960
and those those were posted at the nist

1175
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,480
conference uh back in uh june or july

1176
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,440
and

1177
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,640
turns out that the 5 000 problem has

1178
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,680
already been

1179
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,520
solved can you go to the next slide

1180
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,839
peter

1181
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,160
so i'm here today to congratulate

1182
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,680
uh press the next slide again peter

1183
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,480
alexey udovanko from crypto experts in

1184
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,280
paris and griseppi veto from the

1185
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,440
university of luxembourg

1186
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,359
they both submitted a solution to the

1187
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,480
challenge psych p182 a correct solution

1188
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,839
on a saturday

1189
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,640
august 28 2021

1190
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,280
so ideally i would have been there

1191
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,480
with a uh with a briefcase full of full

1192
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
of cash well maybe full of one dollar

1193
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,839
notes or pennies but uh since i can't be

1194
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,079
there and we're gonna have to probably

1195
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,400
transfer the money um in the boring kind

1196
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,119
of

1197
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,760
uh wired fashion i believe the ramp

1198
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,160
session chairs have a placeholder gift

1199
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,280
there

1200
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,440
so yeah could you please uh alex sanchez

1201
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,880
pepper could you please come to the

1202
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,520
front to get a placeholder gift

1203
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,960
if you're here

1204
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,200
otherwise we save a placeholder gift i

1205
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,119
think at least one of the two

1206
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,480
crypt analysts are there in person

1207
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,880
apparently they're not here craig

1208
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,480
we have to drink more sliver pizza

1209
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,680
okay neither of them are there well

1210
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,920
so if any one of you knows um where they

1211
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,160
are they can still come here to the rum

1212
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,720
session chairs and get their placeholder

1213
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,800
gifts i've got a placeholder gift

1214
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,960
sitting at the top there and

1215
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
they've got a

1216
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,240
deck of cards against cryptography i've

1217
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,160
asked the inventors of that game to

1218
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
kindly share two decks they're going to

1219
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,440
both get a deck of cards against

1220
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,280
cryptography in the mail and they'll be

1221
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,319
wired their money uh in due time

1222
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,160
but i want to congratulate the two crypt

1223
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,520
analysts again

1224
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,920
and ask them and everybody else

1225
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,000
to peter next slide please

1226
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,079
to take a look at the the two urls on

1227
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,920
this slide there's still fifty thousand

1228
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,680
dollars up for grabs

1229
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,420
for the bigger

1230
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,519
[Music]

1231
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,800
all right i guess that uh kind of ends

1232
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,440
craig's talk

1233
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,599
so

1234
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,760
a quick you just froze and uh and lost

1235
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,599
audio so i think we will advance to the

1236
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,599
next uh next talk

1237
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,040
i think your time was over anyway and

1238
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,800
you didn't have shots to drink

1239
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,000
so

1240
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,440
that brings us

1241
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,040
to the talk by ragbendra

1242
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,839
and that is also remo talk so could you

1243
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,319
please unmute yourself

1244
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,520
and

1245
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,040
can you save me

1246
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,240
can you see

1247
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,720
yeah okay yeah so

1248
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,720
okay yeah that's great so uh i will

1249
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,040
present uh some of our recent uh

1250
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,960
cryptanalysis results on the speedy

1251
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,920
block cipher so this is an uh ongoing

1252
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,400
work with santorum surfer so could you

1253
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,440
please go to next slide

1254
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,200
uh next slide please

1255
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,480
yeah so yeah speed is like an ultra

1256
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,640
latency block cipher which was recently

1257
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,160
proposed by leander moose moradi and

1258
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,839
rasul jada in

1259
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,760
chess 2021

1260
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,920
yeah i think so you can go to next slide

1261
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,920
again

1262
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,640
yeah so if you look uh so here the block

1263
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,280
size and case size are 192 bits and

1264
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,160
uh so the round cipher is basically

1265
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,000
described in this figure so first your

1266
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,160
uh first are minus two rounds

1267
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,359
follows something like a

1268
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,119
description of the left side of figure

1269
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,240
and the

1270
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,480
uh the last r minus round is

1271
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,240
where you omit the mixed columns uh

1272
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,319
layer so here uh

1273
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,240
then only the non-linear operation is a

1274
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,880
6-bit option 6-bit s-box and the rest

1275
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,119
other like 6 columns and mixed columns

1276
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,280
are linear operation

1277
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,400
so can you go to next slide

1278
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,720
yeah okay so yeah in terms of speedy

1279
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,400
variants and security claims so the

1280
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,920
designers have proposed are three

1281
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,160
variants so with rounds five six and

1282
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,240
seven and four practical applications

1283
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,760
they propose like uh

1284
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,000
they consider the security claim as like

1285
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,880
uh your data should be posted for 64 and

1286
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,680
time at least for 128 while for six

1287
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,680
round they say like it achieves at most

1288
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,800
128 bit security but for seven rounds at

1289
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,760
uh at 192 bit security yeah next right

1290
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,079
please

1291
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,079
yeah however uh in their design uh in

1292
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,079
their uh paper they did not provide any

1293
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,880
distinguishers and executive attacks

1294
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,760
yeah next week

1295
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,640
yeah that's uh that's the thing yeah so

1296
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
here what we did yeah we analyzed the

1297
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,319
two rounds of speeding so the two

1298
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,680
complete fold rounds which are shown in

1299
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,520
the red and we found like two

1300
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,520
distinguishes one with data complexity

1301
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,040
due to power fourteen and another with

1302
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,839
data complexity two to four thirty so if

1303
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,000
you see like uh the entire two rounds

1304
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,400
has like four uh passes of xbox but

1305
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,200
still

1306
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,880
we found like the distinguishes with

1307
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,720
very low data complexity so can you go

1308
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,359
to the next slide

1309
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,760
yeah so the uh the discharges are very

1310
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,920
uh like fairly simple so you choose four

1311
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,440
different s boxes uh which are so uh

1312
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,680
uh useful you choose like uh

1313
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
some cube 14 cube variables in four

1314
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,280
distinct s boxes which are given there

1315
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,799
and then you find that after two full

1316
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,240
rounds the xor sum in uh registers one

1317
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,599
two and three is always zero with

1318
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,359
probability one

1319
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,880
so this is one of the distinguisher uh

1320
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,319
the next distribution works with our

1321
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,400
data complex 2 to the power 30 here it's

1322
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,319
something uh strange so if you remove

1323
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,640
one cube variable then you find that uh

1324
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,720
this super polysecond three indices are

1325
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,920
always equal

1326
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,760
so that's something weird you so this

1327
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,880
means uh

1328
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,960
a part of the boolean function is always

1329
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,280
equal after two rounds

1330
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,640
can you go to next slide

1331
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,960
yeah so uh so these two rounds can be

1332
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,640
directly extended to a three round key

1333
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,960
recovery attacks so

1334
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,799
so all the recovery attacks are

1335
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,559
practical and they work for all three

1336
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,799
variants of spd and if you just remove

1337
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,559
the pre-fighting key then it can be

1338
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,359
trivially extended to four rounds

1339
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,160
yeah next slide

1340
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,760
yeah i think yeah that's uh all from my

1341
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,319
side thank you

1342
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,319
thank you very much

1343
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,480
and

1344
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,799
the next talk is given by muhammad the

1345
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,160
summer sadar

1346
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,640
some it's also remote talk

1347
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,200
afterwards we will be resuming two more

1348
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,440
um in-person talks

1349
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,240
so

1350
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,680
ah there you are

1351
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,720
okay

1352
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,680
so do you hear

1353
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,160
do you hear and see me as well

1354
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,440
yes we do

1355
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,799
okay perfect

1356
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,759
so welcome everyone

1357
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,760
okay so do you hear me right

1358
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,760
peter

1359
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,680
yes we hear you

1360
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,760
okay perfect so so i assume everything

1361
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,760
is well on the other side as well okay

1362
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,520
so this talk is about confidential

1363
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,559
computing and it's relation to

1364
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,839
uh other techniques in the domain of

1365
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,760
data protection in use

1366
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,400
and i already see that the slides are

1367
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,920
messed up

1368
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,520
okay so

1369
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,640
the first thing here is

1370
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,559
the unique definition claim and there

1371
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,799
were two episodes before this in which

1372
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
we

1373
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,079
in which i described uh some of the

1374
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,640
flaws in the ccc white paper

1375
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,400
and um

1376
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
the claim here basically is that unlike

1377
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,799
the term confidential computing several

1378
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,680
of the terms used in the diagram have

1379
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,160
multiple competing definitions

1380
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,480
and um

1381
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,160
what these terms are i have in the

1382
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,920
diagram but i think a little bit it's

1383
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,799
very hard to hear you

1384
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,960
okay now do you hear me

1385
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,440
bit better

1386
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,839
okay so

1387
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,319
um so the definition in one of the white

1388
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,359
papers

1389
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,599
by confidential computing consortium is

1390
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,839
based on hardware-based profit execution

1391
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,280
environments

1392
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,760
and we see in the figure there at the

1393
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,839
bottom that

1394
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,680
consists of an oval for trusted

1395
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,880
execution environments which is

1396
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
constituting the definition

1397
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,599
and specifically in another white paper

1398
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,000
where confidential computing consortium

1399
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,799
con claims that the definition is unique

1400
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,720
is basically already contradicted where

1401
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,040
they say that it's only the programmable

1402
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,599
region of the hardware-based trusted

1403
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,000
execution environment where

1404
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,720
confidential computing lies so this is

1405
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,079
[Music]

1406
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,480
really a contradiction in itself apart

1407
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,680
from the other things and this really

1408
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,359
falsifies all the claim and the other

1409
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,280
definitions other things that we see in

1410
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,680
the figure uh if you go back please

1411
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,078
peter

1412
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,480
all right um it was a bit hard to hear

1413
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,559
you hear so i advanced slides somewhat

1414
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,839
randomly

1415
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,200
i hope that i hope that was all right

1416
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,480
please

1417
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,400
also also andy who's running the

1418
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,079
stopwatch is indicating to me that your

1419
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
time is actually over

1420
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,079
okay so i'm afraid we can't uh we can't

1421
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,760
continue with this talk we have to move

1422
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,240
over to the next talk sure which

1423
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,839
coincidentally is a talk that i will be

1424
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,160
giving

1425
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,920
and

1426
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,079
and um

1427
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,440
the talk is about real world crypto 2022

1428
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,599
in amsterdam so obviously people here

1429
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,000
seem to be enjoying hybrid conferences

1430
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,200
and in particular they seem to be

1431
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,760
enjoying the in-person part of hybrid

1432
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,040
conferences

1433
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,839
so

1434
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:08,640
i

1435
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,559
am very happy to announce

1436
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,839
that real world crypto 2022 will be

1437
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,839
happening again as a hybrid event most

1438
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,559
importantly with an in-person component

1439
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,400
in amsterdam

1440
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,440
so

1441
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,400
um

1442
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,160
what can i say about real world crypto

1443
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,119
2022 so the registration we're hoping to

1444
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,440
open in late october

1445
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,280
and

1446
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,280
the notification of the speakers is in

1447
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,520
um first of november

1448
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,839
so i'm actually i'm actually expecting

1449
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,280
that the program should be online

1450
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,440
sometime early in november

1451
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,400
for those of you who have been to chess

1452
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,760
2018

1453
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,599
um it's going to be the same venue so

1454
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,040
for the more senior people here it's an

1455
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,440
amazing venue it's a it's an old

1456
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,440
very beautiful building five minute walk

1457
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,599
from the train station

1458
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,359
um there

1459
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,400
might be co-located events so maybe

1460
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,200
don't book your travel quite yet um

1461
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,559
except if you're very flexible in

1462
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,920
traveling to amsterdam by car or

1463
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,200
something then i think it should be safe

1464
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,720
to do this

1465
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,880
um for the first time

1466
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,200
in the history of real world crypto

1467
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,720
there will be an early bird registration

1468
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,880
deadline we kind of need this just to

1469
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,559
make sure that we we know how many

1470
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,040
people are going to be around and

1471
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,960
most likely the early bird registration

1472
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,440
deadline is going to be on december 15th

1473
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,359
and uh finally there's going to be

1474
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,040
student stipends

1475
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,920
so

1476
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,520
um if you're interested in attending but

1477
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
you don't have that much funding um you

1478
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,280
might want to check online and i think

1479
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,599
the deadline is uh

1480
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,280
31st of october or something like that

1481
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,280
and you find it online and while i'm

1482
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,960
mentioning online the website of the

1483
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,200
conference is icr.org rwc.isc.org 2022.

1484
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,319
thank you for your attention

1485
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,960
and

1486
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,640
we will now have a 10 minute break so

1487
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,200
that means until 10 minutes is really

1488
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,079
hard to calculate now um until

1489
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,160
28 past let's say to just refill drinks

1490
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,760
and be back in the room so see you in a

1491
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,760
moment

1492
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,319
you
