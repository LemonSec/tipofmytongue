1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,280
if you want more time then you have to

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,720
drink

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,319
now some people thought they want to

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,400
outsmart us and uh want to play as a

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,519
team

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
we appreciate team sports

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
but as they also time travelers we

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,000
decided they should usually start with

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,480
minus five instead of five minutes so we

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
meet at the middle

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,840
and they start with zero minutes and

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,279
have to drink their way through their

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,279
talk

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
[Music]

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,670
hello

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,719
[Applause]

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
welcome to our encryption to the future

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,280
talk

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,239
i am barney and these are time travelers

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,559
number one number

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,879
four

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
and we will outsmart those people

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
because we can drink

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,640
uh prepare for the next one

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
one two three

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,240
jubilee

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
so

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,799
the goal of our

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
talk is solving the following problem

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,720
in a long time ago when there was still

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
physical conferences

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,000
in bitscript 2018

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240
we found ourselves at this very nice

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,320
city called tel aviv and more

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
specifically found ourselves at this

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,960
very nice bar called hudna

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,360
and at that bar a dilemma arise

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,880
how do we tell

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
the next party people

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,759
where to drink in the next syracuse

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,640
so

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
this was the original group of drinkers

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
at that point at the time myself yes

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
prabhus custom bomb and rafael dosley

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,079
and

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
we needed to pass this information

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,360
forward

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,560
however

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,159
how do we do it

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
let's say public key encryption

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
let's say we we encrypt the message go

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
to tesla basically 19 or gallery club

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
under some public key and then we send

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
this uh the ciphertext forward

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
well

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,760
doesn't work

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
how could we know back then who would be

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,599
drinking at tesla

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
well we could not

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,440
this these parties are chosen at random

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
they are chosen at random by their

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
furthering agencies their bosses their

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
pc supervisors and so on

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,959
whoever got the money to come drink here

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,879
could actually travel here to travel

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
restrictions so we had no way of using

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
public encryption

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
so we thought of a solution at first

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
the next unicorn

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,959
we can build an io based big data cloud

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,239
blockchain

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
defy ai private zk's narc encryption box

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
we built one we have implemented it we

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,640
lost an ico

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,959
and we got four billion dollars but we

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,360
have no proofs but trust me it works

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
now well this is not why we come to this

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
kind of conference right so

79
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,760
then we thought how can we actually

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
solve this

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,720
and christian

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
to the future

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
so we can actually encrypt our beautiful

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
message telling people all the good

85
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
places where to go to

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,959
under

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
the statement

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
that those who come here and drink with

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,519
us

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,560
should be

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,920
able to decrypt jubilee

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,239
so

93
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
when the party people show up

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
and go to tesla

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
they learn

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
a special weakness

97
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
that only

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
true party people in zagreb can learn

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,640
they acquire

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
a vodka of ratsky a part of uh vratsky

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,519
pelinkova

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
beautiful liquor i mean not as good as

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
this one but beautiful liquor

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
and then they become able

105
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
to use their true party witness

106
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,798
to decrypt

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,519
and find out how to go to the actual

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,199
good place

109
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
there's a circular security assumption

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
there but well you know who cares

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,759
so slight transition coming we buy more

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
time

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,759
you have one uh are you doing it

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,440
yeah yeah that's a teaming fart that's a

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
team effort

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
so good news about encryption to the

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
future

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
jivali

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
you can encrypt messages towards a role

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
the role of uh whoever joins the party

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
in the zero crypts

122
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
and then the parties are actually

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
selected to

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,199
join the party can decrypt the messages

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
and uh they are selected in the future

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
without any actual

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,880
previous information

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
however we can only really construct it

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,639
properly

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,880
in a limited case

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,080
where we have the near future encryption

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,720
in the general case

133
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
we go to unicorn land

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
and then well we get uh

135
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
these things that are equivalent to the

136
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
santa claus

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,560
uh but the hope is that we can go back

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
to solid foundations

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
by actually compiling from the easy case

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,240
to the harder case

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,800
jubilee

142
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
so how many ministers you have

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
so five plus what six

144
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,780
okay

145
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,280
[Music]

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,080
i need to i need to expand on this uh on

147
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
this idea though

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
so i go back

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
four time travelers remember we're time

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,199
travelers

151
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,759
so i go back

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,039
encryption but public encryption is so

153
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,560
77 who cares about the stuff anymore all

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
the rage now is time locked puzzles and

155
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
all and then you ask why not use a time

156
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
lock puzzle

157
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
well using a time block puzzle

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,639
would uh would allow the boring police

159
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
to find us

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,479
at the club we were at on saturday night

161
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
and they might shut it down so we we

162
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,600
must only reveal this message to the

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
true party people

164
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,520
we need the proper witnesses

165
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
we need we need people who actually join

166
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
us there we can just like put in a

167
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,680
timelock puzzle that everyone invests

168
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,479
some

169
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,400
some computation time on so that's

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,120
that's again uh why we need encryption

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
to the future

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
then again uh some of you might know my

173
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,479
opinions on the unicorns they are fluffy

174
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,360
but they don't exist so uh yeah

175
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
uh

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
and then back on foundations back on

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,120
foundations

178
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,000
we we have uh

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
we have a long history of good

180
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
foundations in the world i mean this one

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
is what by uh shiseido

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
the one the one here on the left

183
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
so yeah we have good foundations uh for

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,800
your face we have good foundations for

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,560
your ancient religions and for your

186
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
croatian forts as well

187
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
they're all beautiful

188
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,120
and uh

189
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
you know we would like good foundations

190
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,199
for cryptography as well even though

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
these days it's more uh

192
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
flexible what you could call good

193
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
foundations

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
now applications of this thing

195
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,440
is you know have i mentioned so npc

196
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,720
yeah you can apply this to yoso npc

197
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
and uh well you could send all your

198
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
bitcoin to some some future

199
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,919
lottery winner and then again uh yo so

200
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,039
mpc

201
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
and uh

202
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
if you want to send uh you know if

203
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
you're if you're from a place like me

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,879
from brazil that has a crazy genocidal

205
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
maniac president and you want to send a

206
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
message to the next parliament not to

207
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
that crazy genocidal maniac president uh

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
then you then you want to to use

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
encryption to the future

210
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,279
uh or well you have all this uh treasure

211
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
trove of uh

212
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,440
of wise things you have to tell your

213
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,559
kids your grandkids when they turn 18.

214
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
and but well you're drunk right now

215
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,279
because you're forced to drink

216
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
six or seven shots

217
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
to buy time and then you cannot really

218
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
talk to them but you think

219
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,440
i put all these wiseful things into

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
an encryption to the future cipher text

221
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
and then again you also npc come on

222
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
yourself npc is beautiful

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
uh anyway

224
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
i i believe that the biggest application

225
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
of this uh

226
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
i just want to say we just wanted to d

227
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
os the system so that was it

228
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
do we have something much his name

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
no no no we have we got one more minute

230
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,279
and you and you may well be the only

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,360
presenters at a rum session you end up

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
with more time than they started with

233
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,120
making you

234
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,839
true

235
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,680
time travelers

236
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
they

237
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
yeah keep chose keep going i'm sorry

238
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
keep going

239
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
standards recommendation

240
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
send us recommendations from turnheim

241
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
bars looking forward to seeing you all

242
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
of you there next year and then again

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
jubilee

244
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,839
okay

245
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,480
i hope you can hear me evolve um

246
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
it's my slice okay cool

247
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
right right what

248
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
okay okay so apparently i don't have

249
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
really a chance to beat the previous

250
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
speaker this young man has to drink a

251
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,000
shot in the beginning because i think

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
she sent us 50 slides for four minutes

253
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,279
no no no that's that's

254
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,880
all right right let's talk about it okay

255
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,079
so as i said i probably don't have a

256
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,279
chance to be the previous speaker but

257
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,800
let's start slowly really and uh

258
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
all right

259
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,760
so

260
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,120
uh my name is michael volkov i'm at the

261
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
university of edinburgh i'll tell you

262
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
about some of the boring proofs i was

263
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,640
working on last two years my phd

264
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
um

265
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
okay so before i started like in my

266
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
undergrad years my expectations to what

267
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
what does does it mean to be an academic

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,519
was basically boiling down to two points

269
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,880
first of all strong results like you

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
know textbook level results and second

271
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
aesthetic depth which is quite tricky to

272
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
define but i'll just illustrate with the

273
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
pictures which i will not comment on

274
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
because i don't have enough time

275
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
um

276
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,360
all right

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
um okay the funny letters

278
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,040
uh

279
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,399
a broccoli

280
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
this guy shouldn't worry about

281
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
um

282
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
okay so otherwise it seems to me that

283
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,440
life really emits all what is most

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
important most beautiful

285
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
okay that's another note to drink okay

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
so to all the important beautiful events

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
in our life

288
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
cheers

289
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
okay

290
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,440
oh yeah it can be fun at least right so

291
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
if it's not like really intellectually

292
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
became at least fun

293
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,360
so

294
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
these were my expectations what i got

295
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
instead is well you can imagine right

296
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,360
okay i won't come out on this one um

297
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
sometimes i stay late in the office and

298
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
it reminds me of my childhood when i was

299
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
like five years old and you know i was

300
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
coming to my mom's office and i was

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,519
staying there really late it's really

302
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,480
really nice

303
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
uh but most most of all like technically

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
algebraic group model and you also can

305
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
possibility

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
um so these two things are not quite

307
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,800
what i expected life to be

308
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,639
uh but in any case i want to be really

309
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,160
constructive and try to explain both the

310
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
problem with the things at least in my

311
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,639
career

312
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,320
so the main thing with algebraic

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
modeling you see is complexity not any

314
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,480
type of complexity but really like messy

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,360
complexity lots of complexity

316
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
so in agm you have you know adversary

317
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
who takes some elements and returns

318
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,200
linear combination of them and so this

319
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,720
is like a jigsaw puzzle right imagine

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
you have a proof and it kind of fills a

321
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,399
hole with the puzzle and so verification

322
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,480
equation defines this whole so you know

323
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,399
in this case we can be sure that those

324
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,760
three seeing these elements cannot fit a

325
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
hole because well obviously there is

326
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
like a flat side on the right and there

327
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
is no slide on the left and also i took

328
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,079
this to picture some different parts of

329
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,600
the entrance that are not the same type

330
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
of jigsaw puzzles right obviously okay

331
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,240
and in the wild although the puzzle hole

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
is really big and if you have like lots

333
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
of elements you don't really know how to

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,279
fill this hole

335
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
um yeah and so in our paper on agm

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,760
analysis of you know this z cache like

337
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,079
ck snark setup protocol we had a very

338
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,720
similar problem like crs which gets

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
updated over and over and we want to you

340
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
know model all kinds of attacks and

341
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
parties of being honest and dishonest

342
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
and we have like puzzle elements from

343
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,240
here puzzle elements from there and from

344
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,839
update oracle and we have like

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
interactions into two types of work will

346
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
get so messy so you know adjust we can

347
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
manipulate the things in any in any way

348
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
and there are like lots of variables

349
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
it's it's really really bad

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,959
um so after like simplifications

351
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
reductions and so on we kind of get this

352
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
system which is more or less

353
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
understandable so it can be tamed you

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,480
know the complexity but um the proof is

355
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
not pleasant to read and so

356
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
that's not the problem

357
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
um okay you see all right you see the

358
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,199
special thing okay

359
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,120
oh my god

360
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
right okay so the problem with uc is

361
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
basically i mean you know what you see

362
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
is okay uh hopefully so we have like

363
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
this protocol which is supposed to be

364
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
equivalent to functionality in the

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,240
simulator

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,760
aha the main problem with the c you know

367
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
what it's like

368
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
well

369
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
um

370
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,139
[Music]

371
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,199
and uh

372
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
so you see proofs can be oh okay you

373
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
can't see the top slide but basically uc

374
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
bruce for me follow the two categories

375
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,600
chaotic neutral you give all the hybrids

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
like in words and they're reasonably

377
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
good or you're following lawful good

378
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,720
style and you're basically presenting

379
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
the proof as it should be right in the

380
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,040
appendix and then you get uh you know

381
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
fairly robust construction which nobody

382
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
can verify

383
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,279
uh it's actually not less chaotic than

384
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
the previous one so okay how do we deal

385
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
with things being so chaotic program

386
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
verification and being smart

387
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,120
both options are not available to any

388
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
many people and it's highly

389
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
discriminatory i think so instead i

390
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,360
suggest my uc tool

391
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
which should you know help to solve this

392
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,720
kind of issues

393
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
basically the tool is the following one

394
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,680
you have like the game which you which

395
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
you write so that's that's the game

396
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,160
description okay

397
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
and as it proceeds that's a protocol

398
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,040
physique by the way

399
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
and so when it proceeds you see like you

400
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,519
know this blue and red things which are

401
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,880
saying what is different between the two

402
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
games and you know and you kind of you

403
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
move forward you move forward and over

404
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
time you start to realize like what's

405
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
the deal so you cannot really

406
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
distinguish between the two

407
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,399
two consecutive games and in the end you

408
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,920
actually arrive what what's supposed to

409
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,120
be right so they function out in the

410
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,320
scene later

411
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
so the tool is very useful it's not open

412
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
source but you know one like and i will

413
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
make it open source so just come to me

414
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
and talk to me

415
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,240
um yeah going back to agm and concluding

416
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
i tried to solve a gm problem with a

417
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,519
sage tool didn't go well

418
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
uh and i think the only option is to be

419
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,920
smart or persevere

420
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,319
i see

421
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,880
so i think there is no really added

422
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,519
option for agm for now

423
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,880
but if you have any suggestions on how

424
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,000
to solve it that would be happy to

425
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,199
discuss them

426
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,550
thank you

427
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,849
[Applause]

428
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,839
very nice

429
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,440
hello i'm clemens bouvier i'm going to

430
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,600
present the john wall with ankanto and

431
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
leopard with the block cipher memc

432
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
and more particularly for this

433
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
foundation i present the link between

434
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,880
its algebraic degree and the music

435
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,399
but i'm sorry and i know that some of

436
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,680
you are going to be disappointed i'm not

437
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
going to think during this presentation

438
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,680
since i'd be ridiculous

439
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
so

440
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,959
mimsy has been designed in a context of

441
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
emerging resident symmetry cryptography

442
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,480
for which is necessary to minimize the

443
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
number of multiplication performed by

444
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120
the primitive in large final fields

445
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
mimsi is built with blocks of n beats

446
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
and a key k of and bits2 and each rom

447
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
for encryption consists in adding the

448
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
key the run constant and then applying

449
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
the cube function

450
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
thus our aim was to analyze the

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
weaknesses introduced by the simplicity

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
of this structure

453
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,959
and in particular to investigate the

454
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
security of memphis against integral

455
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
attacks

456
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
this is why we'll focus on the analysis

457
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
of the algebraic degree of the

458
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
polynomial representing transformation

459
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,079
after each round

460
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,760
and as we're looking at the algebraic

461
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,599
degree we can omit the key and this

462
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
description and consider it it's part of

463
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,319
the round constant

464
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,160
so last year at asia crypt uh asia seder

465
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
ital already proposed a new bound on the

466
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
algebraic degree of memphis but now we

467
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,520
have found the exact value of the degree

468
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,600
so let me explain how

469
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
for the first round the polynomial is

470
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,280
six cube so

471
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
the algebraic degree is the amine weight

472
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,039
of three i mean two

473
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,559
and for the second round the polynomial

474
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,400
corresponds to the composition of two

475
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
functions of algebraic degree two

476
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,799
but the degree cannot be four because

477
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,400
we'll limit it but in a variable degree

478
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
which is nine and it can now be three

479
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,799
because seven is missing

480
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,160
so it is two which is counterintuitive

481
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,480
so we have got this a plateau and now we

482
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240
can wonder if there are other plateaus

483
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
on the next round and actually there are

484
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
many

485
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
so this is the degree of memsi so we can

486
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,080
recover the plateau that we have just

487
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
observed between the first two round and

488
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
then there is another one between round

489
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,480
three and four and so on

490
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
so our aim was to show that the degree

491
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,039
evolves precisely in this way by looking

492
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,960
at the shape of the exponent appearing

493
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
in the polynomial

494
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,280
so you identify that we are able to

495
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
express the exponent at each room with

496
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
those of the previous run we can in

497
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
particular demonstrate that no exponent

498
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,919
is equal to five or seven mod 8 and

499
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,080
these play a crucial role in explaining

500
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
the algebraic degree of memphis

501
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
then the main part of our work was to

502
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
construct eyewear exponent

503
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
and specs for fuse body cases for which

504
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
approved remains out of reach we've

505
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
performed to find them depending on the

506
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,280
parity of care where care is our luxury

507
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,080
in a lock screen based on sorry

508
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
so for example in the scheme the blue

509
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
room means that we can construct the

510
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,039
exponent that run r with the exponent at

511
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
front r minus seven

512
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
so then it follows that there is a

513
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,320
plateau between norm r and r plus one

514
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,559
when qr is odd and q plus one is even

515
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
then if we compare our result with the

516
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
work at azure grid we can save one or

517
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,200
two rounds for the algebraic degree

518
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
and if we move to the integral attacks

519
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
we can cover few and more and save a

520
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
little bit of computing time for the

521
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
secret key distinguisher

522
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
so now you're probably thinking i'm a

523
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,640
liar because there is no music here but

524
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
actually when searching i would exponent

525
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,480
we look at the sequence qr when some

526
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
particularities and subsequence appear

527
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
and they involve the denominators of

528
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,200
semiconditions of flux three in base two

529
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,799
so for example we have seven that

530
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
correspond to the blue rule of the

531
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,919
previous team

532
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,080
and actually those number also division

533
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
of the octave that gives the

534
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
approximation of perfect fifi music

535
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,039
series

536
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,600
thank you for your attention

537
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,760
uh hello i'm marcie

538
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,919
uh yeah i'm gonna talk about multiple

539
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,280
codes in a split state model

540
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,159
closer to my mouth oh yeah sure

541
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,840
uh so i'm sure we all like woke up one

542
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,159
day and we had the same problem uh we

543
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
wanted to use nmc but the rate was

544
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,280
terrible and that made us sad

545
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
uh last year we finally got the first

546
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,280
construction at a constant rate but the

547
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
constant was one and a half million

548
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,240
which kept us sad

549
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,799
uh but don't worry

550
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,880
we've got your back

551
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,440
uh it's a joint work with

552
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,720
okay the names are kinda covered

553
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
it's a joint oops

554
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
it's a joint work with uh divas bhavna

555
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
silax me me and shruti

556
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
we got the preliminary feedback

557
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
it

558
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,799
went as expected

559
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
it's

560
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,799
incredibly simple construction basically

561
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,679
by passing most of the last six years of

562
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,679
research in nmc

563
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,280
uh using just very simple things

564
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,520
thank you

565
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,159
oh

566
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
so yeah it's incredibly simple

567
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,480
construction and we're proud to present

568
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,159
nmc with raid one and three

569
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,799
thank you

570
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,880
all right hello cryptographers

571
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
um okay so this is not gonna be a funny

572
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,799
talk this is gonna be a serious talk

573
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
in terms of how funny things are this is

574
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,360
pretty low

575
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,400
so i'm here to i'm not here to entertain

576
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,159
you i'm here to give you a problem to

577
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
think about and nerd snipe you

578
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,360
so

579
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,600
the idea is that like the theme is that

580
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,240
i'm a ramp session organizer like peter

581
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,720
and i just opened my hot crp account

582
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,200
because i don't know we use hot crp for

583
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
ramp sessions here and i have received

584
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
like a thousand talks and they're all

585
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
different talks like some are funny some

586
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,159
are singing some are crying some are

587
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,960
doing theater others are like you know

588
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,039
doing about their graduation

589
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,159
and

590
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
i want to present them in a random way i

591
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,400
don't want to put like my subjective

592
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
reality and like influence the way that

593
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,039
people see it i just want to like order

594
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,840
them so take like the list of fan talks

595
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
and permute them and get like a random

596
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,840
permutation out of it

597
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,760
so what i want you to tell me is how to

598
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,400
do that uh the thing is that you're

599
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
gonna tell me okay just use like fisher

600
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,760
gates and you're gonna get it through

601
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,640
shuffle and it's good but i cannot do

602
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,279
that because the only thing i have is

603
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,279
the shuffle box the thing in the middle

604
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,440
so shuffle box is a thing that has been

605
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,320
given to me as a you know like a ram

606
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,200
session organizer and it takes a few

607
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
elements like k elements much smaller

608
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
than the total number of talks it

609
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,640
permutes them and spits them out so my

610
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,120
question is how can i use the box to

611
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,039
perfectly shuffle the list of hand

612
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,600
elements if i can only like shuffle very

613
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
few at a time

614
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,640
so

615
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,039
i'm going to give you one way to do it

616
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,919
um

617
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,840
so i call it the i don't know what i'm

618
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,360
doing uh approach which is i just take a

619
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
few elements i put them in the shuffle

620
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
box spit them out do it again do it

621
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
again do it again i do this randomly a

622
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
hundred times and then what comes out is

623
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
probably pretty good

624
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,320
um

625
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,159
i don't know how good it is i know that

626
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,000
if we do it infinite amount of times

627
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,480
it's gonna be pretty good perfect but i

628
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,400
don't know how good it is

629
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,880
um then there is like a more geometric

630
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,679
approach which is i take the talks i

631
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,840
take the talks i put them in the matrix

632
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
i start shuffling rows i start softening

633
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,640
columns rows columns i do this like i

634
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
don't know 100 times 200 times and then

635
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,120
you know it's probably good enough but

636
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
how good

637
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,200
so

638
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,159
what i would like you to tell me is

639
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,320
what's the best way for me to use the

640
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
shufflebox uh

641
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,200
thing

642
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,760
uh to do a good permutation of these n

643
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,919
elements what's the best algorithm to do

644
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,400
so are there any possibility results can

645
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,360
i do a three shuffle can i not um how

646
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,520
many times do i have to do it i don't

647
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,240
know

648
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
so if you know the answer just let me

649
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,559
know this is my email or find me in the

650
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,039
conference and i can also tell you where

651
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,400
we're going to use it because it's a

652
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,159
pretty fun application thank you

653
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,000
hello everyone i'm absolutely and today

654
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,279
we are going to talk about the cold

655
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,120
start problem for reading research

656
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
papers

657
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,080
so

658
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,919
while reading crypto papers we usually

659
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,159
have a similar schedule of introduction

660
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
prior work preliminaries constructions

661
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,760
proofs and references

662
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,200
not necessarily in this order because

663
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
the if there's a page limit the last two

664
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
change orders

665
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,559
but this is not necessarily the focus of

666
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,559
our talk right now

667
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,080
what you're going to talk about is the

668
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,520
questions that we have while reading

669
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
papers they usually appear at

670
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,520
introduction they

671
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,360
get a bit crowded during construction

672
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
and during proofs we have a lot of

673
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
questions as we already seen in a

674
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
previous talk before

675
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,279
so what we can do in this case is we can

676
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,200
just read the paper in more detail and

677
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,039
try to convince ourselves or we can

678
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,720
contact the authors and wait for their

679
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
answers to get more insight or we can

680
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
also talk with our

681
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
with our colleagues to

682
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
uh basically solve the problems

683
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
uh but all of this takes quite a bit of

684
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,799
time and this is only for a single paper

685
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
when we actually get the references we

686
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
have found more papers and we have an

687
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
exponential blob up in time

688
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,240
to resolve these actual questions

689
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
so once we are not really happy with

690
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
time complexity what we usually do is to

691
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
complete stuff we construct lookup

692
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
tables and make them publicly available

693
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,360
so this is what i exactly want to do for

694
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,039
questions so

695
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,200
i want to propose a public q a for

696
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,799
crypto research papers

697
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,480
so in order to have this

698
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,720
uh we need two ingredients one of them

699
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,520
is a digital companion for each paper

700
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
but luckily we already have this because

701
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
we have a thing called aprint which you

702
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,159
already know

703
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,279
so this is checked out another thing is

704
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,480
we need the questions which is

705
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
used which use texas called iacr forum

706
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
but sadly it has been archived in 2018.

707
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,880
so my idea is to recycle this idea again

708
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,120
to construct a

709
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
more integrated thing to earprints for

710
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,520
asking questions

711
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,880
so this is how an eprint entry looks

712
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,240
like today

713
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,279
we have the authors the title every kind

714
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,600
of metadata that you can think about the

715
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,399
paper we also have the pdf

716
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,640
and what i want to do in addition to

717
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,559
this is to have an ask a question button

718
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
here which will let people to ask public

719
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
questions like this

720
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
and the authors can reply here or anyone

721
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,919
with a valid answer can also reply

722
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,679
this is not particularly a good question

723
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,360
or a good answer but this is just for

724
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,559
demonstration purposes

725
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,720
and what this will cause is that

726
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,559
when someone else tries to read the

727
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,440
paper

728
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,039
they will not catch this call to start

729
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
problem because beforehand someone will

730
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,440
ask the same questions probably and

731
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
authors will not have to reply again and

732
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,480
again to different questions

733
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
or the same questions from different

734
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
people

735
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,799
uh although this may seem quite a simple

736
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,880
addition it would require a lot of

737
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,520
volunteer work for moderation and

738
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,960
maintenance

739
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,279
uh but i think as a community we have a

740
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,760
good shot of solving this problem and i

741
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
believe that there will be many

742
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
motivating people here or

743
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,039
in the community in general

744
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,840
that are willing to contribute to

745
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
for constructing such a

746
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,679
platform

747
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
lastly this is an urgent problem as well

748
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,799
because if you look at the number of

749
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,000
threads over time in the iacr forum uh

750
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,559
the peak number was at 2007 which was

751
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,640
the initial uh

752
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
year of the is

753
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,880
the initial start of the isr

754
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,720
and more importantly if you look at the

755
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,399
previous years there hasn't been much

756
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,679
discussion about the old papers uh

757
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,279
before 2017 2007 at least

758
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,520
what this implies is that

759
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,080
as time passes we lose the potential

760
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,840
accumulated questions and answers on

761
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
papers

762
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
of the current researcher so we have to

763
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,760
do this argentina

764
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,559
this was like a little overview of what

765
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,399
i had in mind for this construction if

766
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,480
you have any kind of comments or if you

767
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,320
want to brainstorm i would be more than

768
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,080
happy to discuss

769
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,760
just feel free to contact me thank you

770
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,399
very much for your attention

771
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,559
i'd like to seize the opportunity

772
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,320
between these talks to comment about

773
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
this one

774
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
it turns out that we're involved in a

775
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,840
rewrite of eprint and all of these

776
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,679
features are possible to include in the

777
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,960
new design

778
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
so i'd be happy to talk about this in

779
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,039
the future

780
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,120
we're ready

781
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,159
foreign

782
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,720
so in this talk um we'd like to

783
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,519
introduce the alpha beta technique

784
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,919
uh this result is the product of a major

785
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,440
collaboration

786
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,399
with all these co-authors

787
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,600
benedict auerbach from ist

788
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,480
benjamin lip from india

789
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,480
christoph sartjohan from fhms

790
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,840
from iub

791
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,320
fabian ising from fhms

792
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,360
dona sliman from hope

793
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,880
noemi glazer

794
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,360
from mpisp and umd

795
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,918
and myself

796
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,559
so intuitively

797
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,559
we construct abe

798
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,120
for bpp that's cca secure under the ddh

799
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,559
over ecs

800
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
using the fo transform

801
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,480
furthermore

802
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,919
in the ggm we formalize hpke

803
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,519
and ibe as well as jpeg

804
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
we use a well-known

805
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,039
kdf and lwe as syntactic sugar to secure

806
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,880
mls

807
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,440
obviously our nizdics require an ot

808
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,880
protocol and our pq secure in the qrom

809
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,120
the rom proof is left is an exercise to

810
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,720
the reader

811
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
uh we have another cis variant that

812
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,440
works for tls in the uc

813
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,200
obviously this implies vdfs and wpat

814
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,159
security for x3dh why

815
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,159
zk

816
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,080
you're left with more time than you

817
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,360
started with not well

818
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,960
hello everybody

819
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,320
oh my presentation is not basically fun

820
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,720
so for that reason basically i just say

821
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
that we introduce new version of grass

822
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,159
it's not for grant basically for people

823
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,919
who love snarks so since this is not fun

824
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,399
so my slides are succinct basically

825
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,840
that's it

826
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,840
yes

827
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,000
so christian is sadly not here anymore

828
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,799
so we have to

829
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,599
move up the controls

830
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,560
kevin can you give christian uh

831
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
speaking right so christian can you

832
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
unmute yourself

833
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,960
hi andy can you hear me

834
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,359
yesterday he was still here today he's

835
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,159
already guts

836
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,879
take it away

837
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,760
thank you

838
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,800
um

839
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,719
so my goal is also to

840
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
leave with more time that i'm starting

841
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,199
with

842
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,359
for this i hope i have some

843
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,560
help

844
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
in zagreb

845
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,879
maybe some of my co-authors for example

846
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,040
two year around maybe he can come up on

847
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
stage and help me with the drinking of

848
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
liquids

849
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,320
uh to get by the way as a newly

850
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,079
appointed professor

851
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,000
at the beautiful denmark and this is

852
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,079
supposed to give him some exposure

853
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,640
so yeah

854
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
you have to be a bit more quiet if you

855
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,079
want to hear the remote speakers i'm

856
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,440
really sorry but we cannot make it

857
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
louder

858
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,280
okay so let me start um so the point of

859
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,920
this tokyo is to update you on our

860
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
third round of the lmc

861
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
and picnic crypto analysis competition

862
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,680
so

863
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,960
please move forward to the next slide

864
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,240
so uh le-mc is a very special

865
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,079
cryptographic

866
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,680
function you can see it as a

867
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
permutation-based cipher or a one-way

868
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
function with very few end gates

869
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,760
and the the big the main use case is

870
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
uh picnic um question can you try to

871
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
speak up i'd like to get your microphone

872
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
louder hold your microphone closer to

873
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,880
your mouth or speak louder okay i can

874
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
try

875
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
hi tigerette

876
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,160
so

877
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,760
i'm seeing the head signature schemes

878
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,839
they had a

879
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,680
big progress in the last in the last

880
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,800
years when we submitted a picnic several

881
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
years back we had signature sizes of 50

882
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
kilobytes or more

883
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,839
now we are down to 10. christian do you

884
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,760
mind me taking over

885
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
it's very hard to hear you so i'll just

886
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,320
uh read all the slides

887
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
so low mc is a

888
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,800
specially designed block cyber with very

889
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,119
few and gates great for hse and npc

890
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,839
um that i designed together with a

891
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,240
christian and a few other co-authors

892
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,160
so picnic is a

893
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,520
is a candidate for the

894
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,599
post quantum competition a great

895
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,839
signature scheme based on mpc in the

896
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,920
head

897
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,320
it's still in the process check it out

898
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,400
it is based on the hardness assumption

899
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
about the security of the lawmaker

900
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,560
design and a very constrained setting

901
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,720
um and uh so i haven't seen the slides

902
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
before sorry for that um so the lmc

903
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
crypto crypto analysis challenge is a

904
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
challenge that is sponsored by microsoft

905
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,560
um with 50 50 000 euro

906
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,119
um and some donation from

907
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,280
let me just check that out yeah

908
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,000
uh iov42 is that right

909
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,119
all right

910
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,480
um

911
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
an attacker only knows a single um

912
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
plaintext ciphertext pair that's a very

913
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,200
specific setting linear kryptonitis and

914
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,599
differential equipment won't work

915
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,599
um so it's for all the symmetric

916
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,480
cryptanalysis out there great setting

917
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,160
um

918
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,920
and uh yeah the different setting that

919
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,000
you can turn out full linear layer

920
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,240
layer

921
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,920
um

922
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,359
and there were the winners of the first

923
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,240
round so let's congratulate them so

924
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,359
that's uh

925
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,880
let's let's see

926
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,040
so it's uh super deep um

927
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,079
that won

928
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,079
four thousand euro congratulations to

929
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,320
them

930
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,280
um and the winners of the second round

931
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,880
are

932
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,320
see above

933
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,880
also four thousand four thousand euros

934
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,680
uh well done

935
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,800
and uh so we have the best uh two round

936
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,119
attack

937
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,200
is uh two to the 88 for security level

938
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,960
128 and the best attack on

939
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,280
ah i can't figure it out you figured out

940
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,359
for for yourselves uh it's four thousand

941
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,680
euro in total um

942
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
there are you can see the cha the

943
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,119
solution on the on this website laurence

944
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,320
challenge github

945
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,079
dot io

946
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,960
and that's the third round so

947
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
as you can tell

948
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,839
with a little bit of arithmetic not all

949
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,640
money was spent so please you know try

950
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
yourselves uh

951
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,400
in breaking those versions up here um

952
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,160
with different prices

953
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,640
um they the

954
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,720
challenges have been set to be not too

955
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,440
hard so hopefully some of those prices

956
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,599
will be grabbed in the future

957
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
check out the website for for more

958
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
information on that

959
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,599
and

960
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,760
oh sorry

961
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,599
so we do have windows of round three i'm

962
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,160
very ill prepared for this talk

963
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,000
all right so we have isaiah who

964
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
presented the kryptonite application of

965
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,119
this

966
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,000
uh

967
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,920
and uh

968
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,800
yeah check out the papers up here and

969
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,320
the summaries and uh

970
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,440
all right yes so we have different

971
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,880
different attacks i did not see the

972
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,440
slides before i'm very sorry for that

973
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,760
oh round four so here we are now so

974
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,119
there is still something left check out

975
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,320
the website

976
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,040
deadline each month is march 13th and um

977
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,720
all right that's it thank you

978
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,680
thank you

979
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,200
so we jumped one talk that will be uh

980
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,599
included in a moment

981
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,000
but so the next one would be the someone

982
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,720
from the ethereum foundation

983
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,160
hi um i'm duncan from lithium foundation

984
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,359
and

985
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,359
i want to

986
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,119
present some new bounties that we're

987
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,400
currently

988
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,240
setting for the

989
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,480
cryptanalysis of some zero knowledge

990
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
friendly hash functions

991
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,960
so the zka friendly hash functions first

992
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
appeared in 2016.

993
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,359
we're using them in numerous

994
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,000
applications for xero noise mainly to

995
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
prove things like set membership or if

996
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,960
you need recursive proofs

997
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,280
now the security is currently

998
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,640
large and unexplored and is based mainly

999
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,200
on algebraic attacks so attacks based on

1000
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
groupnet bases

1001
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,660
and so

1002
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,079
[Music]

1003
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,400
we want to find out a bit more about how

1004
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,520
strong these attacks really are

1005
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,880
the targets are going to be these for

1006
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,160
hash functions memc poseidon rescue

1007
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,880
prime and reinforced concrete one that's

1008
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,599
come up very recently

1009
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,160
and the problem is going to be to

1010
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,319
find a solution to the constraint input

1011
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,040
constraint output problem cico

1012
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,359
the deadline will be the 1st of december

1013
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,000
2022

1014
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,680
and

1015
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,599
there must be a technical report and the

1016
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,319
code must be provided

1017
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,319
and there will be a total of 200k in

1018
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,440
bounties

1019
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,359
and the actual bounties exactly are

1020
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,480
going to fix on november 1st 2021. they

1021
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
will look like this so an example for

1022
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,280
sdu prime we will set different security

1023
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,240
levels

1024
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,119
um

1025
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
the claimed security level based on

1026
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,280
group basis attacks which we believe is

1027
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
a large underestimate and they're

1028
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,720
actually much more secure but you're

1029
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,160
welcome to try

1030
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,400
um the bounties are going to be between

1031
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,240
2 000 and 26 000 per hash function so if

1032
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,400
you're interested in it then please go

1033
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,520
to the website which is

1034
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,319
ckheshbounties.info

1035
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,800
on november 1st the actual final

1036
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,560
bounties with exact parameters are going

1037
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,920
to be published

1038
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,960
and also remember

1039
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,920
challenges.ethereum.org contains lots of

1040
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,440
interesting bounties for different

1041
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
cryptographic and also non-cryptographic

1042
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,560
challenges

1043
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,920
um yep

1044
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,960
so please visit our websites

1045
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,400
i'm gonna get done

1046
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,400
where are the general chairs

1047
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,040
foreign

1048
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,760
hello sorry about the technical issues

1049
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,440
so i'm going to talk about en group

1050
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,880
signatures

1051
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
and this is a new cryptographic

1052
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,520
construction done by french experts and

1053
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,599
it's motivated by real world usage so

1054
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,200
let me talk a little bit about the use

1055
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,240
case

1056
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,160
it's called this

1057
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,119
i'm sure you know what this is uh it's

1058
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,119
used a lot in europe now because it's a

1059
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,200
european kovit certificate

1060
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,640
but what's in this basically some

1061
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,720
identity information health information

1062
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,680
and the cryptographic signature

1063
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,920
so the question is is it really a good

1064
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,359
idea to use this is it making the world

1065
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,480
better basically

1066
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
so this is a very hard question but in

1067
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,119
cryptography we have ways to answer this

1068
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,200
we just use a distinguisher right so

1069
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,119
we're going to compare two worlds so we

1070
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,599
have the world of 2020 where we use the

1071
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,760
paper certificates in order to board the

1072
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
plane you just show the piece of paper

1073
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,160
with your test results and in 2021 now

1074
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,000
we use digital certificates so what is

1075
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,839
the difference well the digital one is

1076
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,359
hard to forge because there's a

1077
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,119
cryptographic signatures

1078
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,480
and both of them are supposed to be

1079
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
verified locally so in terms of privacy

1080
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,839
they both look good

1081
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,079
right so of course it's an improvement

1082
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,000
or or is it really

1083
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,599
well let's look a bit more at the

1084
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,680
security so we have to look at the full

1085
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,440
uh chain of events

1086
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,000
and it starts with a vaccine or a test

1087
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,119
results

1088
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,960
then you go to the health authority and

1089
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,400
they give you a certificate with a

1090
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,079
signature and then you show the

1091
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,560
certificate to a verifier but of course

1092
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,160
we use cryptography to make sure the

1093
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,839
certificate is authentic but there are

1094
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,599
other parts of the chain

1095
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,560
and

1096
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,520
in fact

1097
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,760
the weakest link is probably between the

1098
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,599
vaccine of the pest and the health

1099
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,280
authority

1100
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,119
uh in some countries when you get a

1101
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,839
vaccine you actually get a paper

1102
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,839
receipt and then you give this paper to

1103
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,240
the authority to get your certificate

1104
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,760
so of course this will not be stronger

1105
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
than a paper system

1106
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,079
and when you look at the verification uh

1107
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,319
i've seen many people who are apparently

1108
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,560
able to read the qr code with their eyes

1109
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,640
and to do the signature verification in

1110
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,760
their head

1111
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,240
so either they are much much more smart

1112
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,640
than me or the verification is not done

1113
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,720
properly

1114
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,200
if you look at the privacy side uh it's

1115
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,520
also not very good because in fact it's

1116
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,680
not designed as a privacy preserving

1117
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,599
tool because all the information is

1118
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,599
there in the clear so every every time

1119
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,359
you show the certificate you're showing

1120
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,880
all the information

1121
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,800
so supposedly it will be implemented

1122
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,720
properly and the verification is local

1123
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,800
and they don't keep any information and

1124
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,520
in this case it's mostly okay

1125
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,280
but there's a risk that it's implemented

1126
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,359
badly and then it basically turns into a

1127
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,839
surveillance mechanism

1128
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,520
also if you think about it it was

1129
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
created for border crossing but now it's

1130
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,280
been extended to daily life in many

1131
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,680
countries and in france you need it to

1132
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,000
go to a restaurant or to go to a cinema

1133
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,599
and this means every every time you do

1134
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,920
this you're going to give your name and

1135
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,079
maybe if you're going to a gay bar it's

1136
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,160
not such a great idea to give your name

1137
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,720
when you enter so very many privacy

1138
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,920
issues

1139
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,480
but luckily in france we have a solution

1140
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,040
that's the iron group signature

1141
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,280
so it's a really great use of

1142
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,680
cryptography so it's not really

1143
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
cryptography

1144
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,599
so the the idea so this is in the

1145
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,760
official app that was developed by a

1146
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,839
company called iron group so that's why

1147
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,480
i'm calling it iron group signature

1148
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,960
and what what i managed to do is to do

1149
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,599
an online verification of the signature

1150
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,680
using a trusted party

1151
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,319
so you start from an ec dsa signature

1152
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,559
which is very easy to verify and they

1153
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,400
manage to turn it into an online

1154
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,800
protocol where you have to trust an

1155
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,359
extra party because what the app does is

1156
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,520
it just sends all the data to a central

1157
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,720
server and the server answers yes or no

1158
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,800
and in addition the data goes through

1159
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,760
akamai which is a cdn and so they also

1160
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,839
have access to all the data and all

1161
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,920
those people know who is using their

1162
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,640
pass when they're using it and where

1163
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,319
because they see the ip address so it's

1164
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,880
really a complete privacy nightmare and

1165
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
this is not just a theoretical issue

1166
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,800
like it could go wrong it's something

1167
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,520
that actually happens in france they put

1168
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,040
this in place and it was actually

1169
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,960
deployed so it's been fixed now but this

1170
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,200
was really a system that was deployed so

1171
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,119
if we go back to the big question are we

1172
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,640
making the world better with this type

1173
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,400
of cryptography well

1174
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,720
i think no i think the the digital

1175
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
certificate is not such a great idea

1176
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,960
because there are very strong privacy

1177
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,000
risks

1178
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,599
and in fact what we need is uh a clear

1179
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,520
goal when we put the system in place and

1180
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,040
then we need to be able to evaluate

1181
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,359
whether the goals are reached or not but

1182
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,119
today we don't even know what the system

1183
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,040
is supposed to be for is it to limit the

1184
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,040
spread of the virus is it to incite

1185
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,200
people to vaccinate we don't know and we

1186
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,119
have no measure of success to evaluate

1187
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,440
whether we need to keep them or to stop

1188
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,680
this so to conclude i think we have to

1189
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,280
be careful when you use cryptography

1190
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,040
we're not always making the world a

1191
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,880
better place so we should think about

1192
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,960
this before deploying systems thank you

1193
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,559
yes

1194
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,480
okay uh hi everybody

1195
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,440
i'm not going to give a long boring or

1196
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,400
funny talk i just want to invite

1197
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,040
the majority of uh

1198
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,160
students uh here present at crypts to

1199
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,800
more of this what you are getting here

1200
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,000
so fun meeting new people sliver victor

1201
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,680
maybe khrushchev

1202
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,280
uh lincoln and so on also the seaside

1203
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,839
and all that

1204
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,720
um

1205
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,160
without your supervisor potentially

1206
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,680
and your faculty

1207
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,599
at the summer school

1208
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,119
in chibney

1209
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,839
so some advertisement here

1210
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,640
so it's a summer school that we organize

1211
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,400
on real world crypto so a lot of fun and

1212
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,280
a lot of nice talks both on crypto

1213
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,160
implementations security system security

1214
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,920
and so on so the chance to enjoy the

1215
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,880
beach and also learn something so

1216
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,480
please consider this

1217
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,480
thanks

1218
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,640
okay

1219
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,960
so i'm going also to introduce an event

1220
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,920
it's going to be wcc 2022 i'm

1221
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,559
co-organizing it with go r and alex

1222
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,400
so the call for submission is simple our

1223
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,720
aim is to bring together researchers on

1224
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,280
coding theory and cryptography both on

1225
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,359
the theoretical side and on the applied

1226
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,800
side

1227
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,400
basic information is going to be a

1228
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,240
hybrid conference in the beautiful city

1229
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,920
of frost stock

1230
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,000
you have the dates and we will have some

1231
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,160
in-person work sessions why should you

1232
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,920
care about that

1233
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,839
well the hybrid conference means that if

1234
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,280
you can't make it then it doesn't really

1235
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,359
matter the city of frost talk is by the

1236
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,800
sea which is always nice and it's the

1237
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,280
baltic sea but it's through the sea

1238
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,200
the dates are so good that pkc stole

1239
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,640
them from us

1240
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,319
and we you will get the opportunity to

1241
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,559
work with actual people who are not from

1242
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,160
your city and what's happening here

1243
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,118
okay cheers guys

1244
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,400
the only important things are the url

1245
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,359
and the submission deadline so please

1246
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,520
submit your papers there and join

1247
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,720
whatever is happening here i guess

1248
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,520
i think we miss a speaker

1249
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,720
all right

1250
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,440
that actually brings us to the last talk

1251
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,319
which is four questions about norway

1252
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,559
which will be given by colin boyd

1253
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,319
uh colin are you there and can you

1254
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,400
unmute yourself and

1255
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,280
share your video

1256
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,720
okay i'm i've done that can you oh yes

1257
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,000
okay we can barely barely hear you

1258
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,400
okay is that better

1259
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,079
we can basically not hear you at all

1260
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,920
can you somehow increase the volume on

1261
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,920
your side

1262
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,079
uh

1263
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,280
no

1264
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,680
i hate to tell you the the problem is on

1265
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,078
your side

1266
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,920
no no

1267
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,480
hello

1268
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,160
speaking so we have an idea if we can

1269
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,839
hear you okay i'll keep talking i'll

1270
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,680
keep talking

1271
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,399
can you hear me

1272
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,359
hello

1273
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,839
hello zagreb

1274
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,839
the online participants hear you but the

1275
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,079
audio output into the room has dropped

1276
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,880
for some reason

1277
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,240
all right

1278
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,558
colin as we as we cannot hear you

1279
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,559
like at all

1280
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,720
are you okay with me trying to give you

1281
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,440
a talk

1282
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,559
uh yeah it will be complete okay i see

1283
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,720
so you're already prepared for the talk

1284
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,240
thank you very much

1285
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,079
i have my uh

1286
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,760
yeah

1287
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,319
you got slimmer bits in there okay i'm

1288
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,160
impressed

1289
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,400
and and knowing how much alcohol costs

1290
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,480
in norway i'm even more impressed

1291
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,720
um

1292
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,720
so if you're okay i can try to do a

1293
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,799
powerpoint karaoke here and give you a

1294
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,799
talk i took a quick peek at your slide

1295
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,920
so it's not a complete oblivious

1296
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,359
talk

1297
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,720
should i try

1298
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,559
yeah sure all right

1299
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,799
so

1300
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,079
so

1301
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,799
at the end of this rom sessions there is

1302
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,880
four open questions

1303
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
and those open questions are about

1304
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,440
norway

1305
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,839
so the first question is

1306
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,480
when was the last time that eurocrypt

1307
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,839
took place in norway

1308
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,559
what do you think any guesses

1309
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,520
anybody knows

1310
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,400
93 if bart pernell says 93 i mean he

1311
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,000
should know right let's see if he's

1312
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,319
right he is actually right okay so bart

1313
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,558
now

1314
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
now we'll be playing this game

1315
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,640
next questions go to you directly let's

1316
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,558
see if you get them right all of them

1317
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,559
so

1318
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,720
the next question is

1319
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,960
thousand years ago the capital of norway

1320
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,880
was oslo

1321
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,000
nidaros or trondheim

1322
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,559
so okay so but what is out you you

1323
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,200
solidly say tron time here let's see

1324
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,680
what it is

1325
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,720
so okay i'm sure colin can explain this

1326
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,040
i cannot i've got i'm i'm not but it

1327
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,079
seems to be nidaro's and tron time

1328
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,119
it's the same place

1329
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,839
all right colin we can hear you now can

1330
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,520
you just keep shouting and continue

1331
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,400
sure sure okay okay so uh yes uh the

1332
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,319
trondheim was called nidoras a thousand

1333
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,640
years ago but oslo didn't exist but you

1334
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,240
can see uh you can see a bit of tron

1335
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,240
time here with neither ostomy the

1336
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,760
cathedral in the background

1337
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,960
so let's uh go on

1338
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,240
anybody want to guess

1339
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,680
how long will the night beat on the

1340
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,118
first day of eurocrip next year

1341
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,720
so uh

1342
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,598
it actually turns out

1343
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,559
colin we need your explanation here

1344
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,160
okay so officially officially um

1345
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,000
there is no night so there's only

1346
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,280
twilight in trondheim

1347
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,240
so

1348
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,559
strictly speaking the correct answer is

1349
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,119
uh zero minutes but actually the sun

1350
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,319
goes uh goes behind the uh horizon for

1351
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,640
four hours 27 minutes so we do not have

1352
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,359
midnight sun

1353
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,040
all right

1354
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,119
but if you want midnight sun you can

1355
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,160
just go up to the lofoten islands

1356
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,960
uh for a nice holiday after the uh after

1357
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,680
the conference

1358
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,440
so

1359
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,839
last question is

1360
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,920
colin

1361
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,960
yes

1362
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,480
uh what would you like to do submit a

1363
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,880
paper propose a workshop or perhaps you

1364
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,280
should just start planning

1365
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,799
i guess we know the answer to that one

1366
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,280
probably probably many of you do because

1367
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,960
uh uh i look most of you will know that

1368
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,720
it's too late to submit the paper now we

1369
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,960
have uh several hundred papers under

1370
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,559
under review i believe

1371
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,520
uh

1372
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,760
you can certainly start traveling

1373
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,480
certainly start your travel plans uh

1374
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,960
norway is currently open for business

1375
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,880
and norway is in schengen hope you can

1376
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,760
get a visa to travel uh but my serious

1377
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,480
point about this uh talk is that uh

1378
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,920
we've now opened the proposal for

1379
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,200
workshops

1380
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,720
if you can go to the next uh

1381
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,599
next slide next

1382
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,559
thank you

1383
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,799
uh so the uh

1384
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,359
the uh call for for workshops is now

1385
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,760
open and please go to the website next

1386
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
slide

1387
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,440
uh and we hope to see you uh in

1388
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,200
trondheim

1389
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,760
next year and this is the venue with a

1390
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,839
nice sunset in the background

1391
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,280
thank you

1392
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,260
thank you very much

1393
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,929
[Applause]

1394
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,440
now

1395
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,200
if you carefully check the schedule it

1396
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,559
looks like this is the end of the

1397
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,160
program and this is the end of the rum

1398
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,040
session

1399
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,000
however we still have one task left

1400
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,760
and that is electing the best drum

1401
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,079
session talk remember this was one of

1402
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,599
the achievements that you can have in

1403
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,040
cryptology

1404
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,839
um

1405
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:34,960
so

1406
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,880
there were three talks although it's a

1407
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,880
semi-democratic process here um

1408
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,359
so we make a pre-selection and then you

1409
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,319
get to vote by clapping i need to unlock

1410
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,920
my screen here to see again what the

1411
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,119
pre-selection was one second

1412
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,599
all right so there were three talks that

1413
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,240
in terms of cryptological achievements

1414
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,920
really stuck out

1415
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,720
we believe um and that was the talk

1416
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,799
right after the break by the time

1417
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,000
travelers

1418
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,640
entitled encryption to the future

1419
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,960
this was the talk

1420
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,720
we come to the vote in a moment

1421
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,440
this was the talk right after that talk

1422
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,359
which was open problems in writing

1423
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,240
tedious proofs

1424
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,200
i'm almost feeling like we can stop the

1425
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,480
vote here but

1426
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,070
there was also the alpha beta technique

1427
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,699
[Applause]

1428
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
all right that kind of concludes the

1429
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,640
vote we don't need to go to serious

1430
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,440
voting here um so uh

1431
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,559
phillip and benjamin could you come up

1432
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,799
here and i will see if we still have a

1433
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,640
bottle of schliemer pizza left or if

1434
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,640
it's actually all gone

1435
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,558
um let me see here behind the stage

1436
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,119
it turns out we have one bottle of

1437
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,440
sliver bits left yay great okay so

1438
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,559
congratulations to

1439
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,720
i think two achievements for you first

1440
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,720
run session talk and first best drum

1441
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,000
session talk

1442
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,200
i think for you it wasn't the first

1443
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,440
transition talk i guess no no but maybe

1444
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,920
maybe second achievement okay great

1445
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,880
so

1446
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,119
this officially concludes

1447
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,799
this officially concludes the ram

1448
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,799
