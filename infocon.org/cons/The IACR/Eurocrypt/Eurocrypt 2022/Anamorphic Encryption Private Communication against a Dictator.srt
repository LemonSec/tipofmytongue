1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,560
okay great so uh the next paper is on

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,160
anamorphic encryption private

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,559
communication against a dictator by pino

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,240
persiano duong

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,440
hyun fan and moti young and pino will

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
give the talk

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
thank you thank you for being here

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
almost the last nation okay so this is

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
anamorphic encryption it's worked with

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,240
you fan and moti who is not here

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
okay so let's see how this work

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,320
okay so privacy is a basic human right

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
and okay it's in the

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
united nations declaration of human

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,440
rights

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,160
uh it's very well

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,520
taken as a basic human rights in most

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,719
countries

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,719
and um

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
and cryptography uh we are proud to to

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
have done you know

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
been very successful in providing tools

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
for encrypted so for example just to

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
mention one it's the signal protocol and

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,479
and the app which most of us have on on

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,280
the cell phone which will give us some

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,240
some degree of privacy and communication

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
but

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,400
we observed in this in this paper that

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
the success

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,040
of cryptography and protecting privacy

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
relies on two assumptions

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,080
uh that are very uh you know they are

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
quite obvious we take it we take them

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
from granted but they might be

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
challenged in a dictator

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
dictator in a dictatorship

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
okay so

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
bear with me with for two slides these

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
are quite obvious first of all so

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,880
encryption guarantees

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
privacy of the message only with respect

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
to parties that do not have access to

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,439
the secret key obviously okay this is

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,159
codified in the indica game

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,360
and the assumption is that the receiver

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
the owner of the secret key is able to

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
keep the secret key in a private

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,479
location

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
okay

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
the second

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
observation

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040
with with uh

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,119
an ensuing assumption is that the

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
ciphertext case carries the message that

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
was encrypted not the message that the

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
sender

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
wish to encrypt

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
obviously

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,599
and

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,319
and the assumption is that the sender is

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,400
free to pick the message to be encrypted

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
okay

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
so we have this to assumption that you

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
can keep your key secret and that you

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,160
are free to pick the message to encrypt

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,599
okay so

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
so why is this a problem it's you know

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
most of our results are conditional

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
anyway so maybe

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,239
you know this is a classical theorem

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
from uh from um from a textbook instead

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
of saying you know assume existence or

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
one way functions and then you say oh

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,319
assume a

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
system is a one-way function and

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
receiver privacy then there exists a

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
secure

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,599
symmetric encryption scheme something

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,720
like that

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
so we have to assumption we have one-way

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,959
function we just make it explicit

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,920
ability to hide my key okay

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
the problem is that

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
the two assumptions are quite different

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,360
in nature

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
the first assumption existence of

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,720
one-way function

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,840
derives from our understanding of nature

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,640
and it's something that if true is going

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,959
to be there and it's enforced by nature

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,360
and nobody can do anything about this

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
and if it's false if there are no one

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
will function then there are no one way

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
function for anyone okay

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
the second assumption is that is

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
enforced by political power

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
in the sense it can be changed by law

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
and decree like you know if i became a

100
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,640
dictator i could have a decree and say

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,440
oh it's illegal for you to hide your

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
secret key from me

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,000
okay and then it could and then in this

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
change in this sense it changes but not

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
for everybody just for some of us but

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,720
not for all and especially will create

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,120
an asymmetry between the dictator and

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
the regular citizens

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
so uh so this is the difference between

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
low nature like existence or one-way

111
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
function and uh normative prescriptions

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
okay

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
so

114
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
both assumptions

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,918
are realistic in normal settings i'll

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,720
i'll elaborate a little bit more on this

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
and

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
so no wonder since we live in

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,960
uh in good countries in a sense and uh

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
this you know most of cryptography has

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
been developed under this assumption but

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
this is not always true like in a

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,400
dictatorship there is a very famous kcd

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,199
cartoon which i think most of us know

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
that you know

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
let's say you know this is what we

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
kryptoner's imagination say oh my god

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
it's encrypted with rsa it's gonna take

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
you know millennia to to break and then

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,440
the guy on the right that's okay just

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,759
hit him on that head until he gives you

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,560
uh

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
the secret key and this is what you know

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
that's what we think we are and that's

135
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
on the right that's what we want

136
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
to achieve even if someone is going to

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
hit us on the on the head with the key

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,320
with the with the range then we are not

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
going to surrender the key or if we do

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
that will be useless

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
and uh that's for receiver paris and

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,160
also for sender freedom uh

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
citizens might be invited to send some

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
messages like for example i don't know

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
if you have followed there was a case

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
which is not clear about a tennis player

147
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,199
which sent messages to the president

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
saying that she's fine but it's not

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
clear if that message was

150
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
was uh

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,520
was a real message or was something she

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
was invited to send

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
okay

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
as i said

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,039
the case

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,080
is clear for dictators but also

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
in uh um what are called regular

158
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,039
countries or other countries there has

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,919
been

160
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
an ongoing

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
um thread of activities that tried to

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
regulate limit uh encryption and

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,600
this became more or less evident in in

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
mid 90s uh with the clip the clipper

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
chip initiative by the us

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,600
and uh this go under the name of crypto

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,880
wars there is this war between

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,680
um mostly law enforcement that you know

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,199
they fear that

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,360
uh

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
encryption will give an advantage to the

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
bad guys and they want somehow to limit

173
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,759
and regulate the use of encryption and

174
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,880
in fact

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,199
there have there has been a lot of work

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,960
in the community i just mentioned uh two

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
uh you know the earliest work that i'm

178
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
aware of it's uh by sylvia mccally in 92

179
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
about fair cryptosystem and there is uh

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,280
from last eurocrypt okay uh this work

181
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
about arias

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,199
and they try to use

183
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
um

184
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
cryptographic tools and normative um

185
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,919
normative prescription

186
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,880
to try to you know limit the use but

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,840
under

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
uh the rule of the judiciary

189
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,319
the problem is that in a dictatorship

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,039
there is no independent judiciary system

191
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,599
so there is no one where the police or

192
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,319
the dictator should go and get

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,199
you know

194
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,280
a war and say okay now you are going to

195
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
give me your keys

196
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
and uh

197
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
and it's not clear

198
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,319
that if we

199
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,440
put these

200
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,039
schemes in place

201
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
then maybe the political regime will

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,240
change and then we'll give a very strong

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,479
tool to the dictator

204
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
uh the concept of crypto wars is also

205
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,440
related to cryptography a concept uh

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
invented by

207
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,319
adam yang and monty young and also there

208
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,280
is some

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,520
a very uh

210
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,919
related stream of war comes up vertible

211
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,520
encryption which actually is

212
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,919
tries to address the dual problem that

213
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,520
we're trying to address okay so

214
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
how can we fix this suppose that we want

215
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,720
to

216
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,599
to give tools that can be resistant to

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,479
dictators of course we cannot this is

218
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
what the first observation we cannot

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,639
just come up with the new

220
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,479
scheme because

221
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
then what is the dictator going to do

222
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,319
suppose that i come up okay there is

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,720
this crypto paper and you know dictator

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,919
this crypto paper uh is gives you an

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
encryption scheme which you know even if

226
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
you

227
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,279
try to get a speaker key even if you

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,599
force me we can get around the first

229
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
thing the dictator will do is going to

230
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
make this scheme illegal

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,800
okay

232
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
so

233
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
rather we suggest we should look at

234
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,680
existing scheme existing schemes

235
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
and show that these schemes as they are

236
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
they can be used

237
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,800
as they are or modified in an

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
undetectable way can be used to get

239
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,120
around these two problems

240
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
indeed existing schemes cannot be

241
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
disallowed because they've been already

242
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
uh deployed and there are some

243
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
legitimate use but even if he wants to

244
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
disallow the schemes then we'll make the

245
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
dictator really registered to every euro

246
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,920
crypt and crypto to check what what we

247
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
have been doing and then keep a list of

248
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
what is going to be which is very

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
inconvenient if you are a dictator at

250
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
least that's what we hope

251
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
okay so what is our approach

252
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
let's look at the receiver privacy

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
receiver pricing when you get hit on the

254
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,399
head okay to surrender your team

255
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
so

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
so there are two constraints like the

257
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
dictators has the secret key

258
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,839
and it can decrypt and read the message

259
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,839
but okay this works in our favor

260
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
only messages that are being encrypted

261
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,640
with the key that is given to the

262
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,200
to the to the dictator so our approach

263
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,920
is

264
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,079
to have to dream of something like a

265
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
cipher text is actually associated with

266
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
two keys

267
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,560
and the cipher text carries two messages

268
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
one with respect to each of the two keys

269
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
m0 and m1

270
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
and in a sense there is no second key

271
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,560
in the sense

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,680
that's at least what the dictator thinks

273
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
that there is no second key and that's

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,839
what we can

275
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,880
quite

276
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,600
easily deny the direct list such a game

277
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
i'll just give you an example right now

278
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,800
this example uh also appeared under a

279
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
different name in the literature uh like

280
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,200
for example it's on the word by bellar

281
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
patterson roadway in crypto a few years

282
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
ago and it's for the dual problem for

283
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,279
subvertible encryption and it also

284
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
appeared very recently in the in the on

285
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
this working in innovation telecomputer

286
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
science by horror park riserson and uh

287
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
by kuntana

288
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,680
okay we not okay so

289
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
just take

290
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,079
any encryption scheme okay this is the

291
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
normal mode i don't have to go

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
through the bullets because that's what

293
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
what we have now suppose that alice

294
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,160
wants to send a message you know glory

295
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
to our leader okay but she wants to just

296
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
for the sake of this example just she

297
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
wants also to send

298
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
uh no that's bob bob wants to send one

299
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,040
bit to alice okay

300
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
so how does he do it okay

301
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,519
so alice and bob

302
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,720
share

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,680
the a seed k for a pseudo-random

304
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
function

305
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,000
so when bob sends the message glory to

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
our leader he keeps sampling

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,160
uh cipher text until he gets a cipher

308
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
text that evaluates to be the bits that

309
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
he wants to send

310
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,880
under the shared seat

311
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,399
okay as you can see this

312
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,360
this is going to work because you know

313
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
e

314
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
that's just a regular just think of it

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,040
as a s for example for secret key or you

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,399
know elgamal whatever you know rsa or ap

317
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,519
and

318
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,160
the dictator uh just sees normal

319
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
communication and even if alice

320
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
surrenders the key or the encryption

321
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,839
scheme

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,720
then you know the dictator will say oh

323
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
glory to our leader and if the dictators

324
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
say oh okay no no give me the seed that

325
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
you shared with alice

326
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,160
with bob ellis could say you know

327
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,959
what seed there is no seed okay i'm just

328
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
using as i'm just using rsa or ap

329
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
okay so this is

330
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,160
a feasibility in the sense that what

331
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
we're dreaming of actually actually

332
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,279
exists

333
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,560
and uh

334
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,120
yeah this is a theorem

335
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,120
and of course there are some uh

336
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,800
there are some restrictions you can

337
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
imagine like

338
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
it can be extended to any length you

339
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
just keep sampling but of course this is

340
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
going to be exponential the extended

341
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,760
time is going to be exponential in the

342
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,720
length

343
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
we call um

344
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,200
schemes like this we call it receiver

345
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
anamorphic why because

346
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,519
you know there is a normal mode and

347
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,600
anamorphic mode anamorphic images are

348
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
those that you know give you different

349
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
images depending on the angle on which

350
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
you you look at them

351
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
okay so

352
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,760
so for the dictator it's the normal mode

353
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,120
for alice and bob there is the

354
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
anamorphic mode so we call them receiver

355
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
anamorphic and that will be standard

356
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
anamorphic to address the second problem

357
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
the standard freedom problem

358
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
in fact these are the our two technical

359
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
contributions we're going to give a

360
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
receiver an amount fix for many bits

361
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
polynomial time

362
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
rejection sampling only works for a few

363
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
bits

364
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
and

365
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
we're going to give sender anamorphic

366
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,000
with no shirt key remember that in

367
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
rejection assembling as well in the one

368
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
that we're going to show next uh alice

369
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,199
and bob have to agree on on the seed

370
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,040
okay here instead in central anamorphic

371
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
we are going to do

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,279
we are going to do this completely with

373
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
no prior communication

374
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
and for this we need some extra property

375
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
and we'll see those

376
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,560
okay

377
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
we take the narrow young encryption

378
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,880
scheme this is an encryption scheme

379
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,399
uh that uh provides cca security cca1

380
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
cc2 depending on the strength of the

381
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
needs and will not go into this detail

382
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
but this is the slide

383
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
uh that describes now or young i think

384
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,639
that most of us uh you know they keep it

385
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,720
in mind but they have it in mind but you

386
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
know just for uh to refresh there are

387
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,560
two public keys but there is only one

388
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,959
secret key okay

389
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,160
and actually this is crucial in the in

390
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
the proof of security so if you want to

391
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,880
encrypt a message like a glory to our

392
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,279
leader so you what do you do you encrypt

393
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,800
it with the first public key you encrypt

394
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
it with the second public key then you

395
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
produce a proof that the two are

396
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
consistent and then you send it upon

397
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,199
decryption you know upon arrival the

398
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,600
ciphertext alice checks the proof and

399
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,160
then it decrypts the first one

400
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,120
alice has no second decryption key

401
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
actually you know for example for

402
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
elgamal you can sample a public key

403
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,000
without having the corresponding secret

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,360
key but

405
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
okay so this is the normal mode what is

406
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
the

407
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
i'm sure that now it comes you know most

408
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,839
of you got it already because what is

409
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,759
the anamorphic the anamorphic is the

410
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,079
following like okay

411
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,880
alice actually keeps both secret keys

412
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,759
okay

413
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,839
and now

414
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,240
when uh bob wants to send a message he

415
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
stands on the first secretary of the

416
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
official secretary you know glory to our

417
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,560
leader and then he says

418
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,800
you know fine to our leader you know

419
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
just

420
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
find our leader for illegal parking

421
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,560
maybe that i don't know what they mean

422
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,519
okay

423
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,079
and the secret the secret shared

424
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,800
information is the simulators trapdoor

425
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,680
okay

426
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
so instead of uh having a sigma a a

427
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
truly random string

428
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,839
or you know a string from uh the right

429
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,519
distribution depending on the underline

430
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,639
needs so what they do alice runs the

431
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
simulator gets a string which is

432
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
indistinguishable from what it should be

433
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,079
and gets a trapdoor

434
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,399
alice and bob shared the trapdoor

435
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,639
that allows bob to produce a nisk a fake

436
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
needs a cheating needs that the two

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
messages are equal okay

438
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
so now when the dictator knocks on ellis

439
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
door though you know said okay yes i

440
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
have sk0 that's all you know that's what

441
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,079
now jung told me to do okay and that's

442
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,120
it

443
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
and the detector

444
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,440
the clips and say oh go go towards oh

445
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
these are good kids okay

446
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,480
and um while alice

447
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,839
has also sk1 and the crypts and eclipse

448
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,600
the real message okay

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
let's find

450
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,919
our leader okay

451
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,959
now you can see that

452
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,319
um

453
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,640
okay why does this work okay the

454
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,799
properties of knees different flavors of

455
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,199
knees that you want to do simulation so

456
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
depending on the but this implies that

457
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
anamorphic and normal public keys are

458
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,039
indistinguishable

459
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,079
uh nic plus in cpa imply that the cipher

460
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
texts are indistinguishable so the fact

461
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,760
that they are not the same ciphertext

462
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
but they are

463
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
of course this is hidden

464
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,080
and uh this is what i said pk1 could be

465
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
generated without a specific

466
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
uh secret key so alice could you know

467
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
say oh no i'm just following the

468
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
protocol i'm just

469
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
you know following the word also on the

470
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,960
paper and i have no sk1

471
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
okay

472
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
okay and the other line the pk0 pk1

473
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
sigma now subs is the trapdoor is

474
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
can be proved to be a symmetric

475
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
encryption case all the proofs are in

476
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
the paper the paper is only print

477
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,320
and uh in the proceedings so but i'm not

478
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,200
getting into proofs now

479
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,559
okay so let's come to the to the final

480
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,320
the sender

481
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
freedom assumption

482
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,640
uh here we are assuming this assam is

483
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,880
from the sender is free

484
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,799
to pick the message

485
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
which you can you know you can be fought

486
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,280
like you have a a gun at your head and

487
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,039
then you say okay just send the message

488
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
that everything is fine

489
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
okay that you're free to move and then

490
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
you you know nobody should worry about

491
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
that

492
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
okay so this is the story of oscar and

493
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
john

494
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
oscar is a political opposition leader

495
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
okay

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
and then at one point there are you know

497
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
oh this opposition leader is being

498
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,840
persecuted by the dictator the dictator

499
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,320
wants to look good to the to the world

500
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,120
public opinion so it just goes towards

501
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
can say hey oscar why don't you send a

502
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
message i'm fine and in good health okay

503
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,919
so what can you do with the to a fourth

504
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,720
public key fpk fpk could be you know

505
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,440
like the public key of some media outlet

506
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
you know bloomberg

507
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
you know ryuno or whatever

508
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
cnn

509
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,080
oscar who wants also to send a message

510
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,720
hey i'm in prison and he wants to send a

511
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,360
message to his friend or to a journalist

512
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
not necessarily his friend called john

513
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,679
okay

514
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,160
and john has you know is publicly dpk

515
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
the public is up there it's well known

516
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
to everybody it's it's on the on the

517
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,360
website

518
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,559
and oscar and john have not talked

519
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
beforehand he just says okay

520
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,440
oh there is this guy that seems to

521
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,799
to look good okay and john so oscar

522
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,760
computes oxford oscar does the following

523
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
he computes some special coin tosses r

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
star

525
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
such that

526
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
the ciphertext ct

527
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,559
encrypts the message m0 that's like

528
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
dictator picked message

529
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
saying oh i'm fine i'm in good health

530
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,200
and it's sent to the first public key so

531
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,039
that you know the official media outlet

532
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,640
gets this message

533
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
our star

534
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
but it also holds that

535
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,120
if

536
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
john tries to decrypt the same

537
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,400
ciphertext but with this secret key then

538
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
he gets m1

539
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
so this is again anamorphic depending on

540
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,559
uh under which angle you look at the

541
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,240
ciphertext

542
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,559
and you know depending on which secret

543
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
key you're going to use to decrypt you

544
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
get two different messages but it's one

545
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,360
ciphertext and of course john knows that

546
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,600
his key might be used

547
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,880
to uh to receive some uh some messages

548
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
from opposition leaders and then it

549
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
decrypts also messages that he sees

550
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,039
broadcast on the network okay

551
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,520
and i want to stress

552
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,080
that there is no prior shared

553
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
knowledge between oscar and john okay

554
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
they don't tell you you know this is

555
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
different from uh now or jung and

556
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,559
rejection sampling

557
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,760
okay can we achieve this

558
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,600
oh of course like

559
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
uh

560
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,760
uh

561
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
our star

562
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
is going to be chosen by oscar because

563
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,080
if the dictator picks the randomness and

564
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
the message of course there is no no

565
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
room to maneuver of course you know then

566
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
it becomes a deterministic function and

567
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520
there is nothing we can do

568
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
okay

569
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
so uh before you know giving you the

570
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
result i want to uh just elaborate about

571
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
send an anamorphic and deniable

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
encryption first of all if you remember

573
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,360
the denial encryption from 97 the

574
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
connecti

575
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,159
kinetic paper um that that applies to

576
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,360
the same

577
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
public key

578
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
okay

579
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,880
and

580
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,679
and this is it's it's impossible uh for

581
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,080
standard encryption okay which

582
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,960
contradicts one of our main objectives

583
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
as opposing sender anamorphic can be

584
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,799
used to provide some form of reliability

585
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,720
but this is in a different context now

586
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,440
the context is messages being broadcast

587
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
on the network while

588
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,400
uh

589
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,080
deniable encryption was for

590
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,559
point-to-point communication which in a

591
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,360
sense

592
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
uh justifies their assumption of being

593
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
denial with the same public key

594
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,000
okay

595
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
so these are sufficient conditions for

596
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,640
standard anamorphic

597
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,480
with no shared key

598
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
okay so we have these three conditions

599
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
which are uh

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,440
quite uh

601
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,600
quite reasonable first of all we have

602
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
this property common randomness property

603
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,960
like

604
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
for any uh

605
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,080
cipher text and any other public key pk

606
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,760
prime or

607
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
revert x3 is the valid ciphertext also

608
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
under pk prime

609
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
the second

610
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
property is message recovery from

611
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,919
randomness that if they give you

612
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
ciphertext and the randomness that has

613
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
been used then you can recover the

614
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
message and the third is equal

615
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,679
distribution of plaintext

616
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,760
meaning that

617
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,200
um

618
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,760
for any given c and for randomly

619
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,600
generated sk the probability that c

620
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,039
is uh

621
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
an encryption of zero or an encryption

622
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
one is more or less the same

623
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
okay

624
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
so under this we prove that these three

625
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,520
conditions are sufficient for what we

626
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
want to achieve and then we go on and

627
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,320
prove but uh details are in the in the

628
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
paper but and i'm not going to discuss

629
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
this that

630
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,559
are two very well-known uh encryption

631
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,880
schemes based on lwe uh regav from 205

632
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,440
and the gentry pi cut v node from 208

633
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
they satisfy this three condition and

634
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,840
thus they can be used

635
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,000
um standard anamorphic encryption

636
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
schemes

637
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
okay

638
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
so

639
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,520
um

640
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,919
now to the last slide

641
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,760
and

642
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
okay so i'm doing pretty well on time i

643
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
guess yep

644
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,679
we started a little bit earlier but

645
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
uh okay so these are the conclusions so

646
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,840
we introduced uh two new concepts

647
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,159
receiver analytics center anamorphic so

648
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,799
the receiver anamorphic is useful in in

649
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,960
settings where the receiver

650
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
of a communication is under the

651
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
dictator's control while the sender

652
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
anamorphic is when

653
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
at the center of the message is under

654
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
the dictator's control okay

655
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
we show implementations of these two

656
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
concepts with existing

657
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
uh

658
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
cryptosystems from the literature okay

659
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,799
so that we you know i don't know if

660
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,640
anybody is using in our uni right now

661
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
but you know in principle you you could

662
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,520
use it and

663
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
and that's the

664
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
i think that we think the most important

665
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,559
point of our uh

666
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,840
of our work is that we give technical

667
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,960
evidence

668
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
that this the futility the stupidity of

669
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
the crypto wars like encryption is the

670
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,559
technology that is there and there is no

671
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,799
point in trying to regulate to make it

672
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,120
weaker or to have a control state

673
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,799
control on that like

674
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,880
encryption is staying is there and then

675
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
if you try to do something there is

676
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,480
something you know we have a way to go

677
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
around whatever the dictator all the

678
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,960
good government does uh for

679
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
your own uh good

680
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,720
and uh

681
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,159
and if uh

682
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,320
the dictator really wants to pursue this

683
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,799
at least he'd like to register to our

684
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,400
crypto in europe if it can read all the

685
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,760
proceedings his kids should get a phd in

686
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,919
crypto and okay

687
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,559
and that could be also a good

688
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,000
a good result how

689
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,039
and so uh how how this is going to

690
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,240
affect policy law and other societal

691
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,440
aspects of course this is beyond uh

692
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
you know our expertise it's not in our

693
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,159
park this is not the right forum but

694
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,320
it's just a technical contribution like

695
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,600
you know uh none of the three of us is

696
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,320
uh is a social scientist

697
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
that i know and uh

698
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,360
so

699
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,480
of course but i think that uh

700
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
it's important to

701
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
to say that you know encryption is here

702
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,200
to stay

703
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,360
it's like you know when fast cars were

704
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,919
introduced like i don't know if back

705
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,400
then you know the police complain oh now

706
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
they have fast cars and instead of

707
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
horses and you know in the horses you

708
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
know you could you know just

709
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
go there and then now with fast cars so

710
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
who knows they're going to rob a bank

711
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
and then let's pass a loop by which no

712
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,279
car can be faster than the police car

713
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,679
which you know now you know said like

714
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,000
that is completely

715
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,799
you know very silly and and that's in a

716
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,080
sense what they're trying to do with

717
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
encryption okay

718
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,679
also um

719
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
the last bullet is that anamorphic

720
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
encryption is not a bizarre phenomenon

721
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,200
like uh we have seen it in some very

722
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,919
well known and studied uh crypto system

723
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
there is nothing pathological in our

724
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,240
constructions and you know there is more

725
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
to come there is work in progress and we

726
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,919
would like

727
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,320
to see uh you know more

728
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
uh

729
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,360
non-cryptosystem to be proved to be

730
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
anamorphic

731
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,039
and just to complete the whole program

732
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,039
of showing the futility of the crypto

733
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,000
wars

734
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,960
and

735
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
this is what i wanted to say thank you

736
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
for your attention thank you for being

737
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,439
here in the last session

738
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,039
okay questions

739
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,559
yeah maybe you can use one of them

740
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,200
you can use this one

741
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
um thanks for the great talk

742
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
uh so on the technical level it seems

743
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,159
that to achieve receiver anamorphic

744
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
encryption or even the sender anamorphic

745
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
encryption you need to share some

746
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
information between the parties so in

747
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
particular for the receiver case you

748
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,640
need to share the trapdoor for the music

749
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
and for the sender you need to share the

750
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
randomness right no no no no

751
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
okay uh but at least for the receiver

752
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,559
inclusion

753
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,600
so um how do you assume that do you

754
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,520
assume like an underlying anamorphic key

755
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,279
exchange or a key transport protocol

756
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,039
that does it okay

757
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,720
that's a good question okay first of all

758
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,559
i want to make sure

759
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,840
maybe i i was not

760
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
i didn't say uh

761
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,399
clearly here i don't know it's not this

762
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,639
one

763
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
okay so

764
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
okay so i i cannot find the job so for

765
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
central automotive there is no shell

766
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,399
communication like the sender by himself

767
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,000
by himself picks a special r star but

768
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
there is no way there is no need to

769
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,960
agree on the arsara beforehand with the

770
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
with with the receiver

771
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,520
uh

772
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,480
for uh how do you get

773
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,520
a do a right receiver how do you agree

774
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
on on the speed of the pseudorandom

775
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,080
function or on on the chapter of the

776
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,600
random okay so

777
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
uh so we think uh the setting that we

778
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,360
had in mind is that this is a group of

779
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,200
opposition leaders uh opposition uh

780
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
activists and that they they get

781
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
together at one point and they just

782
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
share

783
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,320
the

784
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,279
uh the the you know this information

785
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,360
i must say that the paper of horrell

786
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,799
atal does exactly what you what you

787
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,880
what to describe in the sense that they

788
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
have some sort of stegonag stegona

789
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,679
graphic um

790
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,279
key exchange okay but you know i you

791
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,880
have to see maybe in different settings

792
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
things have different uh

793
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,440
weights but then uh first of all you

794
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,880
have to start a secret sharing a a key

795
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,360
sharing protocol which might attract

796
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,440
some stuff you know some suspicion from

797
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,360
the dictator and also uh it's very low

798
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,120
rate they so they takes long time to uh

799
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,520
to agree on the key and so post hours so

800
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,679
we have this concept in the paper about

801
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,080
latency hours has zero latency the

802
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,600
moment you have the two keys then you

803
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,880
can start

804
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
but you know these are uh very good

805
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,360
questions thank you

806
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,679
so thanks for the interesting talk uh

807
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
my question uh is about the

808
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,760
non-interactive generality proof that uh

809
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,960
the uh dictator verifies uh

810
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,320
so uh is it uh only specific kind of

811
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,880
non-interactive generality uh techniques

812
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,279
can be uh used in another encryption

813
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,600
schemes or any uh

814
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,519
schemes can be used no

815
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,799
no any needs cur then okay of course you

816
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,960
should get you know if you want cca2 you

817
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,480
want simulation sound unless you know

818
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
that but any knees

819
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,559
will work it's it's genetic in that

820
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,279
respect any needs for which there is a

821
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,600
simulator okay so it has to be zero

822
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
knowledge

823
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
thank you thank you

824
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,880
you know great uh

825
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,519
i

826
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,039
love this name i'm not sure if i love

827
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,960
this name exactly it's very catchy it's

828
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
kind of cool um i'm not sure if you're

829
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,039
aware uh in the mid 90s there was

830
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,039
another paper called plausible

831
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,080
deniability which took the same tack uh

832
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,000
which is kind of looking at a crypto

833
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,840
system and finding ways to use it in a

834
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,039
deniable

835
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,399
uh method

836
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,039
kind of like cdno postdated cdno but the

837
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,440
idea was to say let's use this in a way

838
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,200
that people are not expecting it to be

839
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
used so there's there's one aspect of

840
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
this it was about the wheat about the

841
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
time that wheat and chaff came out it

842
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
was published in progress i'm wondering

843
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,600
what the difference is there might be it

844
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,159
also is using sort of a trapdoor thing

845
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,960
yeah yeah and the other half of it too

846
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,799
is uh the other question which is maybe

847
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,559
a more uncomfortable question which is

848
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,399
how do these things really

849
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,880
resist sort of the screwdriver attack

850
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
which is the the dictator just comes and

851
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,799
says what is your alternative key what

852
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,080
is your alternative key what is your

853
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
alternative key and applies a

854
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,519
screwdriver every single time until you

855
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,320
actually give it up okay okay yeah okay

856
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
you know two good points about the

857
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,679
second one

858
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,799
yeah but the uh if the dictators does

859
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,679
that he could really you know

860
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,919
very well get into someone who is

861
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,039
innocent and doesn't have a key so

862
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,519
and it's going to create a cl you know

863
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,600
terror in the population which is

864
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,080
something that he might enjoy by the way

865
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,120
so

866
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
so i'm not saying that you know this is

867
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,799
going to solve all the problems but at

868
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,279
least there is reasonable doubt that you

869
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,159
know i'm just using as there is no

870
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,000
speed okay

871
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,840
leave me alone so but that's about the

872
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
first one maybe we should talk because

873
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
uh uh maybe we missed we you know there

874
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
are several references and we do compile

875
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,240
so maybe we we take it offline we'll

876
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,159
take it outside and we discuss it thanks

877
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,799
peter okay i got a screwdriver

878
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,440
okay okay

879
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,080
uh thanks so much for this talk it's

880
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,919
really really interesting um one thing

881
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,440
that occurred to me uh while listening

882
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,919
to your talk is that um dictators do

883
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,760
show up at eurocrypt in crypto um we

884
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,519
know with a lot of certainty there's

885
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,440
records from the nsa during the snowden

886
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
leaks that they come to eurocrypt and

887
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,440
we're like hey they're not working on

888
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,880
anything interesting don't worry about

889
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,039
it keep going um and certainly encompass

890
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,799
in the u.s there's always a dod person

891
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,880
who shows up in the back of the room um

892
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,799
and so in light of that i'm wondering uh

893
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,399
to what extent you've been able to

894
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,320
characterize the necessary conditions

895
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
for these kinds of uh communication

896
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
protocols anamorphic encryption like do

897
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
we know that if we don't use anything if

898
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
the government says no lwe ever we're

899
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,440
done with lwe um can we not do anymore

900
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
encryption is there some kind of like

901
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,640
minimum entropy in a channel that we

902
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,320
need uh similar to like steganographic

903
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,760
techniques or is that kind of like an

904
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,200
open question that's that's we want to

905
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,120
look at next yeah yeah no no right

906
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,719
terrific questions these are all

907
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,399
questions for from

908
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,359
uh

909
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,239
next work and uh these are uh great no

910
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,159
no i don't know

911
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,239
i'm looking at back rows maybe they

912
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,520
don't come to europe don't know okay

913
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,040
it's hard to get visa or something right

914
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,760
okay okay okay so we'll see in 15 years

915
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
so you know when the real estate thank

916
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
you thank you

917
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,679
so i have a quick question so sure what

918
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,440
is the connection to steganography

919
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
stegography also says that you can take

920
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,639
basically any randomized encryption and

921
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,239
by playing with the randomness you can

922
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
encode arbitrary messages in the

923
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
ciphertext so what is the connection

924
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,960
yeah in a sense like like if the

925
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
yes steganography

926
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
the dictator could get in and say okay

927
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,918
you're using steganography show me

928
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,399
uh this and also

929
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,918
um

930
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,040
with steganography on the receiver side

931
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
it could have you know you could

932
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,800
get the key

933
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,640
and the sender

934
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,720
from the sender anamorphic we have this

935
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,359
property where you can send it to any

936
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,839
other secret a public key

937
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
which for which you had to know while

938
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,680
steganography you cannot do that like

939
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,760
psychonautics point to point so there

940
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,480
are some differences which but i agree

941
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
it's it's very common

942
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,320
uh

943
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
they're very close as concept but you

944
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
know our emphasis on his own existing

945
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,680
scheme it's not on designing new schemes

946
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,079
okay so we are anyway out of time so

947
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,440
this is the end of the session let's

948
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,560
thank both the speakers again

949
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,880
bye
