1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,839
so

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,680
third talk of this session will be on

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,599
non-valuable commitments against quantum

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,679
attacks uh worked by neil bitansky

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,000
rachel lin and omri shmueli who will

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,199
give the talk please uh thank you

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,160
christian

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,359
hi everyone so um as said uh i would

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,880
like to tell you about non-marble

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,439
commitments against quantum attacks

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
so um the basis for this talk let's

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
start with commitments so a commitment

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
scheme is a protocol between two

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
classical polynomial time algorithms

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,200
a sender who wants to commit to a

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,440
message and a receiver who gets this

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,559
commitment and they interact and at the

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
end the receiver gets this commitment

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
and after the interaction uh the sender

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
can reveal the value and decommit to

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,239
this unique value and sending a message

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
and the commitment and the receiver can

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,840
decide to accept or reject this

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,039
uh um okay in terms of security

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,440
uh we have binding uh which is going to

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,760
say that uh the commitment is indeed

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
committing uh specifically statistical

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
binding is going to say that any

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
unbounded sender that interacts with

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
this uh efficient receiver at the end

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
there is at most a single message that

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
the sender can decommit to

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
and um another security property is the

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
hiding it's going to say

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
that um any quantum computational hiding

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,600
is going to say

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,439
that the receiver doesn't learn anything

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,920
from the interaction unless the uh the

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,240
message was revealed

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,799
formally we can look at the quantum view

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,799
of the receiver at the end of for any

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,439
pair of messages and the view for m1 and

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,920
the view form m0 and it's going to be

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
computationally indistinguishable

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,079
um okay so this this was the the most

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,520
basic and standard definition of

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
commitment schemes and it doesn't

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,079
protect us from one of the most

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
fundamental and basic attacks in

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
both applied and theoretical

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,360
cryptography which is men in the middle

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
attacks

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
so a man in the middle attack is some

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
efficient algorithm at the middle it is

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
going to try to disrupt

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
this uh conversation between the two

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
parties

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,400
and make um

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
the receiver get a commitment to a

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,760
different message even though it doesn't

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
know what the message is

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
on the left side because of the hiding

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
it is still going to be able to to like

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,239
mow it under the commitment

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
um and accordingly we have non-malleable

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
commitment which are commitment scheme

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
that are secure against this men in the

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,319
middle attacks um

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,800
intuitively not entirely formally is

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
that

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
the message that the receiver is going

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
to get on the right is going to be one

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
of two extremes it is either the the man

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
in the middle is transparent

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
which means that it doesn't do anything

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
and the receiver gets m

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
or it is going to be completely

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
independent of what happens on the left

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
it can just block all the messages of

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,480
the sender and

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,360
commit to some zero or something

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,920
and um

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
non-marble commitments are very like uh

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,319
active and uh um field in cryptography

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
they have a lot of uses in other central

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
cryptographic objects they also have

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
like specialized techniques for other

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,879
non-malleable objects in crypto like

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
non-marble codes extractors timelock

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
puzzles and and others so they are

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,319
interesting in like they have uses and

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,360
also

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
special techniques that are relevant for

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
non-marble cryptography

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
and accordingly they these these kind of

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,959
objects were heavily studied by like

97
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
tens of folks

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,920
however uh which brings us to the the

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,080
subject of this talk is that all of the

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,159
previous transactions are not known to

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
be secured against general quantum men

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
in the middle adversaries

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
um and we today want to talk about post

104
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,319
quantum memorability which means that

105
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,720
the attack in the middle is going to be

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
by quantum polynomial time adverse so

107
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
it's going to do to try to do exactly

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,519
the same

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,840
and uh to be a bit more formal about

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
this independency of m

111
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
e m

112
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,519
so um the formal definition

113
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,199
the almost formal definition of

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,238
non-marble commitments is that

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
we're going to have uh

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,759
for the honest part it's still going to

117
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
be classical so the sender and the ceo

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
both classical parties

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
they have a joint input which is a tag

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
this is not a crs or something like one

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
of them can just pick it it can be the

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
sender who picks it or the receiver

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
picks this tag and at the end of this

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
interaction they they have a commitment

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
and the

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
men in the middle attack game is as

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,919
follows

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,080
if before the men in the middle try to

129
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,800
like

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
change the value of the commitment under

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
the commitment without seeing what's

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,919
inside

133
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,400
now it is going to try to commit to the

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
same value

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
but with a different tag

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
so it's going to gain a commitment on

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,479
the left with respect to some tag tg

138
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,880
that he is going to to pick he's going

139
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
to get this commitment from the honest

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
sender

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,199
and on the right is going to commit he's

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
going to pick a different tag tg tilde

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,880
is going to try to commit but to the

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
same message

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,280
now

146
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
it is a known fact in crypto that this

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,720
definition

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,759
is equivalent to the before two extremes

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,280
kind of definition

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
and um we're going to focus on this game

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
like the the full definition is a bit

152
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,360
more general but this like kind of game

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
is going to capture everything we want

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
for this talk

155
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
so the only um um

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
single walk on post quantum non-marble

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,520
commitments is by a aggarwal batu se

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,080
goyal quran and malavolta

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,320
which shows that if we assume the super

160
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
the slight pollen polynomial hardness of

161
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
lwe we have post quantum normal

162
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
non-malabar commitments but they are

163
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
secure only against synchronizing

164
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
adversaries this protocol also is

165
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
constant rounds and synchronizing

166
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,240
adversary is like a very specific kind

167
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
of man-in-the-middle attack

168
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
um which brings us to our results

169
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
our main theorem is that if we have

170
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
post-quantum epsilon extractable

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
commitments we are going to define them

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,240
in a bit

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
and with k rounds we uh con construct

174
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
post quantum non-valuable commitments

175
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,080
having a number of rounds which is k to

176
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,240
the c for some constant c

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
times the log star lambda the security

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
parameter

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
and if we combine this main theorem with

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
previous work by chia chang lian and

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
yamakawa

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
uh they show how you can construct from

183
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,560
post quantum one-way function constant

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,479
round epsilon extractable commitment

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
quantum extractable commitments and when

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,639
we combine them we get the main like

187
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,880
corollary or main result is that if we

188
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
assume post quantum one way functions

189
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,280
we have uh post quantum non-marble

190
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,919
commitments in lobster rounds

191
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,639
okay so let's break down and like uh

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,680
concentrate on the like main technical

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
um lemma for today um this is our main

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
theorem and uh we can forget about this

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
uh epsilon extractable commitments and

196
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
this is a slightly weaker

197
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,160
um statement which will suffice for

198
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,199
today

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,080
and uh this statement is broken down

200
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
like by these two lemmas we prove it the

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
first is the construction

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,039
we show that if we have a post quantum

203
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
extractable commitment

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
um having k rounds we can construct post

205
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,680
quantum non-marble commitments also for

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,560
a number of constant tags and k to the c

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,919
rounds

208
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
and the other one is tag amplifications

209
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
we said that the tag

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,479
can be anything any string any lambda

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
bit string so we should have

212
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
exponentially many tags

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
so the other lemma is just amplifying

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
the number of tags and having uh a bit

215
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,840
of a round over

216
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,400
overhead and this uses

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,319
a bit of modification of previous work

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
which is why today we're going to focus

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
on the main lemma the construction

220
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
okay so let's let's get a bit of

221
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,440
intuition of why non-malleability is

222
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
like less trivial when we want to to

223
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
prove security against the quantum and

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,479
in the middle

225
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,800
um

226
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,479
which to understand this difficulty

227
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
let's first define extractable

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,280
commitments so this again is a

229
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
commitment scheme it's going to have one

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
more um very important property

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
this is quantum extractable so is a

232
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
polynomial time quantum extract or

233
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,240
algorithm

234
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
such that for every arbitrary possibly

235
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,080
malicious sender

236
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,799
the extractor is going to um simulate

237
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,080
two things

238
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
so when the this malicious sender

239
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
interacts with the receiver it has a

240
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
view the quantum view

241
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,279
and also it commits to a message

242
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,640
so um the extractor is going to um

243
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
to simulate

244
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
um say the quantum view and also the

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
committed message like the message under

246
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
the commit

247
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,080
okay

248
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
um

249
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
so here is a very um

250
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
common approach in non-malleable

251
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,839
cryptography we're going to try to get

252
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
from an extractable object to a

253
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
non-malleable commitment

254
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,800
um so this is a successful man in the

255
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
middle it

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,920
manages to commit to the same message

257
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
with a different tag and

258
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
what we know is that if this man in the

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
middle manages to do two things the

260
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,160
first is interaction with the sender on

261
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,200
the left

262
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,399
like by the book regular interaction and

263
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,440
also

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
we

265
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,720
can extract from the men in the middle

266
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
on the right

267
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
so this is an extractable commitment

268
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
the right session in the right session

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
the main in the middle is the sender we

270
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
can try to extract from this end of the

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,959
message if we can do this essentially we

272
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,040
can break the hiding of the extractable

273
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
commitment because the sender just sent

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
the message here m without revealing it

275
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
and we managed to extract the same

276
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,839
message on the right so essentially we

277
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
broke the hiding of the commitment

278
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
and if we can do this we can show normal

279
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
ability

280
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,079
okay

281
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,279
but if we try to extract

282
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,680
usually when we extract information from

283
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
any circuit we need to maybe rewind it

284
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
or have non-black box access

285
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
to this man in the middle and when the

286
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
men in the middle in the normal level

287
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
setting it also includes the sender on

288
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
the left we need to do these same like

289
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
rewinding and non-black box also for the

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
sender

291
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
which is invalid for security reduction

292
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
against the hiding of the extractable

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
commitment on the left

294
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
why still we have non-malleable

295
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
commitments in the classical setting

296
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
is because in the classical setting we

297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
don't just use like plain extractable

298
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
commitments we have like specialized

299
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
techniques that do work in the classical

300
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
settings but we don't know actually

301
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,920
these are some examples we don't know

302
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,839
how to make this specialized techniques

303
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,760
to work in a quantum setting like none

304
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
of them at least until now

305
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,519
um

306
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,240
okay so which brings us to the technical

307
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
question that we asked today is we the

308
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
only extractable cryptographic object we

309
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,279
have in the quantum setting

310
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,560
is um

311
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
no is like plain extractable commitments

312
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
we're trying to build non-valuable

313
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,600
commitments from just plain extractable

314
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
commitments

315
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,399
okay so let's get to the techniques

316
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
we will use extractable commitments but

317
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
with one more

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
property which is first message binding

319
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,079
first message binding just says that if

320
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,600
this is the protocol between the sender

321
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
and the receiver the first message in

322
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
the protocol is from the sender to the

323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,279
receiver and is going to be like

324
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
perfectly binding once in sentence the

325
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
the the value in the entire commitment

326
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
is fixed m

327
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,519
and we show in the paper this is very

328
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,839
easy to show that any standard

329
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,000
extractable commitment can be turned to

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
be felt message binding

331
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,360
okay

332
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
so let's use these

333
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
commitments so this is the first version

334
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
of the protocol

335
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
the first version of the portal called

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,320
the sender is going to first um

337
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
secret shell the message m into n shares

338
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
then it is going to take to take each

339
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
one of these chairs and give an

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,680
extractable commitment to it

341
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,000
sequentially one after the other u1 u2

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,240
and until you end

343
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,200
and

344
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
finally

345
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
this end which we call the block length

346
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
which is also the number of secret

347
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,079
chairs

348
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,399
um we're going to pick it as a function

349
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
of the tag it is going to be

350
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,079
k plus 1

351
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,639
to the tag where k is the number of

352
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,279
messages in the extractable commitment

353
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,959
so just to make sure everything here is

354
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
constant like

355
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,040
k is constant because we have a constant

356
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
round protocol and also the target

357
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,240
because we have a constant number of

358
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
taps

359
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
um okay

360
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
so this first version is intended to

361
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,120
solve the first case the first case is

362
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
when um the tag on the left is bigger

363
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
than the tag on the right

364
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,079
once and and we have like the the number

365
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,200
the block length is for left and right

366
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
and this is a successful man in the

367
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
middle adversary it commits to the same

368
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,639
message m

369
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,360
and what one can show

370
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
which follows from the security of the

371
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,800
secret sharing is that if we interact

372
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
with the honest sender on the left

373
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,880
like we don't need to interact with it

374
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,120
um

375
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
in an honest manner for the entire

376
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
interaction we need to interact with it

377
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
on a single shell for some ui

378
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
not as before for the entire session

379
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,800
and also we managed to extract all of

380
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
the shares on the right we can perform

381
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
the reduction

382
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,079
another thing we can we can see is that

383
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,320
for this choice of parameters

384
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,199
the number of shares on the left is

385
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,040
bigger than the entire number of

386
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
messages on the right

387
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
this means that if we look at this this

388
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,399
like uh more like

389
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
in a more fine-grained manner on the

390
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
interaction between the men in the

391
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,279
middle and the two sides

392
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,920
we always have trivial trivially at

393
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
least one shell which is going to be

394
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
free of interleaving interaction on the

395
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
right we call such on the left

396
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
a free shell

397
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,320
now

398
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,079
the second thing that we use is going to

399
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,480
be the first message binding it means

400
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
that all of the commitments

401
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
that like start the first message of

402
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
them is going to be before the start of

403
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,519
this free um share on the left we can

404
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,079
just fix everything until then

405
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,600
and then start the reduction and then

406
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
have like a non-uniform extraction

407
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
because all of the messages before are

408
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
fixed

409
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,279
okay and for the rest that happen after

410
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,240
this

411
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
free share we can just uh use the the

412
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
online efficient structure extraction

413
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
that we have from the fact that these

414
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
are extractable commitments

415
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,519
okay so this only solves like the first

416
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,680
case where the the the left one is the

417
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
bigger

418
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
and the second one is intended to solve

419
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
the full case

420
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,880
so what do we do

421
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,360
uh when we don't know who which which

422
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
side is going to be bigger

423
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
the sender now is going to um partition

424
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,199
twice m

425
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,839
one into m share and the second one into

426
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
um n head shares

427
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,839
and then it's going to do kind of the

428
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,600
same it's going to give sequential

429
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,519
extractable commitments to the to the

430
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,120
first block and then sequential

431
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,000
extractable commitment to the second one

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,959
and we're going to pick um the the block

433
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,680
length is the first one the top block is

434
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
going to be as before

435
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
and the bottom block is going to be um

436
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
to define like this where tau is the

437
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
number of possible tags which again is

438
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,160
constant

439
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,720
okay so what happens now

440
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
so we show a few things in the paper um

441
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
we first of all we define an ideally

442
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
scheduled um execution of a commitment

443
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
of a block commitment so

444
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
let's let's like uh just make sure that

445
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,320
we we know what's going on we have on

446
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
each of the sides two block commitments

447
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
a top one and a bottom one

448
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
and um

449
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,279
we we say that a commitment a blog

450
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
commitment on the right is ideally

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,839
scheduled if two things happen

452
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,279
first we have that on the um block

453
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
commitment on the left the top one we

454
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
have one free share

455
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,600
and the block commitment on the left

456
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
which the bottom one we also have a free

457
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
share with respect to the same block

458
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,839
commitment on the right

459
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
so here is one example where like

460
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,759
this bottom

461
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,839
right block commitment is free with

462
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,959
respect to u n minus 1 is also free and

463
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,600
non-interleaving with respect to u-hat

464
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
2.

465
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
we also show that um if we have an

466
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
ideally scheduled write block which is a

467
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,399
property of the execution like we can

468
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,759
say

469
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,439
if we had an ideally scheduled block or

470
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
not at the end of the execution

471
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
and um the man in the middle essentially

472
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,160
decides how this is going to play out

473
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
and if we have such block we can do the

474
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
reduction

475
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
okay some additional herders

476
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,880
is that um in the paper we show by like

477
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,919
a

478
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,679
combinatorial uh

479
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
relatively simple argument why there is

480
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,039
always

481
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
um an ideally scheduled block on the

482
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
right

483
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,400
but then we also um as part of a deeper

484
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
analysis of of ensuring the security we

485
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
need to give a zero knowledge proof at

486
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,600
the end

487
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,320
that the two um the m at the top at the

488
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
end of the mod at the bottom of the the

489
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,080
same message essentially

490
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,640
which adds a bit of complexity so we

491
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,520
define ideally scheduled block in a bit

492
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
a bit of a different way but for the

493
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,880
sake of this talk we simplified it

494
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,520
and um

495
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
just to finish the talk with some open

496
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,320
with one open problem um

497
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
the protocol that we get um is locked

498
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
around um in the classical setting we

499
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
have a constant run non-malleable

500
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
commitment protocol we actually have

501
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
many and one i think very nice problem

502
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
is post quantum non-malabar commitments

503
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
with constant rounds

504
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,320
thank you

505
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
it's time for questions

506
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
yes if you could use a microphone for

507
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,160
the benefit of those who watch the

508
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
recording later

509
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
yeah hey

510
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
so i guess in in regards to this open

511
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,679
problem um is it like

512
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,200
if you had sort of

513
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
more

514
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
uh like fancier extractable commitments

515
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
would you sort of immediately get this

516
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
or is there something else in the

517
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
quantum setting that breaks down so i

518
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
think there's something else because if

519
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
if you like uh

520
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
we did get um

521
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
constant number of tags from constant

522
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
constant round we have like uh

523
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
in terms of extractable commitments we

524
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
do have like constant round and epsilon

525
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,520
extractable from one-way function so not

526
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,240
epsilon extractable from just lwe

527
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,039
um it's unclear what are these special

528
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
properties that such constant round

529
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
commitment should have in order for them

530
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,919
to like compile to a full-blown

531
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,960
um

532
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
protocol with exponentially many tax

533
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
so we don't even know what kind of

534
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
property we need

535
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
from the extractable commitments

536
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
i see yeah well like clueless here

537
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
just a as a follow-up this the second

538
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
part of your result the

539
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
amplification is that also like uh do

540
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,520
you need to do something specific for

541
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
the quantum setting or is it no not

542
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
really the the second part is mainly

543
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
technical we look at some classical

544
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
reduction with target purification is

545
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,799
something known in the in the in the

546
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,360
non-malabar setting we just make sure

547
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
that the same actions actually apply to

548
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,280
the quantum setting the the tongue

549
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,799
amplification is

550
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,400
technical but easy thanks

551
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
thanks there are more questions yes

552
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
so hi so uh uh great talk but what about

553
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,679
cca commitments in particular what about

554
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,080
this is a non-interactive cca commitment

555
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
of the kshita karana

556
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,679
uh

557
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,240
is is that something is there some

558
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,760
non-interactive

559
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
cca commitment which is the blood okay

560
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,080
yeah if we looked into this yeah

561
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
no not really

562
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,440
yeah okay please yeah okay thanks

563
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,320
and thanks for the great talk is this is

564
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
it on yes okay

565
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,280
um yeah i wanted to ask about um the

566
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,799
extractable commitment schemes so um the

567
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,480
order one project protocols in the

568
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
classical setting versus your protocol

569
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,760
um

570
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,320
are they all black box extractable or

571
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,159
are are they all non-black box

572
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
retractable or is one one of them yeah

573
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,720
that's that's that's like you're hitting

574
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
the nail on the head so

575
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,880
some are like non-black box extractable

576
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
some of them if you know barracks

577
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
protocol box like zero knowledge

578
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,919
protocol

579
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,760
some non-black box zero knowledge

580
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,000
protocol we did like make them work in

581
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
the quantum setting

582
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
this specifically box protocol is

583
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,880
something that's heavily used in the

584
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
non-malabar setting and we don't know

585
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
how to make it work how to to like to

586
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,320
show that this is post quantum secure

587
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
and this is like one non-black box

588
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,159
example other examples just use

589
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,280
rewinding so there they exist classical

590
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
um constant round non-melville

591
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,159
commitment that don't use non-black box

592
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,440
techniques

593
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,799
yes okay thanks yes

594
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,360
if no one else then

595
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
thank you again

596
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,320
let's beat let's beat

597
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,000
we are two minutes early for the break

598
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
there's a break with refreshments here

599
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,440
we can beat the other crowd

600
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,120
we will be back here

601
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,760
at 16 25.

602
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
you
