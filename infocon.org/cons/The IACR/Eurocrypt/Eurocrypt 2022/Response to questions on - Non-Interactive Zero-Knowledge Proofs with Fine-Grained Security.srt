1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,880
so i was curious actually um

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,400
are there other classes complexity

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,679
classes that are interesting for this

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
kind of problem besides nc1

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,039
or is that is there some reason why

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,359
that's the right thing to look at

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
yes i actually have we have considered

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
this uh this question and we have

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
constructed some new skin other

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,240
complexity

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
classes

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,510
also

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,719
[Music]

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
maybe it's desirable to consider a

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,440
complex complexity of classes which are

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,399
larger

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,760
than the nc1 class such as for example

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,920
in c2 and c3

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
or maybe

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,160
maybe in the other fingering settings

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
such as the

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
memory boundary setting or the time

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,879
boundary setting

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,600
good christian yeah awesome thanks so

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
since we're behind time let's uh thank

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,799
the speaker again and then go to coffee

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,960
thank you
