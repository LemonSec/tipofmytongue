1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,879
it has to click

2
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,039
i know you're there

3
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
what's up i saw the slides

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
okay we'll proceed

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,160
with

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,600
the uh

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,120
presentation

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,600
of the post quantum security of the evan

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,160
mansour cipher by gordon alage chen by

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
jonathan katz and christian mayans and

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
please the floor is used

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,480
thank you very much for the introduction

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
yeah so this will nicely connect to the

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
previous talk because um

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
we are going to look at a very uh

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
similar setting except from the

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
viewpoint of provable security

18
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,320
um i want to give a shout out to my

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
co-author simbai who would have liked to

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
give the talk but couldn't come here

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
because of visa issues

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
here's an outline of my outline of my

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
talk i will start with

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
some motivation

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
i mean i'm in the lucky position that a

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
lot of motivation was already covered by

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
the by the previous talk and by maria's

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,799
talk in the in the morning but still i

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,479
want to add some a little bit of

30
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
perspective from from the provable

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
security side then i will introduce some

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
concepts and present our results and in

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,560
the end

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
hopefully time permitting i will also

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,759
talk about our techniques

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
let's start with the motivation

37
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,960
um

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
there was already a lot of surveys of

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
quantum attacks

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
against cryptographic systems

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,880
um

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
however i want to

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
give give another overview because we we

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
need to to kind of talk about them

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
to compare

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,399
the different models

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
especially the q1 and the q2 model

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
so first of all

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
of course we have post quantum attacks

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
or q1 attacks

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,879
where

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,640
the most

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,480
prominent family is i guess based on

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
short algorithm

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
uh against rsa and discrete log and

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
these are complete breaks of the systems

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
also um against symmetric key

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
cryptography there's um um grover

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
grover's algorithm based attacks and and

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
similar and these are generic attacks

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
against block ciphers and

62
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,280
hash functions for example but also um

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
quantum aided differential and linear

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
cryptanalysis for example

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,920
these are not complete breaks as we have

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,319
seen um in the previous talk and in

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,319
maria's talk but they degrade the

68
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,200
security compared to classical attacks

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
the question is of course by how much

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,400
um

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
finally there's this is this additional

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,360
q2 family of attacks based on simon's

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
algorithm for example

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,080
um

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
and these are for example

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
attacks against even when sewer and

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,519
block cyber modes of

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
operation and these are also complete

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,400
breaks however in this in this strong

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,599
model right and as i will argue later at

81
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,360
least um from the provable security

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
perspective this is um you know it's

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
very strong it's maybe maybe too strong

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,519
maybe not something that's really

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,319
necessary to achieve

86
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,680
now the main motivation um is for for

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
this work is basically

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,159
um this arrow which

89
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,879
for example has materialized with the um

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
with the offline simon's algorithm so

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
the the worry is

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
there could be ideas in these um

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,319
in these q2 model attacks that can be

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,560
ported to the q1 model and then you get

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
attacks that maybe are better than a

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
plane grove research attack and have

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
speed ups that are larger than grove

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,679
research we have as you have just seen

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,239
so in summary

100
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,480
um for symmetric key crypto

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
of course um quantum attacks are far

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
less of a concern than for public key

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
crypto but still where possible

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
uh we should definitely prove post

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
quantum security

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,600
um to achieve certainty to achieve a

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,440
higher confidence in our cryptosystems

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
okay so this this was the the motivation

109
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
so now let me introduce the necessary

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
concepts and

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
we will immediately return to basically

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
um

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
the question what post quantum security

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
actually is especially from a provable

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,520
security perspective

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
so i mean that if the idea is just you

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
know it should be security against

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,639
quantum attacks but um what are

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,520
realistic quantum attacks

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
and there are these two competing um

121
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
models right the q1 model and the q2

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,800
model so let's try to

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
be a bit more formal what exactly that

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
means

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,840
um

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
first of all what's what's common to the

127
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
two models is obviously that quantum

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
computation is allowed for the adversary

129
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,759
that's kind of the defining property

130
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,560
um

131
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,080
one implication that this has is that if

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
we

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
look at an idealized model

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,759
like for example as in the previous talk

135
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,320
with the with the ideal permutation then

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
we need to allow quantum access to the

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
oracles that represent public

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
cryptographic algorithms this is for

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
example in the ideal permutation model

140
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
or in the random oracle model there

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
these oracles represent really an

142
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,680
algorithm that you can look up on the

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,919
wikipedia or whatever and implement on

144
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
your quantum computer so this needs to

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,919
um the quantum queries need to be

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
allowed in in these algorithms in these

147
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
oracles

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
now they start to differ and that's

149
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,319
basically because of two different

150
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
approaches in in the q2 model the

151
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
approach is okay

152
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
how strong of a security model can we

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
imagine um of course the strongest thing

154
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
is to allow quantum access to everything

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,639
where we still have non-trivial security

156
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
possible and this for example includes

157
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,000
quantum access to online primitives

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
so for example um we would then allow

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
quantum chosen plaintext attacks and

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
quantum tools and ciphertext attacks

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,120
quantum tools and message attacks etc

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
however in the q1 model

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
we restrict to classical access of these

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,759
online primitives

165
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
and

166
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
the the reason why this is

167
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
makes sense is basically that our main

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
concern

169
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
is that

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
our devices that we use today i mean

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,960
this one it uses crypto and i'm pretty

172
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,520
sure it doesn't do quantum computation

173
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
so because these online primitives or

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,080
these online queries model um

175
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
computations performed by the honest

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
parties with the cryptosystem it's

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
reasonable to restrict to classical

178
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,759
queries only

179
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,440
so in summary

180
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,319
from a provable security perspective q2

181
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,520
is somewhat unrealistic

182
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
and q1 should be sufficient

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
one interesting challenge in the setting

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
where there's an idealized primitive in

185
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
the q1 model is that there's a mix of

186
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,280
classical and quantum oracles because

187
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,400
online

188
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
offline parameters are quantum and

189
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,960
online primitives are classical and this

190
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
will feature in the evenment store

191
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
setting

192
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
now i almost can skip this slide because

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
evan mansour was introduced a couple of

194
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
times already but maybe somebody um is

195
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,039
here that wasn't to the to the other

196
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,879
talk so let me introduce it one more

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
time the eminem suicide is an extremely

198
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,599
simple cipher that uses

199
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,280
a cryptographic permutation that is

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
modeled as an ideal uniformly random

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
permutation p

202
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,599
from n bits to n bits

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,680
and this is public

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,919
and in the cipher is constructed by

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,080
xoring the key into the message

206
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
then applying the permutation and then

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
xoring

208
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
here the same key but one can also use

209
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,479
the fresh key

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,120
one more time

211
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,440
and sometimes this is the minimal

212
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
construction construction of a block

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
cipher i mean there's literally only

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,240
three operations

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
if we view at this if you review this

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,320
permutation as monolithic

217
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
um however because despite its

218
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
simplicity it has

219
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,000
found quite some applications in

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
particular evan mansour like

221
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,040
constructions feature in for example

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
elephant which is submitted to the

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,959
current ongoing nist lightweight

224
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,959
competition

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
how about security

226
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
so um

227
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
as a reminder the the permutation is

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
considered ideal so an attacker needs to

229
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,920
make queries to this permutation and an

230
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,160
attacker is also allowed queries to the

231
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,880
cipher and the right security notion for

232
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
such

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
a block cipher is that of a pseudorandom

234
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
permutation so the task of an attacker

235
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
is to distinguish

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,560
the cipher from a random permutation

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,200
so now let's look at an adversary that

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
makes qe queries to the cipher and qp

239
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
queries to the permutation the classical

240
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
setting

241
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
is this

242
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
result that has been known for a long

243
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,839
time that the product

244
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,200
um

245
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,160
the product of um the queries to the

246
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
permutation and the the the cipher uh

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
needs to be two to the n or of the order

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
two to the end to achieve a constant

249
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
distinguishing advantage

250
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
um as we've seen a couple of times

251
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
already and as i've mentioned before in

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
the q2 model in this quantum abscess

253
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,560
model um there is an a complete break of

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
the cipher so that's the simon's

255
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,839
algorithm based attack that breaks it

256
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
using order of n queries

257
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,279
now the question is in q1 right there

258
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,240
are attacks known as we have seen

259
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
but there's no

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
currently no or before our work there

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,839
was no proof of security in the q1 model

262
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
okay so let me move on to presenting

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
our results

264
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
and

265
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,880
that basically

266
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
consists of a proof of security for

267
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,399
the even mansur cipher in the post

268
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
quantum setting or in the q1 model

269
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,880
so

270
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
let me go through the theorem together

271
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,399
with you also

272
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
we have two random permutations p and r

273
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
p is the primitive

274
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,519
and r is the random permutation that um

275
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,040
the cipher should be indistinguishable

276
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,519
from and we have the evan mansour cipher

277
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
that's constructed using p

278
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,120
now any quantum adversary that makes at

279
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,920
most qp queries to p quantum queries

280
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
and qe classical queries to

281
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
an oracle o can

282
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
cannot distinguish

283
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
the situation where o is equal to the

284
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
evenment source cipher from the

285
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
situation where o is equal to the random

286
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,079
permutation with an advantage larger

287
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,560
than um the one that is shown on the

288
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
slide

289
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,200
this result was already shown by jager

290
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
song and tesoro

291
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
last year

292
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
four adversaries that in advance of

293
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
their execution declare

294
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
a list of queries that they will make to

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
the cipher and our result is for um

296
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
for the adaptive setting where the

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
adversary can adaptively choose which

298
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,839
inputs to query to the

299
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,200
cipher um

300
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,240
the um bound looks a bit

301
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,200
uh

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
weird in particular because of the sum

303
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,160
right

304
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
um but it turns out that in a very

305
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
natural setting where the number of

306
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
online queries is much smaller than the

307
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,760
number of offline queries

308
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,959
um

309
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,519
it is actually a tight and the sentence

310
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
in the sense that it uh tightly

311
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
characterizes the query complexity of

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
breaking

313
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
every man sewer and that's because of it

314
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,279
it matches the

315
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,600
bht and offline salmon simon's algorithm

316
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,040
okay

317
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,839
so this was the result now there's i

318
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,000
guess plenty of time left to talk a bit

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
about our techniques and

320
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
also a bit of about our technical

321
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
results which might come in handy in the

322
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
future as well

323
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
first let me talk a bit about the

324
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,480
general approach

325
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
so in a classical setting

326
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
um security proofs for evan mansour like

327
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
ciphers usually use what i would call

328
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
global techniques

329
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
so for example

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,440
a popular approach is basically to

331
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
define some bad events that could happen

332
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,360
in terms of the query transcript of an

333
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,480
adversary

334
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
and now basically prove that these bad

335
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,839
events only happen with a small

336
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,480
probability

337
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
another technique is the so-called h

338
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,560
coefficient technique and it also kind

339
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,839
of uses

340
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,120
um

341
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,399
let's say

342
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,200
non-local information about the query so

343
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
information that joins information from

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
several queries together

345
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,880
to

346
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
reach the result and these things are

347
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,839
unfortunately not something one can do

348
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,360
in the quantum setting because if you

349
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
have quantum queries you cannot compile

350
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,519
in general uh query transcript

351
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,399
so one solution to this conundrum

352
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,839
that was recently proposed is gendry's

353
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,320
compressed oracle technique that allows

354
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,760
for um

355
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
in some sense it

356
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
allows to compile a query transcript but

357
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,000
it only works for random functions at

358
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
least currently it is not known how to

359
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
do it for any other family interesting

360
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,760
family of function functions

361
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
so because of that we kind of had to

362
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,639
resort to something more primitive in

363
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
some sense which is a hybrid argument so

364
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,240
there

365
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,120
you just gradually change the

366
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,040
real setting to the ideal setting and

367
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
hope that

368
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
the distinguishability of adjacent

369
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,360
hybrids is not too large

370
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,320
so let me try to explain how we apply

371
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,560
the hybrid argument here so first of all

372
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,560
we um split up the adversary into qe

373
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
plus one stages

374
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,560
one before the first query to the

375
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,240
classical oracle which could be the

376
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
cipher or the random permutation this is

377
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
the task to distinguish the two

378
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,639
and then one between the first and the

379
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,079
second one between the second and the

380
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,519
third etc up to one extra stage after

381
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,760
the last query to the classical archon

382
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
so here

383
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
i want to note that each stage can make

384
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
an arbitrary number of queries to the

385
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
quantum oracle for p

386
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
except that the total number of queries

387
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,560
is bounded by some number qp

388
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,920
so basically the addresser can

389
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,199
adaptively

390
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,959
choose how to distribute the quantum

391
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,000
queries between the different stages

392
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
now the naive idea would be of course to

393
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
replace

394
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,199
the instances of the cipher by random

395
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
permutate by the random permutation one

396
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
by one so we start by replacing the

397
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,360
first call with the random permutation

398
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
then the second etc

399
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
um however there's a subtle issue with

400
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
consistency of the oracles that come up

401
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
and i want to explain this in the next

402
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,120
slide but first of all let me already

403
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,839
present the solution and it's a bit um

404
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,639
let's say um naive sounding but it works

405
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
it's basically to postpone the problem

406
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,720
um until it goes away it sounds magical

407
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,839
but it works

408
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
so here is a little bit more detail

409
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,560
these are our hybrids

410
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,320
so indeed the is hybrid has the first

411
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
eye calls to the classical oracle um be

412
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,880
answered with the random permutation r

413
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
and afterwards we switched to answering

414
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
with the evan mansour construction ek

415
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,199
however

416
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,600
in addition we need to

417
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
modify the permutation a little bit uh

418
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
from that point on where we switch to

419
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
the um even menstrual cipher the reason

420
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,279
why we need to modify this is um the

421
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,600
following so imagine that you have an

422
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
adversary that just breaks the cipher

423
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,480
completely and recovers the key

424
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
then one thing one can do is first make

425
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,759
a couple of random queries then run this

426
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,440
attack to recover the key and then check

427
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
whether the first couple of queries were

428
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
actually answered by their evenment

429
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,599
cipher so that i can now do up a

430
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
posteriori because i have recovered the

431
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
key

432
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,199
and this is of course unfortunate

433
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,039
because um i mean

434
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,480
of course we don't think that it's

435
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
possible to recover the key with with a

436
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
limited amount of queries but we don't

437
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
want to use the result that we're trying

438
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
to prove

439
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
uh to show that basically um the

440
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,919
addresses cannot

441
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,760
notice the switch from the random

442
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
permutation to the cipher

443
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
so therefore we make these modifications

444
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
uh to create um a permutation p tilde

445
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,679
that slightly differs from p

446
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
now the problem is of course that p

447
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,080
tilde gets messed up more and more as i

448
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
grow so we replace more and more queries

449
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,200
uh p tilde gets messed up but if you

450
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
look very closely um there are also

451
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
fewer and fewer calls to p tilde and in

452
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,280
the end

453
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
it's gone

454
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,360
so

455
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,639
there's nothing to worry about

456
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
um

457
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
so on a technical level there's two

458
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
steps in each transition from one hybrid

459
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
to the next

460
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520
and the first one is to replace the

461
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
cipher by a random permutation and to

462
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
repair this uh this permutation to p

463
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,160
tilde at the same time

464
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,600
and the second step is to replace one

465
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
call to p tilde by a call to p right

466
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
because we only want to use p tilde

467
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,440
after the first call to ek

468
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,919
and these two steps translate into two

469
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
technical mrs the first one is one we

470
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
call a resampling lemma for random

471
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
permutations and the second one is a

472
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,880
reprogramming lemma in terms of the

473
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,679
expected number of quantum queries

474
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,960
let me quickly tell you what these are

475
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
so the resampling lemma is a permutation

476
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,039
version of what we used to call the

477
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,200
adaptive reprogramming lemma in a work

478
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
by alex brillo with kathleen hoover

479
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
months andreas wilson and myself

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,559
and um this is basically

481
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,000
um

482
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,559
a game where um an adversary needs to

483
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,440
detect whether the perpetration has been

484
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
modified but in a way that's consistent

485
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,799
with the distribution of a random

486
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,160
permutation

487
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
and um i don't think i have time to

488
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,320
describe the game in detail but um we

489
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
can show that this kind of change in the

490
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
permutation can only be set with a small

491
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
advantage

492
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
um the second technical lemma is um

493
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
an expected number of queries version of

494
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
um

495
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
the so-called blinding lemma that we

496
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,799
introduced in earlier work with

497
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,200
with guarana alligators alex russell and

498
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,559
frank song

499
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,440
and

500
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
there basically um the addressee can

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,799
just decide everything except that some

502
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,200
reprogramming happens that's randomized

503
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
and the adversary needs to find out

504
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
whether it happened or not

505
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
and the important part here is that we

506
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
get about in the terms of the expected

507
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
number of queries because as if you

508
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,799
remember each state of the adversary

509
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,240
could make an arbitrary number of

510
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,000
queries except that it was bounded by

511
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,240
the total number of queries and the sum

512
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
was bounded so um somehow this expected

513
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,799
number of grace um avoids us to to get

514
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,120
another loss in in terms of the number

515
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
of classical queries

516
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
so um

517
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
i don't think i have time to

518
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,799
talk about the reprogramming game in

519
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,480
detail but here really the adversary

520
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,080
supplies a function then it's

521
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,840
reprogrammed and the or not and the

522
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,520
address a has to detect

523
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
and this game has um the typical

524
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,159
advantage that you would expect in a

525
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,640
setting where a grover search is is

526
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,039
possible

527
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,000
okay

528
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
so um i think it's time to summarize

529
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
so we have proved the post quantum

530
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,039
security of the evenment sewer cipher

531
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,919
um

532
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,880
and this is in this q1 model um

533
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,280
that is um should be sufficient for

534
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
security of classical cryptographic

535
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,600
algorithms

536
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
i mentioned applications of um even

537
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
mansur-like constructions the reason why

538
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,559
i didn't go into detail is because these

539
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,799
applications at least for example the

540
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,600
applications to elephant and also the

541
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,600
iso standardized mac task key

542
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,120
they actually use

543
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
generalized versions of the evenment

544
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
sewer construction

545
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,520
also this work by jagerdal that proved

546
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,840
the non-adaptive setting they can

547
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
actually prove

548
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
security of the fx construction that you

549
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,039
have seen in the previous talk as well

550
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
and for this we have some follow-up work

551
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,960
by the same set of authors plus public

552
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,919
struck

553
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,640
and i guess this will be on eprint

554
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
soon

555
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
i hope

556
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,600
um

557
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
finally i want to

558
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,480
slip in a shameless piece of um

559
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
advertisement so i expect to be able to

560
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,159
open a phds to position in fall in

561
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,480
beautiful copenhagen

562
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
so if you know anybody please them ask

563
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,918
them to apply

564
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,559
thank you very much

565
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
thank you very much for ending with the

566
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,559
see you on eprin soon

567
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,480
line um questions

568
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,039
go on yes yes please

569
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,440
use the microphone otherwise we won't

570
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
hear you

571
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,039
you shout

572
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,840
the microphone is here

573
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
it's a very short question i was just

574
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
curious about the probability of a

575
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,679
distinguishing advantage in in the

576
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,080
adaptive setting that you guys showed

577
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,559
versus the non-adaptive was it the same

578
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,200
or was there uh

579
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,159
again so um

580
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,360
it's

581
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,840
definitely the same up to the constant

582
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,799
and the constant is almost all the same

583
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
i i don't remember exactly but i think

584
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
the constant is within a factor of two

585
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
of each other

586
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
so it's really the same amount which is

587
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
surprising in some sense because their

588
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
technique is

589
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,480
completely different

590
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,840
returning my question from

591
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,840
just just to keep you alive here um

592
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
returning to the quantum models q1 q2

593
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,159
how likely is it for a hardware designer

594
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,000
to understand whether they are probed

595
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
classically

596
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
whether their hardware itself is broke

597
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,120
classically or quantumly is there

598
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
a chance to

599
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
detect this in some in a certain way

600
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
because the difference between the

601
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
models where you can

602
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
query

603
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
with a quantum signal with a classical

604
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
signal yeah right

605
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,720
um yeah i mean that's that's this um

606
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,679
kind of

607
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,440
it's almost a meme there's this this

608
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,679
idea of the frozen smart card where you

609
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,120
can kind of

610
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
force it to behave like a quantum um

611
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,039
device

612
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,799
i don't think it's personally i don't

613
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
think it's very realistic in particular

614
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
if i have my phone in my pocket it's

615
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,919
very warm

616
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,600
for quantum standards

617
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,640
and

618
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
so i'm pretty confident that it doesn't

619
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
do quantum computation

620
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
i think um

621
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,679
if you can achieve q2 security

622
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,240
without a lot of extra cost

623
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
you should definitely go for it because

624
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,000
what's the loss right and and then you

625
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,840
don't you use the kind of you know you

626
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
can forget about uh that worry at least

627
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
definitely agree on the other hand we

628
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
saw yesterday morning

629
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,080
that they don't attack your smart card

630
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,679
and while it's in your pocket they have

631
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,919
a lap we have a lab

632
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,320
taken out and it's that's where we

633
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,400
securities will will be

634
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
tested uh

635
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
to real adversaries that's that's true

636
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,840
but um

637
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,320
still i think uh

638
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
the the main picture that i at least

639
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,000
have in my mind is um basically a lab

640
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,799
where somebody tries to take a cheap

641
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,279
classical device and try to force it to

642
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,320
behave it behave quantumly versus the

643
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,400
insane engineering feats that people try

644
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,799
to go through uh to try and create an

645
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,480
actual quantum computer so somehow this

646
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
gives me a lot of confidence that

647
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
there's no accidental quantum

648
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,520
computation um

649
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
thank you

650
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,880
hey thanks for the nice talk i was just

651
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,960
curious have you thought about how

652
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
um

653
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,279
the best attacks would change if you

654
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
could pre-process the permutation in

655
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
evan mansour so say the attacker looks

656
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,279
at the entire permutation in advance

657
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,039
stores some advice and then and then the

658
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,640
attack is is as q1 here right that's a

659
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
very interesting question

660
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
so that's basically um this class of

661
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
models that's called uh auxiliary input

662
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,559
or random model and in this case it

663
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
would be auxiliary integra random

664
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,480
permutation model right

665
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
um

666
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,520
i i don't know how it changes

667
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,480
and one thing that i can say is that

668
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,200
um as far as i know

669
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
the results that are known for auxiliary

670
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,799
input models

671
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,039
they're quite complicated to prove and

672
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,400
in particular

673
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,320
some of them use january's compressed

674
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,679
oracle technique

675
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,240
and this of course poses a challenge in

676
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
the setting with a random permutation

677
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
awesome thanks

678
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,240
thank you again
