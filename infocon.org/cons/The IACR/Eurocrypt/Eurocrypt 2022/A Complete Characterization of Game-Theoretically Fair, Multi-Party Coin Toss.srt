1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
hi everyone i'm cool from kanning malay

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
university i'll present our work a

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,759
complete characterization of game theory

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,559
technically fair maori party coin toss

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
this is a joint work with gil ashara

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
from bar elon university in olynyk from

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
cmu

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,039
my advisor elaine and i

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,439
are two co-organizers of the cmu crypto

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
seminar and we need to decide the food

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,279
for the seminar

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,279
i prefer sushi while a link prefer cake

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,600
we cannot persuade each other so we

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
decide to toss a random coin

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,879
if the output is zero then i win and we

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,760
will order sushi otherwise a ling wing

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,200
and we will order cake

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
since we're in different city this week

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,320
we decide to do bloms coin toss protocol

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
on blockchain

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
we each choose a random bit and post the

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
commitment of the random bid on the

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
blockchain

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
if you're not familiar with blockchain

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,079
you can think of it as a public bulletin

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
board so after we post the commitments

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,439
everyone can see them on the blockchain

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,040
after we both post the commitments we

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,439
each open our random bit and post the

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
opening on blockchain

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
let's say elaine's random bit is zero

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
and my random bit is one

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,320
the output will be the xor of these two

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
random bits which is one

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
so elaine wings and we will order a cake

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
however i really want to eat sushi

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
after ellen posed her beat on blockchain

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
i know that i'm gonna lose the game if i

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
open my pit

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,439
so what if i refuse to open my

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,200
commitments

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,360
in this case elaine just automatically

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,720
wins and the outcome would be won so

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
still we will order cake

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
this is the famous blomscoin host

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
protocol back to 1983.

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,640
it guarantees that a strategic player

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,200
like me cannot bias the output towards

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
my preference

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,119
formally in the coin toss protocol the

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,599
goal is to output a random coin that is

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
publicly verifiable

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
the correctness requires that um if

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
everyone is honest

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
then the output should be uniformly

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
random

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
the fairness notion considered in

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
traditional literature

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,760
is called strong fairness or

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
unbiasability

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
which requires that a strategic player

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
cannot bias the outputs towards either

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,640
direction

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
unfortunately

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
um this is shown to be impossible by

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
cleve in 1986.

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
indeed even in bloom's coin toss

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,360
protocol we just saw i can always bias

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
the output towards one

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,000
by refusing to open the commitment

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,160
the fairness notion achieved by blum's

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,440
coin hospital is actually more of a game

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
theory favor

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,400
for game theoretic fairness

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
it requires that a strategic player

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
cannot benefit herself by deviating from

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
the protocol

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
now that we've seen bloms coin toss

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
protocol which achieves game theoretic

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
fairness for two-party coin tasks

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
a natural question to ask is that can we

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
achieve game theoretic fairness for

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,200
multi-party point tasks

84
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
in multi-party coin toss several players

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,799
get together to toss a binary coin

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,280
each player has a preference that is

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,599
publicly available

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
let's say uh for example kittens and i

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,959
prefer sushi and we call them sushi

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,080
people

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,959
while puppies and elaine prefer cake so

92
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
we call them cake people

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
some of these players will get together

94
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
to form a coalition

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,040
they will coordinate with each other and

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
try to bias the output to increase their

97
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
utility

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,720
the utility we consider is quite natural

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,840
if i like the output i gain utility one

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
and the utility of a collision is just

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,480
the sum of the utility of the players in

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
this collision

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
for example if the output is cake then

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
this collision in the figure gains

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
utility three

106
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,238
and if the output is sushi then this

107
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,800
coalition gain utility too

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
therefore the preference of a coalition

109
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
is actually the preference of majority

110
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
players in this coalition

111
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,320
now

112
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
for maori party coin toss the game

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
theoretic fairness notion we consider is

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
slightly different

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
now we care more about the behavior of a

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,040
coalition rather than a strategic player

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
for maori party coin toss game theoretic

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
fairness requires that a collision

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
cannot increase its expected utility by

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
deviating from the protocol

121
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
so if according host protocol is game

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,080
theoretic fair against coalition of size

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,120
t

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
then the honest protocol is actually a

125
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,560
t-sized coalition-resistant nash

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
equilibrium because this best strategy

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
for the collision is just to follow the

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
protocol honestly

129
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,039
so why do we care about this game

130
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
theoretic fairness

131
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,039
because we know that strong fairness is

132
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
impossible against half-sized coalition

133
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,320
however in many decentralized

134
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
applications for example uh voting on a

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,479
blockchain

136
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,280
many pseudonyms may be controlled by the

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
same entity and these pseudonyms they

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
will coordinate together and they may

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,600
deviate from the protocol to gain

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
benefit

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
it is very likely that these pseudonyms

142
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
form a majority-sized coalition so we do

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
need some meaningful fairness notion

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,840
that is achievable against a majority

145
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
sized coalition

146
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
game theoretic fairness

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
is exactly such a notion that is

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,199
slightly weaker than strong fairness yet

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
still meaningful and suitable for

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,479
decentralized applications

151
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,080
um unfortunately

152
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
game theoretic fairness for multi-party

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
coin task protocol is shown to be

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
impossible against a minus one size

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,440
coalition due to cleves result uh due to

156
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
trend adults right

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,639
adults result back to 1918.

158
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
so a natural question to ask

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
is that can we achieve game therapy

160
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,960
fairness for multi-party coin toss

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
against small sized coalition

162
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
let's say majority size but not

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
necessarily a minus one

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
and the answer is yes

165
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
to convince you i'll first show you a

166
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,240
very simple strumming solution for four

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
players let's say we have two sushi

168
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,599
people and two cake people

169
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
in the straw man solution each group

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,639
first arbitrarily choose a

171
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
representative let's say it's the kitten

172
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
and the puppy

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
then these two representatives deal with

174
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
each other using blum's coin house

175
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
protocol

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,759
the output of this bloms called protocol

177
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,080
will be the coin for four-party coin

178
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,080
tasks

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,759
so this very simple protocol is getting

180
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
theoretically fair against coalition of

181
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,199
size 2.

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,440
note that if the coalition contains one

183
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,479
sushi person and one cake person

184
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,319
then this coalition actually has no

185
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
preference and they can never increase

186
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
their expected utility

187
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
so we don't care what they do to the

188
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
coin

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
if the coalition contains two sushi

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,479
people

191
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,199
then by blom's coin host protocol

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,840
the sushi representative cannot bias the

193
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,759
output what sushi

194
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,639
and so this coalition cannot benefit by

195
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,120
deviating from the protocol

196
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
the same argument works for the case if

197
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,639
the coalition continues to kick people

198
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
so we can't achieve game theoretic

199
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
fairness for four-party coin toss

200
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
against coalition of size two

201
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,720
this isn't evidence that it is true

202
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
that we can achieve game theoretic

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
fairness for some meaningful parameter

204
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
region

205
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
actually this very simple strumming idea

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
generalizes to any number of players as

207
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
long as the collision is outside at most

208
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,199
two

209
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
so on the achievability side for a

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
collision of size less than half

211
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
we can achieve strong fairness

212
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
and of course game theoretic variants

213
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,200
through multi-party computation

214
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
if the collision is of size smaller than

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,159
two

216
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,600
then we can use this drawing solution

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
on the impossibility side

218
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
turn at all showed that it is impossible

219
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,000
to achieve game theoretic fairness

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,279
against a minus one sized coalition

221
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,240
so

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,040
we ask the question under what size of

223
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
coalition

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,800
is it possible to achieve game theoretic

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,399
fairness

226
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,120
exactly where should we draw the line

227
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
the boundary between feasibility and

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,640
invisibility

229
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
this work answers this question

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
we explored the broad range of

231
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,519
parameters of collision size between

232
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,600
half and n minus one

233
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
so in this work we give a complete

234
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,399
characterization of game theoretic

235
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,519
fairness

236
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
we give a

237
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
construction of a game theoretic fair

238
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,000
coin toss protocol against team-sized

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,279
coalition

240
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,760
and we show that game theoretic fairness

241
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
is impossible against t plus one science

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
coalition

243
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
um i'll give the expression of t to you

244
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
later

245
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
so

246
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,160
in the rest of the talk we will mainly

247
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
focus on the construction of the

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
protocol

249
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
still to convey the main idea we will

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
use a simple example of six players

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
three sushi people and three cake people

252
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
this structure is quite simple we let

253
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
the sushi people choose a random coin at

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,279
zero

255
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,279
and then we let the cake people choose a

256
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,279
random point s1

257
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,839
the output will just be the xor of these

258
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
two random bits

259
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
but where do the random coin s0 and s1

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
come from

261
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
so for easier understanding we assume a

262
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
secret sharing trusted authority

263
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
parameterized with k

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
that choose a random queen s for us

265
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,880
and satisfy the following properties

266
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,480
first only k or more players can ask the

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,839
authority to reveal the value of s

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,040
and second

269
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
any k or more players can choose to

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,079
rewrite the value of s before any reveal

271
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
request

272
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,079
as a heads up this trusted authority can

273
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,880
be implemented by standard crypto

274
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
and we do not need to assume trusted

275
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
authority in our final protocol

276
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
so this trusted authority is just um for

277
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,760
better understanding during the talk

278
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,440
with this trusted authority our protocol

279
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
works as follows

280
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
first each group has a trusted authority

281
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,480
with parameter case set to be two

282
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
the sushi authority first choose a

283
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,120
random coin at zero

284
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
and then if and then if the collision

285
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
wants to rewrite the value of queen s0

286
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
it has to be now

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
then the cake authority choose a random

288
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
coin s1

289
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
still if the coalition wants to rewrite

290
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
the value of s1 it has to be at this

291
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,880
point

292
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,720
no rewrite is allowed after

293
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
then sushi people sends reveal requests

294
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
to the trusted authority to reveal the

295
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,519
value of s0 on blockchain

296
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,279
then the kick people send reveal

297
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,600
requests to kick authority to reveal the

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,880
value of s1 on blockchain

299
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,440
if both coin revealed successfully the

300
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,839
output is the xor of these two random

301
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
coins

302
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
however if s0 is not revealed because

303
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
two or more sushi people refuse to

304
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,839
reveal

305
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,880
but coin s1 is successfully revealed on

306
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,360
the blockchain then in this case the

307
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,519
output of the protocol is just the coin

308
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,519
s1

309
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
on the other hand if the coin s0 is

310
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,000
revealed but s1 is not revealed what

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
should we output

312
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,040
should we output s0

313
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
so definitely not

314
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
we should output 0 instead of s0

315
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,880
this is because by the time when the

316
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
sushi people decides whether they want

317
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
to reveal s1

318
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,760
they already see the value of s0 on the

319
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,279
blockchain

320
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,720
so even if a collision of only two cake

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
people

322
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
they can bias the output by deciding

323
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
whether they want to reveal the coin s1

324
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
after they saw the value of s0 on the

325
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
blockchain

326
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
this means that if we choose to output

327
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
as 0 if s1 fails to be revealed

328
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
then we will only be able to tolerate

329
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
collision of size 1.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,839
so instead we will output 0 as a heavier

331
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,920
punishment for the cake people if they

332
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
refuse to reveal the value of s1

333
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,440
so this six player coin toss protocol

334
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
actually achieves game theoretic

335
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,760
fairness against coalition of size up to

336
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,959
four

337
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,399
to see this

338
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
if this coalition contains two sushi

339
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
people and two cake people

340
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
they actually have no preference

341
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
and they can never because they can

342
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
never increase their utilities so we

343
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,399
don't care what they do to the coin

344
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
if the coalition contains three sushi

345
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
people and a single kick person

346
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
then this coalition can decide the value

347
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,120
of s-0 because they can rewrite the coin

348
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,199
however as we mentioned when they

349
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
rewrite the coin s0 they know nothing

350
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
about s1

351
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
so the coin s1 is still an independent

352
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
uniformly random coin chosen by the cake

353
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
authority

354
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
that is guaranteed to be revealed due to

355
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,320
the two honest kick people

356
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
so if the coalition choose to review

357
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,199
coin at zero then the output should be

358
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,439
s0x4 with s1

359
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
if they choose not to reveal serial

360
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,079
at the time when they decide whether

361
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,560
they want to choose reveal s0 they know

362
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
nothing about coin s1

363
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
so the output is an independent

364
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
uniformly random point s1 children by

365
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,638
the cake authority

366
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
on the other hand if the coalition

367
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,959
contains three cake people and a single

368
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,399
social person

369
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,800
by a similar argument

370
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,199
they can control the value of point s1

371
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
at the time when they know nothing about

372
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,639
s0

373
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,199
so if they choose to reveal s1 the

374
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,720
output would be s0 xor with s1 which is

375
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
uniformly random

376
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,279
if they choose not to reveal s1

377
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,720
then the output will directly be zero

378
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,639
i believe smart as they are they will

379
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
never do this because this brings them

380
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
no benefit

381
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,800
so

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,440
this protocol is game theoretically fair

383
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
against coalition of size 4.

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
can we generalize it

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
and the answer is positive

386
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,040
this idea actually generalizes to

387
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,199
arbitrary number of players

388
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
and this table gives the maximum size of

389
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,000
the coalition we can tolerate with this

390
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
protocol

391
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
in this table m1 is the number of kick

392
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,079
people and n0 is the number of sushi

393
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,600
people

394
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,160
for simplicity i ignored the ronnie here

395
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,040
and without loss of generality we assume

396
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
n1 is at least n0

397
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,600
and this is the landscape of the

398
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
achievability and ancient ability of

399
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,320
game theoretic fairness

400
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
it turns out that the landscape of game

401
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
theoretic fairness is darkly different

402
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
from the de facto strong fairness

403
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,160
in this plot the x-axis denotes the

404
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
number of sushi people in the y-axis

405
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
denotes the number of cake people the

406
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
z-axis here is the size of the coalition

407
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
this red plane is the boundary between

408
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,199
visibility and invisibility of game

409
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
theoretic fairness

410
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,839
for any region below this red plane we

411
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
can achieve game theoretic fairness

412
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
and for any region above we cannot

413
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,880
as a comparison this blue plane is the

414
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,240
boundary of invisibility and visibility

415
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
for strong fairness which is exactly

416
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,399
half

417
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
of the number of players

418
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
from this figure we can see that there

419
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,600
is indeed a meaningful region

420
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,079
for which we can achieve game theoretic

421
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,359
fairness but not strong fairness

422
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,319
and moreover we can see that

423
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,199
the achievability of game theoretic

424
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,880
fairness is not only related to the size

425
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,039
of the collision but also the

426
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,439
relationship between the number of sushi

427
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,720
people and the number of people

428
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,360
to wrap up in this work we give a game

429
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,520
theoretically fair coin toss protocol

430
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
against his science coalition and we

431
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
show that game theoretic fairness is

432
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,120
impossible against any t plus one sized

433
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
coalition

434
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,440
and t is summarizing the table below

435
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
here n1 is the number of cake people and

436
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,400
n zero is the number of sushi people

437
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
when n one is much larger than n zero

438
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,120
then we can tolerate coalition of size

439
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,240
of two and one minus half and zero

440
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
moreover if m one equal to n zero and

441
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
they're equal to odd then we can

442
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,160
tolerate n0 plus one sized coefficient

443
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
as in the sixth clear example we just

444
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
saw

445
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
otherwise we can tolerate a coalition of

446
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
size up to two thirds and one plus one

447
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,160
third and zero

448
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
in the work

449
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
we also give other results we give a

450
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,000
complete characterization of another

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,960
fairness notion which requires that no

452
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,559
coalition can harm any honest individual

453
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,640
we also give complete characterization

454
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,799
of these two fairness notions on their

455
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,559
other natural utility functions

456
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
and this is the reference for the paper
