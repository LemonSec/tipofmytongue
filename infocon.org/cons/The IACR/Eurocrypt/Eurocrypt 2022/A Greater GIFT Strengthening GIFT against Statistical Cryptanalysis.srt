00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,240
hello everyone the name of the

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,040
presentation is a greater gift

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,000
strengthening gift against statistical

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,559
crypt analyze

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
we start with the motivation of this

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
work

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,920
the work in this paper is inspired from

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
the automatic searching results related

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
to differential and linear cryptanalysis

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,560
of gift 6a4

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,920
we first look into the server in itself

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,800
and try to discover more properties

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
apart from the quantitative information

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
about activist boxes

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,559
differential probabilities and linear

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,160
correlations

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,920
in the second part

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
given the gap between the upper bounds

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,039
on the differential probability and the

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,800
linear correlation

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
we wonder whether we can find the

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,559
vibrant with analogous security levels

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,559
under the differential and linear

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,640
settings

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,479
now we briefly reveal some preliminaries

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,080
gift is a family of lightweight block

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
zappers purposed by bennet at all

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,400
we consider gift 64 which is a 64-bit

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
block cipher with a 128k

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,880
and with 28 rounds

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,159
each round consists of three steps

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
the subcell operation applies a an

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,280
invertible 4 bit xbox to a enable of the

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
several state

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
then the perm bit operation permits the

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,799
state in a bit oriented manner

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,159
following that

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,600
the advanced k operation as the round k

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
and the round constant

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
gift was designed at 10 years after the

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
publication of present

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,600
it has much increased efficiency in

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,960
hardware and software implementations

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
and this is realized by using an s-box

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
with a lower implementation cost

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,720
at the same time to avoid consecutive

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
one-to-one bit differential and linear

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,080
transitions in the server the design of

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
the bit permutation is carefully studied

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
the 16x boxes are grouped into two

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,959
different ways

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,519
the first one is the quotient group and

53
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
the second one is the remainder group

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,360
with this notation the design of the

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,920
64-bits permutation is converted into

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
the construction of four independent and

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,280
identical 16-bit permutations that maps

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
the output bits of the quotient group to

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,720
the input bits of the remainder group

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
the voda paradigm is a guideline for the

61
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,080
creation of the 16-bit group mapping

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
it considers the one-to-one big ddt of

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
the xbox and displays the input and

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
output positions into four sets

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
notice that a bad output could come from

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
a one-to-one bit transition through a

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
certain xbox in the current round

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
to ensure that the exciting one to one

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
bit transition will not have had to

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
another one to one bit transition in the

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
succeeding round the differential botf

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,319
permutation artificially maps the active

73
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,519
bits of the potentially bad output

74
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
to an active bits of some good inputs in

75
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,640
the next round

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
similarly in the linear case the linear

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,799
boj implementation can be derived

78
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
regarding the one to one bit lat

79
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,360
the bogr permutation should be

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
differential and linear voja

81
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,799
permutations simultaneously

82
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,560
for gift the body permutation is fixed

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
as a identity margin

84
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,798
now we introduce the first part of this

85
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
work and give theoretical explanations

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,960
on differential and linear properties of

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,080
gift 6a4

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,479
through analyzing the automatic

89
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,400
searching results related to

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
differential group analyze we observe

91
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
that the minimum number of differential

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
active s-boxes sd

93
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
is linearly dependent on r for all are

94
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
greater than 7.

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
further after decoding the optimal

96
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
differential characteristics

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
with the maximum probability from the

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
output of the sets over

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,720
the they observed that the optimal

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
characteristics covering more than seven

101
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
rounds always have two active s-boxes in

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
each round

103
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,639
so we wonder is there a characteristic

104
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
with a single active s-box in some

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
rounds achieving the maximum

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,039
differential probability

107
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,520
to answer this question we first

108
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,120
consider a small set of differential

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,479
characteristics d1

110
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
the characteristics in this set

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,639
has have at least one round activating a

112
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,400
single x-box

113
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,199
and the input difference of the active

114
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
x-box equals one

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
they manage to calculate the lower bound

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,600
on the number of active x-boxes for

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,039
characteristics in this set

118
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,840
the automatic method is applied to

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,360
accomplish this task and we split the

120
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
search into three steps

121
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
in the first step

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
they explore the lower bound four

123
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,560
characteristics with input difference

124
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
having a single non-zero number being

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
one then the characteristics with output

126
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
difference having a single non-zero

127
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,199
label taking one are considered

128
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
in the third step

129
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,759
we note that the characteristics in d1

130
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,880
can be created basically characteristics

131
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
in the first two steps

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
so the lower bound for characteristics

133
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,800
in this set is derived from the

134
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
experimental results in the first two

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
steps

136
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,400
the experimental results revealed that

137
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,000
lower bound on the seti ban is strictly

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,880
higher than the original bound then the

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
number of rounds is greater than seven

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
the same result holds for all sets d i

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,759
without taking any non-zero neighbor

142
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
so we draw the vertical proposition

143
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
if r greater than seven

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
the optimal iron differential

145
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,880
characteristic of gift 64 with the

146
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
minimum number of activist boxes must

147
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,039
have two active s-boxes in each round

148
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,680
uh then with a similar analyzing

149
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
regarding the

150
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,479
differential probability we give the

151
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
second proposition

152
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
if r greater than seven the optimal are

153
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,479
on differential characteristics

154
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,680
with the maximum probability must

155
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,479
activate at least two x-boxes per round

156
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
now it seems that differential

157
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
characteristics activating two as boxes

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
in each round there is a crucial rule in

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,039
the security evaluation for gift 64.

160
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,160
so we wonder whether we can inform

161
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,720
more properties of this characteristics

162
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
apart from the quantitative information

163
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
about activeness boxes

164
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
before looking into these

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,199
characteristics we first devise an

166
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,520
alternative description for the round

167
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,879
function

168
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,759
in the alternative description we keep

169
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,120
sub cells and add round k operations and

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
further decompose permits operation into

171
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
two sample versions

172
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,360
the group maps operation invokes a

173
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,120
16-bit permutation and they

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,599
independently applied it on each of the

175
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,120
quotient group

176
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,839
the following transable operation works

177
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,559
enable this alternative description is

178
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,959
called the bit oriented one

179
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
if we recognize the cipher state as a

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
four multiply four metric of labels

181
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,640
the bit oriented description can be

182
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
replaced with the label oriented one

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
the nibble oriented description is more

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,680
concise and facilitates the following

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
analyze

186
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,959
now giving a differential

187
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,200
characteristics with two active s boxes

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,160
per round they assume that the two

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,480
activist box in the asron are located in

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
the same column and donates the

191
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
differential propagation of the group

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
mapping on this column as this

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
we show that this propagation should

194
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
meet four conditions so that the

195
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
differential characteristic based on

196
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,880
eight consistent two activist boxes in

197
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
round r minus one and r plus one

198
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,440
in other words these are necessary

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
conditions for publications in long

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,120
differential characteristics with two

201
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
active as boxes per round

202
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
summarizing or analyzing the proof of

203
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,200
four conditions

204
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
we derive the third proposition

205
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
for an iron differential characteristic

206
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,720
uh activating two s boxes per round if

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
the two active s boxes in the arthron

208
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
are located in the same column

209
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,279
then for all i bases in equality the two

210
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,360
activist boxes in the r plus two s

211
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
rounds are located in the same column

212
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
then they derive a lemma which tells the

213
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
head of the target characteristic

214
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,160
for the cipher if a differential

215
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
characteristic activates two x-boxes per

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,560
round

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
then the two activist boxes in one of

218
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,880
the first two rounds must be located in

219
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,600
the same column of the magic states

220
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
based on lemma 1 and the proposition 3

221
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
they conclude that all differential

222
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
characteristics with two active s boxes

223
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
per round can be decomposed into several

224
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
pieces of two round characteristics

225
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,920
for which the two actives boxes in the

226
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
first round are located in the same

227
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,600
column

228
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,040
furthermore the differential

229
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,720
perpendiculations abstracted from these

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
two round characteristics fulfills four

231
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
conditions

232
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
on the other side the characteristics

233
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
with two activist boxes per round can be

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
constructed artificially

235
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
consider two differential propagations

236
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
validating four conditions

237
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,279
if gamma i to r5 brand are possible

238
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,560
transitions

239
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
then the two propagations are said to be

240
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
compatible with each other

241
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
as shown in the figure we can craft long

242
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,160
differential characteristics activating

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,680
two as boxes programmed with compatible

244
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
propagations

245
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
we implement a test and funds 26

246
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,360
propagations validating four conditions

247
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,839
then we evaluate the compatibilities

248
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
among them and illustrate the result in

249
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,639
the figure

250
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,320
after removing some isolated nodes and

251
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
short parts

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,839
we note that the graph contains several

253
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,440
cycles on the one hand this cycle

254
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,839
theoretically explains the existence of

255
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,639
long differential characteristics with

256
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,079
two active x-boxes per round

257
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,880
on the other hand accompanied by the

258
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,399
preceding analysis we conclude that any

259
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,720
differential characteristics covering

260
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,680
more than seven rounds with two active s

261
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,120
boxes per round must utilize certain

262
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,720
passes in the figure

263
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,639
in addition the cycle also enables us to

264
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,079
enumerate all optimal differential

265
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,519
characteristics by hand

266
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,880
they propose an explicit formula for the

267
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
differential probability of the optimal

268
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
characteristic

269
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,839
and prove that there are 288

270
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,040
optimal characteristics with an odd

271
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,160
number of grounds and 10

272
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,680
and 400 optimal characteristics with an

273
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,720
even number of rounds

274
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
in parallel to the case of differential

275
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
setting we derive some analytic results

276
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
in the linear setting

277
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
similarly we show that if r is greater

278
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
than 9 the optimal iron linear

279
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
characteristic of gift 64 with the

280
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
minimum number of active s boxes

281
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,639
must activate 2 x boxes per round

282
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,120
the linear correlation bond is also

283
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
studied however

284
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,480
unlike the case in differential setting

285
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
the optimal linear characteristic with

286
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,360
the maximum correlation can contain

287
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,880
characteristics with a single active

288
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,240
x-box in some realms

289
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,839
we check the properties of linear

290
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,680
characteristics with two as active as

291
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,519
boxes in each round and then that these

292
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
characteristics also can be constructed

293
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,639
artificially

294
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,320
we found 46 useful linear propagations

295
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
and unless compatibilities among them

296
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,079
based on the cycle in the graph they

297
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,440
also theoretically explain the existence

298
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,079
of non-linear characteristics

299
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
with two activist boxes per round

300
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,360
next we turn to the question proposed in

301
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
the first beginning

302
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
can we improve get 64.

303
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
note that there are two thousand three

304
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,240
hundred and four group mappings meet all

305
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
requirements for the binding gift 64.

306
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,120
so

307
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
they managed to find the virus

308
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
constructed with the new group mapping

309
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,279
that processes comparable upper bounds

310
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,839
on the differential probability and the

311
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,920
linear correlation

312
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,040
to reduce the number of candidates by

313
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,519
implementing classification

314
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,040
the position 7 points out of sufficient

315
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,279
condition for two variants being

316
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,759
equivalent to each other

317
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
based on this proposition we define an

318
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,160
equivalence relation on the set of all

319
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,759
gives 64 lakh circles and partition the

320
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,399
set into

321
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,959
168 equivalence classes

322
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,440
therefore we only need to check the

323
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
property of one representative in each

324
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,839
possible equivalence classes and the

325
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,240
number of candidates is reduced from

326
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,800
2303 to 167

327
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
we apply the automatic method to search

328
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
for upper bounds on differential

329
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,279
probabilities and linear correlations of

330
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,600
167 representative variants

331
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
the test results are illustrated in the

332
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,600
figure

333
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
it can be noticed that the security of

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,480
gift 64 against the differential group

335
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
analyzed is moderate among all

336
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,880
representatives

337
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
and the capability against linear

338
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,279
cryptanalyze

339
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,160
is almost among the best of candidates

340
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,399
then they consider the combination of

341
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,199
differential and linear properties

342
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
according to the length of the optimal

343
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,759
effective differential and linear

344
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
characteristics

345
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,680
the

346
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,639
168 representatives can be divided into

347
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,720
17 groups

348
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
the performance of gift 64 resisting

349
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,720
differential and linear attacks is good

350
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
and the 40 representatives achieve

351
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,400
similar security levels to gift 64.

352
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,359
moreover they identify that plan

353
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,400
representative may achieve comparable

354
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,679
security level against differential and

355
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,360
linear group analysis and its optimal

356
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
effective differential and linear

357
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
characteristics achieves 12 runs

358
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
we donate this equivalence class as gift

359
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
64 2021

360
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,919
this equivalence class contains 24

361
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,120
elements and all variants share the same

362
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,080
differential and linear properties

363
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,880
as in the figure comparing to give the

364
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
6a4 the new variants have comparable

365
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
upper bounds on differential probability

366
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
and linear correlation

367
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,640
the clustering effects of differential

368
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
and linear characteristics are evaluated

369
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,840
similarly to the case of 5th 64th the

370
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,240
differential and linear half properties

371
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,400
of the new variants are not significant

372
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
beyond that we implement the automatic

373
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
search of the impossible differential

374
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
distinguishers their correlation linear

375
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,360
distinguishers and integral

376
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,120
distinguishers for the variance

377
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,919
the experimental results indicate that

378
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,799
the security levels of the variance with

379
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,760
standing in possible differential attack

380
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,480
their correlation linear attack and the

381
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
integral attack are similar to those of

382
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,399
gift 64.

383
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
note that the best attack on new

384
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
violence achieve 18 rounds which is two

385
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,559
rounds less than the length of the best

386
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,120
attack on gift 64

387
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,240
we claim that for the variant if the

388
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
security in the related care tech

389
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,720
setting is not required 26 rounds could

390
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,320
be used rather than 28 rounds

391
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,679
for the simple and clean design strategy

392
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,640
gift offers extremely good performance

393
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,840
and even surpasses both skinny and

394
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,840
salmon for ground-based implementations

395
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,799
as in the table we compare the hardware

396
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,160
performance the new virus achieves hair

397
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
throughput and requires a lower energy

398
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,480
consumption than gift 64.

399
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,320
on this basis the 26 round virus may

400
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,880
become one of the most energy efficient

401
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
servers as of today

402
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
and is

403
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,760
probably more suitable for the lower

404
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,120
energy consumption use cases than give

405
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
64.

406
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,159
now we give a conclusion

407
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,200
the papers that they skip the 64 with

408
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
both automatic methods and mathematical

409
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,240
analysis this hybrid method uncovers new

410
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,000
insights into the security of 54

411
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
and the sum of its variants

412
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,000
forgive 64 we prove some properties of

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
differential characteristics activating

414
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
two x-boxes per round

415
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,520
show that all optimal differential

416
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,159
characteristics takes covering more than

417
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
seven rounds with the maximum

418
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,480
probability can be constructed manually

419
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,240
this has the properties of linear

420
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
characteristics with two active s boxes

421
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,600
per round are also provided

422
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,640
in the second part we find variants with

423
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
analogous security levels

424
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
under the differential and linear

425
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
settings and show that the 26th round

426
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,120
variant may become one of the most

427
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,720
energy efficient steppers as of the day

428
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,039
as to the future work firstly if one is

429
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,919
concerned with related care attack we

430
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,480
conjecture that the resistance of the

431
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
virus regarding related k differential

432
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
attack can be lifted by carefully

433
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
correcting the case schedule

434
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
secondly the cases where the group

435
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,880
mappings operating on different columns

436
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
are distinct is an open problem

437
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,039
lastly checking the existence of a

438
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,880
balanced variance for gift 128

439
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
will be interesting future work

440
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
that's all for the presentation thank

441
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,120
you for your attention
