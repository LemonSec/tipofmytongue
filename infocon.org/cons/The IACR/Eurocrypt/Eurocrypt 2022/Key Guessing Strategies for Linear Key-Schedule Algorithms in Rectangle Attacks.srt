00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,520
hello everyone i'm joy yandong from

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,120
tinghwan university

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,560
i'm talking about key guessing

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,880
strategies for linear case schedule

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,519
algorithms in rectangle attacks

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,320
this work is joined with singularity

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
situation and i'll show you one

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
this report

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,720
how far past the first part includes

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,479
some background and motivations

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,720
boomerang attacks

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
was proposed by winner

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
they built the boomerang distinguisher

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,360
for ed with two short differentials in e

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
and e zero

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,399
suppose

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,040
the probability so even and the ideal

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,160
are p and q the probability of eb will

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,360
be the square of pq

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,239
as boomerang tech needs adaptive

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,280
choosing pretext and subtext

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
thermal improvements are

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
it into chosen playtext attacks

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,199
known as amplified from run on the

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
rectangle attacks

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,320
the probability is reduced by a factor

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,320
of 2 to minus n

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
later many works are proposed to study

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
the probability of pomeran

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
due to the dependency between the two

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
short differentials

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
such as the formula switch sandwich

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,040
attack

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,439
boomerang connected table and its

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,079
improvements

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
in the aspects of the recovery framework

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
or rectangular attack

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,000
we have the following three models

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
when performing

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,600
a related key rectangle with linear key

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
scatter we found

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,720
contrast

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,759
means the input differential alpha

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,799
how to

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
satisfy the following two equations

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
uh to be a right contact

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,240
however

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
they may not hold due to the linear case

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
schedule

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
we introduce a trade-off

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
rectangle attacked by guessing the full

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,879
kb

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
and the partial kf to get more filters

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,640
before

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
generating quarters

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
we build our trade-off model

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
for rectangle text with linear key

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
schedule

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
in algorithm one

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
the first test the app is to

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
collect

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
data

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,200
construct y structure so

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
uh two two rb play text each

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,640
uh fourth structure

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,519
all right

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,040
query the

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,000
uh two two rb play text by encryption

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,879

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,560

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
store them in different

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
tables

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,599
for each of the x bit

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,040

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,760
initialize a key counter

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,839
to the following steps

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
but

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,159
for

91
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,799
p1 in l1

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
we

93
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,400
divide

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,319
the drive is

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,200
uh

96
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
corresponding the

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799

for p3 in l3

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
we found this

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
partner reference partner

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
and

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,319
it's also by encryption

105
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,680
p3 and a plus alpha and then decrypt

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
uh to get p4

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
then restore

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
p1 and p2 in s1

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
indexed by

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
uh

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
indexed by the

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
self text

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,919
and some internal internal base

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,520
this is the sf text and this this is

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,639
some internabies

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
and for a piece

117
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
through mp4

118
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,880
in s2

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
uh

120
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,600
we also

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,600
we also

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,039
compute some internal b

123
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
x3 and s4

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,479
and by decryption from the

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
self tests with some kbs

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
and in a store

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,199
and access

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,800
h

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
to that p1 p2

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
to generate

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
the contours

132
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
then

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,199
for each corners

134
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,160
uh

135
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,840
for each generated contrast we determine

136
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,199
other kbs

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,639
and increase the k encounters

138
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
and we select the top

139
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,000
top piece in the case c

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
and the guest

141
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,520
kb is to check 4k

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
totally we have to

143
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
guess mb plus mf and now cables before

144
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,960
generating the content

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
we guess mb plus m

146
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
f point with k

147
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
to reduce the memory of key quarters

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,520
we guess x b k x before

149
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
initialize k c

150
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
computed the

151
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
expected number of right contacts we

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,759
denoted as as

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
the data complexity is 2

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
is 4y

155
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
2 to rb

156
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,759
we have three times complexities as t1

157
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
t2 and t3

158
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
we will mainly trade off between those

159
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
three time capacity

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
the memory capacity

161
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
includes the key contours and data

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
structure

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,120
we first we apply our model to graph

164
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,319
crop analysis on skinny skinny is

165
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
proposed at

166
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,759
crypto2016

167
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
when skinny adopts the 20k 2k framework

168
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,639
and spn run function

169
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
we have a few

170
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
automatic

171
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840

173
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,520
two recent models combine mlp method and

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,639
cpr stat to determine a good boomerang

175

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,080
based on previous automatic tool

181
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
we build a new model to determine

182
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
optimize the configurations for our

183
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,039
trade-off model

184
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
we have to determine configurations

185
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,520
for

186
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,879
mfm points

187
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,879
hf h

188
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,599
the objective function is to minimize

189
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,479
t1 t2 and d3

190
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,599
the first

191
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
step is to model the propagation of

192
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
cells with known difference in ef

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
we start from this this

194
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
different this

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
this is the end of the distinguisher

196
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,479
and propagate

197
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
from x

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,318
27 to the end

199
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
we introduced some

200
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
binary variables

201
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
such as dxfix and the wfix

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,799
to mark the known differences in

203
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,599
xr or wr

204
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,839
the impact of srn

205
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
sc

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
is determined by this equation and the

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
factor mc

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
is determined by this equation

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,160
we have to model the

210
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
classes

211
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
could be used to filter context in ef

212
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,080
um

213
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
we introduce a banner variables

214
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,200
uh for

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,279
as dx filter uh to denote the

216
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
cells in

217
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
xr which

218
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
can be used to

219
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,320
to be better

220
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
for example

221
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,640
cells always fix the

222
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
difference

223
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
as input

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
to the sc operation then we get the

225
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
unfixed input

226
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
then

227
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
this cell can be used as filter

228
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
we also introduced the dw filter to

229
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
denote

230
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
the filter in depth r

231
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
for example

232
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
uh for example

233
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
there are three uh

234
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,880
three fixed difference

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
in wr and then after mc

236
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,519
there are only one

237
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,839
cell

238
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
and

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
and when we

240
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,599
decryption

241
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,560
we can when computing mc inverse

242
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,680
we have two actual

243
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,640
cells

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
in wr

245
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,320
with fixed differences as filters

246
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
before generating quarters

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
we have to guess

248
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
partial cells to gain more uh filters we

249
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
divide the x gas and detect the gas

250
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,920
variables

251
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
we know the cells in wr need to know uh

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,839
includes

253
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,839
known cells from xr and filters in wr

254
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
cells in x r plus one need to know

255
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,279
includes no cells from wr and filters in

256
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
wxr

257
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
plus one

258
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,720
we also model the advantage h

259
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
the objective function is to minimize

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
divide t2 and t3

261
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
we found new boomerang distinguishers

262
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,279
for cellular versions so

263
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
scanning for example od texting ratio

264
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,839
for skinny

265
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,720
128 to

266
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
384 which is

267
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
24 or 20

268
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,640
23 rounds per which is inferred to

269
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
uh previous

270
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,480
24 25 wrong stitching ratio but we can

271
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,600
perform

272
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
a 32 rounds kill recovery attack

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,479
which gives two more runs

274
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,880
we add foreign eb and the federal ef

275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,600
to the uh 23a round distinguisher

276
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
uh in

277
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
uh zero points uh we collect uh the

278
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
plate up

279
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,959
structures

280
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,920
and they

281
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
they

282
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
they

283
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
say

284
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,399
3y

285
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
act as subtext

286
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
then

287
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,040
rb

288
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,720
is

289
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,440
12c and the mb is 18 c

290
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
rf is

291
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,000
16c and mf is 24c

292
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
but our automatic tool will determine

293
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
the key sales

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,519
should be guessed in advance as key f

295
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
point and

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
we get filter

297
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,760
as hive

298
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,160
recite as s1 h as 40 mx as

299
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
208

300
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
and we get a balance between t1 t2 and

301
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,920
t3 the final time is about

302
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
2 to

303
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
35

304
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
5.

305
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,240
we also applied to a model to fork

306
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
skinny and

307
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
access

308
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,760
pc and gate

309
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
our model can also be applied to single

310
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,320
case setting and give

311
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,240
we give an example

312
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
application to servant

313
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
we compared

314
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,760
those key recovery models as follows

315
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,639
before ordinary quarters

316
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
in attack 1

317
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,639
they guess

318
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,760
mb and

319
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
mf bit

320
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
k at once

321
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
in attack 2 we do not guess 10k

322
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,480
in attacks rate

323
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,279
we get only mp in ep and our model

324
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
and all model

325
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,079
gas is handy and partial

326
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
case

327
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
yes

328
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,920
so thanks for your attention

329
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
you
