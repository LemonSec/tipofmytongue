1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
all right so our final talk of the

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,920
session and uh actually a final talk of

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
the conference is

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,760
secure non-interactive reduction and

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,560
spectral analysis of correlations and

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,600
varun uh nerium will give the talk

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
thanks

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,880
thank you jeremiah

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
hi everybody thank you for sticking

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,920
around

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,559
uh my name is varun narayanan and this

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
talk would be dealing with the same

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,480
model that i presented in the previous

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,000
talk

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,960
so we call it

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
secure non-interactive reductions

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
not spectre

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,600
so let me begin by

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
introducing the main object of interest

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
here is our

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
correlations specifically alice and bob

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
would be getting two parts of the

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,800
correlation

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,199
let's say random variables x and y are

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,680
distributed according to a correlation c

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
that is distributed over the domain x

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,799
cross y now throughout

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,600
this presentation we would be denoting a

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,920
correlation by its probability mass

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,799
matrix probability distribution matrix

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
so here

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
the

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
value at the exit row and yth column of

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,799
this matrix will represent the

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
probability with which

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
x is going to be equal to x and y is

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,000
going to be equal to y we can think of x

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
and y as numbers

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
yeah so

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
a good example of a correlation is a

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
binary erasure correlation

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
so here

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
as shown in the figure here

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,159
alice would be getting x uniformly at

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,200
random

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,799
and bob will be getting

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,079
the same x as y y equal to x with

48
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
probability one minus p

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
but with probability p y would be erased

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,319
so

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
the correlation distribution made the

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,239
probability distribution matrix for the

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,840
same would be

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
like this

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,239
so

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,480
this column corresponds to the symbol 0

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
this corresponds to the symbol bot

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
1 and so on and so on

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,000
now

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
when p is equal to half that is all

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
these numbers are 1 by

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,160
1 by 4 this corresponds to the rabin

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
oblivious transfer correlation

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
and classical results show that if

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
alice and bob have sufficiently many

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
copies of the rabin ot correlation they

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,040
can compute any function with security

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
so to motivate our

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,879
problem let's consider the following

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,239
situation alice and bob have a binary

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,000
ratio correlation with them

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
with erasure probability p but p is not

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,640
exactly equal to half

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,680
and what they would like to do is

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
somehow derive

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,159
the ot correlation rabinotic correlation

77
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
by going from erasure probability p to a

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
ratio probability half

79
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
now they would like to do this without

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
interacting with each other so alice

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
wants to locally transform their side of

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,599
the correlation

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,159
by running some function some

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
potentially randomized function a on x

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
to get r

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,599
and bob would like to do the same b of y

87
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,959
equal to s

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,599
and they would like to have r and s

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,840
correlated according to this erasure

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,879
probability half correlation

91
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,959
so

92
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,480
of course they would like to do this

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920
securely so that they can use this as a

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
sub protocol in their bigger secure

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
information secure multi-party

96
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
computation protocol

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,959
so let's see a potential protocol that

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
might even work so

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
here alice simply outputs whatever she

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
gets

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
and bob

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
bob will

103
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,200
take their input and

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,358
further erase it with a certain

105
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,680
probability specifically

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
we can choose this probability to be 2

107
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,160
times 1 minus p

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,080
below 1.

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,639
and indeed if they follow this

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
particular scheme

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
whenever p is less than half they indeed

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
get r and s to be correctly correlated

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
but this is not secure why is this not

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
secure

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,199
because

116
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,440
in the rabin ot whenever

117
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,759
bob receives a bot

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
they have no idea

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
they have no

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
guess about

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
what value x could have been

122
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,720
but over here note that

123
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
bob is sometimes getting an actual

124
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,280
symbol that's either zero or one and

125
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
then it is reporting an erasure

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
so in that specific instance uh the

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
security breaks

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
so let's try the another attempt here

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,599
we'll use two copies of

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,960
the binary razor slash p

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
and then uh

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
alice is going to xor x1 and x2 and bob

133
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
is also going to do the same as long as

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
y and y1 and y2 are

135
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
valid not non-erasers

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,520
and whenever either one of these are

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
erasers they output a bot

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
and here things are secure why is this

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
secure because if if both these

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
messages are

141
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
non-bought that is belong to 0 and 1

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
then alice and bob are going to output

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,199
the same value because x 1 x or x 2

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
equal to y 1 x or y 2

145
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280
but when either one of these is bought

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
then bob has no idea what alice's output

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
is because it it's pretty much masked by

148
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,440
the

149
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
input that is not known to bob

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
but something to note here is that

151
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,240
interestingly in the attempt one we get

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
correctness but not security but this

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,120
works for any p that is less than half

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,759
by appropriately choosing this quantity

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,520
with the probability with which we

156
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
further erase

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
but here we are using two copies and

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
somehow we are only able to move from uh

159
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
p is equal to one minus one by root two

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
two p is equal to half and this is a

161
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,520
property that we will see going forward

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
too

163
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
so how would we define our model in

164
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,800
general

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
and

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,639
going back to how i began the talk

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
the model that we will be dealing with

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,280
is the same as what i had mentioned we

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
would be focusing on general

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
correlations and we are interested in

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,639
presenting a linear algebraic way of

172
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,360
analyzing this particular model so

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
secure non-interactive reduction

174
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,639
alice and bob get x and y correlated

175
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,479
according to a correlation c

176
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,560
and they want to locally

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,520
apply

178
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
a potentially randomized

179
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,960
function to their input to derive r and

180
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
this respectively

181
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
and as we noticed when security is not a

182
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
concern we just want rns to be

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
correlated appropriately

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
according to the distribution the d that

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
is the d is the distribution that we

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
want to derive from c

187
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
but

188
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
in terms of secure non-interactive

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
detection these functions a and b are

190
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
said to be an s n ir or secure

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,240
non-interactive direction of the target

192
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,759
distribution d to the source

193
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,199
distribution c

194
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
if firstly r and s given here are

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,280
distributed according to the coalition d

196
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
and

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,879
then we have the security conditions the

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,319
security conditions are the natural

199
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
security conditions alice's view should

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,919
not reveal what bob's output is and

201
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,360
bob's view should not reveal what

202
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,440
alice's output is but note that here

203
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,919
alice's view

204
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,520
is just x

205
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,560
that alice got from the correlation so

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
it simply translates to

207
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,919
so this is security against bob or

208
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,120
alice's security cons guarantee it says

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,479
that al bob's view which is why

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,560
does not reveal anything about alice's

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,120
output r conditioned on

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
his own output so r should be

213
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
independent of y condition on s

214
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
similarly s should be independent of

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,559
x which is alice's view condition on r

216
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
so the fundamental question that we ask

217
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
is when can

218
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
a correlation d

219
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,120
have an snir to another correlation c

220
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
so in this work we will be seeing an

221
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
a linear algebraic tool which we call

222
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,160
the spectral analysis toolkit to analyze

223
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
statistical snir this is something that

224
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
we will come into in the next slide

225
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,959
itself

226
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
in some detail

227
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,880
and we will use this toolkit to obtain

228
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,760
exact characterization of scenarios

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
between interesting classes of

230
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,519
correlations and these interesting class

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,000
of correlations coincide with highest

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
presentation

233
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,519
so why study snir we we

234
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
got motivated to study s and i are

235
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
coming from a slightly different point

236
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
of view than high date high at all date

237
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,320
so

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
so correlations are a fundamental

239
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
uh

240
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
tool in information theoretic

241
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,560
cryptography as we noticed with the

242
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
rabinoti

243
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,399
we can use correlations to

244
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,440
promote

245
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
or facilitate secure computation

246
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
now

247
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,160
snir is in in the sense the most basic

248
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
cryptographic question that we can ask

249
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
about correlations can we securely

250
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
derive a correlation from another

251
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
furthermore we can think of snir as a

252
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,959
non-interactive variant of

253
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
general secure

254
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,399
computation

255
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
and we know that lower bound for secure

256
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
computation is a deep

257
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
complexity theory question which has

258
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
connections to circuit complexity and

259
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
pir complexity and so on

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
so in that sense this is an easier

261
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
question that we do not know the answer

262
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
for

263
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,079
furthermore

264
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,760
if we think of a secure computation

265
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
between correlations as in take a

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
correlation and obtain another

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
correlation

268
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
in that case uh

269
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
a interactive protocol itself splits

270
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,760
into two phases there's an initial

271
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
interaction phase in which alice and bob

272
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
exchange messages with each other and in

273
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,560
this phase there is no

274
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,360
necessity for a security and then in the

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
final phase where alice and bob have

276
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
this correlated view that they have

277
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
developed over this communication

278
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
from that they want to obtain the

279
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
correlation that they are interested in

280
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
so this is in a sense a

281
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
you know a local derivation a secure

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,399
non-interactive reduction from

283
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
the output that you want back to the

284
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,320
the view that you have generated so far

285
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,279
so

286
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,079
so in short secure computation with

287
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,320
interaction has

288
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
security uh

289
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,959
concentrated only in the snir phase of

290
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,160
the specific protocol

291
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,440
furthermore

292
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
there is an entire area of

293
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,160
non-interactive correlation simulation

294
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,399
which is the same problem as that we

295
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,920
discussed without the security

296
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,800
constraint and this is studied rather

297
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,920
extensively in

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
theoretical computer science and in

299
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
information theory and this is the

300
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
natural secure variant of this

301
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
particular notion

302
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
and there are a

303
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,880
recent

304
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
series of works on pseudo-random

305
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,959
correlation generation where alice and

306
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
bob would

307
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,480
take a pair of small correlated seeds

308
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,040
and they will expand it to

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
a larger

310
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
correlation securely but the security is

311
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,040
computational of course in that setting

312
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,560
and this can be thought of as the

313
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
information theoretical variant of the

314
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,959
same

315
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
so what are our results

316
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
uh

317
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
so we asked the question when can we do

318
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
status equals an ir from a

319
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,519
from a target distribution d to a source

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,880
distribution c

321
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
and we say that a

322
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
protocol a comma b

323
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,120
is an

324
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
a statistical snir

325
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,480
under certain conditions so let me

326
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
back off a little bit so what is

327
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
statistical scenario so our results

328
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,079
would be presented as necessary

329
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,279
conditions

330
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
for the weakest notion of sni r that we

331
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,639
could uh formulate so the weakest notion

332
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,839
is we just want one copy of the target

333
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
distribution d to be obtained using

334
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
arbitrarily many copies of the source

335
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,560
distribution c

336
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,839
but with the error in the secure

337
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,040
reduction

338
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,760
uh driven to zero with more and more

339
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
potentially more and more copies of c

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
so in this setting

341
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
we show that it's sufficient to look at

342
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
correlations without any redundant

343
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
symbols by this we mean that

344
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,639
so two symbols on alice's side in the

345
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
correlation is said to be redundant if

346
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
condition on both these symbols the

347
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
output at bob looks the same

348
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,399
so it's easy to argue that we can

349
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,760
merge or split redundant symbols

350
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,480
in pre and post processing without any

351
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
concerns about security so we can

352
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
essentially

353
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
settle for looking at only correlations

354
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
without redundant symbols

355
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
further an important observation that

356
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
hai also makes

357
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
is that

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
an snar

359
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
protocol

360
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
involves only deterministic functions

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
the both a and b in this instance can be

362
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
thought of essentially as deterministic

363
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,199
functions

364
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,000
then

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
our main necessary condition says that

366
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
the so-called spectrum of a correlation

367
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
d has to be contained inside the

368
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
spectrum of the correlation c now we

369
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
will see uh this notion of spectrum uh

370
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
which is like the name of the type the

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,199
title of the

372
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
talk so this is about spectral analysis

373
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,959
of uh this particular model so

374
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
and in in the spectral analysis we'll

375
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
say that if we take this

376
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,440
if the look at this

377
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
protocol in the spectral domain then

378
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
this turn out to be symmetric in the

379
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
sense that both alice and bob are

380
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
essentially doing the same operation in

381
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
some sense

382
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,079
finally uh common information that is

383
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,600
present in the source correlation does

384
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
not really help in

385
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,079
you know snir

386
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
so common information is something that

387
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,399
alice and bob can agree on with

388
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,240
probability one by looking at just the

389
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
correlation and as intuition suggests

390
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,680
you can't get any security from

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,959
these kind of information that is

392
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,760
present at both places

393
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,800
so as an application of our toolkit we

394
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,199
get exact characterization for the

395
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
statistical scenario for interesting

396
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
classes of correlations

397
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,160
and as we saw uh highs

398
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,480
in in high stock

399
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,800
the previous

400
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,199
paper presented does a more fine-grained

401
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
analysis for special classes of

402
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
correlations the same pretty much the

403
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,040
same things that we are looking at and

404
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,839
for that they get results for the rates

405
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,160
as well as feasibility

406
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
okay so

407
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,320
to formally define uh

408
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
so am i running low on time

409
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
you've got a couple more minutes a

410
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,120
couple more minutes oh okay

411
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
okay so uh the security uh and

412
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,079
correctness of snir is defined in the

413
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,599
formal way that is

414
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,600
you know the usual way that you define

415
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,680
security in the uc setting and here

416
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,839
there is no difference between

417
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,600
the semi honest and malicious because

418
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
nobody is talking in the protocol

419
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,519
and

420
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,360
the first observation that we make is

421
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,680
that we can move from

422
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
status

423
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,560
a

424
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,360
definition in terms of simulation and

425
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,959
correctness we can move to a

426
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,120
an equivalent

427
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
set of conditions that is described

428
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
entirely in uh linear algebraic

429
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
constraints so we can say that

430
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
corresponding to the protocols a and b

431
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,240
there are statist stochastic matrices a

432
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,360
and b

433
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
and with respect to the matrices for

434
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
correlation

435
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,000
uh

436
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
correlation matrices c and d

437
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
we have correctness written as

438
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,799
a particular matrix product being close

439
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,480
to uh

440
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,599
the the

441
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,119
desired correlation

442
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,039
and the security at alice would

443
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,480
correspond to having a simulator u

444
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,400
uh which assimilate a sim sub a which

445
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,599
corresponds to a stochastic matrix u and

446
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,760
we get another matrix multiplication

447
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,439
constraint and so on

448
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,400
so our analysis begins with uh this

449
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,640
linear algebraic characterization

450
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
so these

451
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
matrices are nothing surprising so for

452
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
example

453
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,679
the matrix a corresponding to alice's uh

454
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,960
in a function a is just the matrix

455
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
with except row and r

456
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
columns value being the probability with

457
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,760
which r

458
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,640
is output condition on x as input by

459
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
this function a

460
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
so the first observation that we make is

461
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,679
that snir is essentially deterministic

462
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,720
yeah we've given a snir with an epsilon

463
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
error we can always move to

464
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
another snir with a slightly larger

465
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
error

466
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,880
uh in which both the functions uh used

467
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,520
are deterministic functions

468
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
now uh

469
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
so yeah um

470
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
so let's look at

471
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
uh

472
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
what we can get with this kind of

473
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
observation so going back here

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
once we show that a and b are

475
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,080
deterministic we can also show that the

476
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
simulators have a very simple and direct

477
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,720
representation in terms of the protocol

478
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,280
itself whenever this is secure

479
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
so now using these facts that a and b

480
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,840
are deterministic and that the

481
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
simulators are completely determined by

482
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,919
the protocols themselves in a very

483
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,360
direct way we can show that

484
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,320
this quantity that is a transpose c c

485
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
transpose is equal to d d transpose into

486
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,679
a transpose

487
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,559
it's a linear algebraic inequality and

488
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,520
then

489
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
uh by simply observing that

490
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
you can do some simple manipulations uh

491
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,600
we can show that if d transpose d has an

492
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
eigenvalue

493
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,280
then that eigenvalue should also be

494
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
present in c transpose

495
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
c

496
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,320
and this is exactly the spectral

497
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
condition that we were talking about

498
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
specifically for uh these kind of simple

499
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
matrices

500
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
that is simple correlations so for the

501
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
simple correlations the spectral

502
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
containment exactly means that the

503
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
eigenvalues of d transpose d is a subset

504
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,880
of the eigenvalues of c transpose c

505
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
so this already

506
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,799
can be used rather directly to show that

507
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,799
simple correlations

508
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,799
like bse and bc

509
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,919
have

510
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,200
snir

511
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,000
amongst itself that is a snir from a

512
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,039
bscq to a bacp for example can only

513
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,679
occur when p and q are related in this

514
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,280
very special sense that for example over

515
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,880
here 1 minus 2 p is equal to 1 minus 2 q

516
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
4 a certain fixed value of q

517
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,159
and the constructions here turn out to

518
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,720
be rather simple and straightforward

519
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,520
now

520
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
uh

521
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,480
so

522
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
the the observation that we made

523
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,120
is for very specific and structured

524
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
correlations in which

525
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,520
the marginals are uniform and uh

526
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,760
the the correlations itself have like

527
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,679
the same domain size on both alice and

528
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,080
bob's side but when we want to

529
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,720
generalize it to

530
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
you know arbitrary correlations

531
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,400
uh the object that turns out to be

532
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
of interest is not exactly the

533
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
correlation matrix but the so-called

534
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
correlation operator matrix

535
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
so it is the correlation operator matrix

536
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
itself can be computed as

537
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,720
a

538
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,320
the correlation matrix pre and post

539
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,919
multiplied by

540
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,640
the diagonal matrix corresponding to the

541
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
marginal of the correlation on alice and

542
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,158
bob's side

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,799
and the interesting thing about the

544
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,799
correlation operator is that when we

545
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,080
take the svd of this operator it shows a

546
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,720
lot of properties

547
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
that

548
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,880
have

549
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,400
that have been found to be meaningful in

550
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,960
previous analysis of the correlations

551
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
so

552
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,240
i hope that everybody knows singular

553
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
value decomposition it is essentially

554
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
talking about

555
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,120
how much the matrix

556
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,600
expands any vector along the different

557
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
directions

558
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
yeah

559
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,600
so

560
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,600
um

561
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,720
so in in the general setting for an

562
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
arbitrary correlation

563
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
the spectrum of the correlation turns

564
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,360
out to be exactly the singular values of

565
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
this correlation operator

566
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
and that is specifically the non-zero

567
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,039
singular values of this correlation

568
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,080
operator

569
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
and

570
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,799
yeah just to uh give an idea about what

571
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,000
we mean by

572
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
correlation operator so when we look at

573
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,679
the spectrum of this correlation

574
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,919
operator we will see that they fall in

575
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,520
this

576
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
interval between 0 and 1

577
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,960
and the second largest value of this is

578
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
the maximal correlation in fact the

579
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,039
correlation

580
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,120
the spectrum of a correlation is closely

581
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,039
related to

582
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,000
the

583
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,360
so

584
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
several spectral graph theoretic

585
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,159
quantities

586
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,240
uh related to the bipartite graph

587
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,600
representing the correlation

588
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,799
yeah so and another nice

589
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,200
property of the uh

590
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
the spectrum of a correlation is that

591
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
if i take like n copies of this

592
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,880
correlation the spectrum of that would

593
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,360
be just an n-wise product of this and

594
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,080
we our analysis is mostly based on first

595
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
going from the linear algebra

596
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,039
constraints that we had for snir to a

597
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,880
spectral domain

598
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,159
and over there uh realizing a lot of

599
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
structures and showing that

600
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,000
because of the structure we can show a

601
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
an inclusion of the spectrum of d in

602
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
that of c and

603
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
showing that the protocols for a and

604
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
protocols 4b in the spectral domain they

605
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
have a mirroring property

606
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
and

607
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,919
very interestingly

608
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,440
with some

609
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
painstaking analysis you can show that

610
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,200
these properties uh are robust to errors

611
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
in the sense that when we go for epsilon

612
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,039
error in the snir these properties only

613
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,840
vary in a more in a natural way or only

614
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,039
fluctuate in the most natural way

615
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,559
so yeah so

616
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,559
the the kind of results that we get for

617
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,159
this exact correlations uh coincide with

618
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,559
that in uh highest result

619
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,000
so other results uh

620
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,120
we we also show the in we also show

621
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,919
impossibility for more uh larger

622
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,000
correlations uh

623
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,440
like ole and ot and so on

624
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
and we can also show that s and i are

625
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,799
cannot be done using only a single type

626
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,559
of correlation for example we cannot use

627
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,480
a single type of correlation to get all

628
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
sorts of

629
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,720
correlations in this model

630
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,159
um

631
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,159
yeah finally we show that

632
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
common information is not

633
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,919
useful

634
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,000
in this model

635
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,279
so to conclude we used a spectral

636
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,400
analysis

637
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,679
to reveal

638
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,000
a lot of structure in sni

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
and we characterize sniper for a lot of

640
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
natural correlations

641
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
and an interesting question that is left

642
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
open is the question of decidability

643
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,279
that is can i get

644
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,520
a correlation from another correlation

645
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,799
in this model

646
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,960
and we settle this question in an

647
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
upcoming follow-up work

648
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,320
and

649
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,440
the main

650
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
open questions

651
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,600
of interest are one of them is rate in

652
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,480
which uh the previous paper made some

653
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
interesting advance

654
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,799
and

655
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
uh the decidability when you allow like

656
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,240
let's say one directional communication

657
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
all right

658
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
that's awesome thank you

659
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,480
[Applause]

660
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
all right uh thanks are there any

661
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,799
questions uh

662
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,720
if you have a question please come to

663
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,880
the microphone

664
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,520
okay it's working that's great very

665
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
elegant love this talk love this result

666
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,279
thank you i have a general question

667
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,679
about the reductions basically and um

668
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,919
most of what you have analyzed uh looks

669
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,960
at primarily independence among results

670
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
like a's result is essentially

671
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
independent of b

672
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
uh conditioned on b's outputs yeah this

673
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,039
is the security notion

674
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,960
yeah and and that actually has a lot of

675
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,799
relevance when you look at say quantum

676
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,960
protocols and even in privacy

677
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
amplification kind of results and when

678
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,120
you relate them to uh simulatable

679
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,120
simulatability and or you see proofs

680
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
okay um and the aspect of that that i

681
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,480
wanted to ask you about is that it is

682
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,080
possible in some of these cases for

683
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
alice to have something that is

684
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,760
independent of bob's result

685
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,880
but still somehow bound by bob's results

686
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,799
so there are middle aspects of this as

687
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,640
well so these are concerns in the

688
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,520
quantum

689
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
realm because of entanglements and so on

690
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,000
for example in the quantum that's that's

691
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
a very good concrete example indeed yeah

692
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
it does in fact happen in classical we

693
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
were curious about exactly how this

694
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,080
particular tool uh goes through in

695
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,279
more general models but we

696
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
we didn't quite

697
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
uh make enough connections about what

698
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,919
this this particular spectral operator

699
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,559
or the correlation operator is

700
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,880
with respect to other domains but yeah

701
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
this is an interesting injection okay

702
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
thanks and the half of it that was just

703
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
a motivational thing but the half of it

704
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,279
that that's

705
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,640
that i wanted to ask which i think

706
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
you're answering is that the binding

707
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,799
nature of the outputs where alice's

708
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,720
output is bound by bob's but still

709
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
independent information theoretically of

710
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,840
it isn't something that you really

711
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,039
covered so far

712
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,960
okay and and is maybe open in this

713
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
thanks thank you

714
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,360
all right uh so we have a message uh

715
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,760
from our program chair to close out the

716
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,720
conference uh but let's uh quick give a

717
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,080
round of applause for all the speakers

718
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,380
of the session

719
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,240
[Applause]

720
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
i just wanted to thank you again

721
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
me

722
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,399
so this was the last

723
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,320
talk of this session and the last talk

724
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
of the conference i wanted to thank you

725
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,880
again for coming and again thank

726
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,559
all the authors of

727
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,520
of the papers and see you in a year in

728
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,399
lyon thank you
