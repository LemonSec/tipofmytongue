1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,080
and the next

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,720
the next talk will be given online

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,640
it's about optimal tightness for

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,320
train-based unique signatures and the

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,200
speaker is fuchung

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
hello everyone uh my name is fujingwoo

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
and i'm presenting from australia

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
the title of our paper is optimal

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
tetanus for chain-based unix changes

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,119
this work is joined with with we are

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,519
both from the university of wolongo

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
in this work we focus on this question

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
how to program a data deduction for a

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
single scheme when signatures are unique

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,760
meaning without using random numbers in

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,719
signature generations

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
security production is a popular method

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
for security proof and security

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,360
deduction supports that yes an adversary

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,199
who can break a skin

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,239
way

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,320
reduce breaking the skin to solving a

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
heart problem

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
a security reduction is tight if an

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
adversary can break the skin with time

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
course t and probability if strong and

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,799
we can solve the heart problem with a

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
very close time cost and probability

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
a title deduction guarantees that

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
breaking the skin is as difficult as

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,320
solving a heart problem

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,159
digital signatures are fundamental

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,960
primitive in modern cryptography

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
how to construct a single scheme with a

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
tighter deduction received loss of

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
attention in the little ritual

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,840
our community has also invented many

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
intelligent methods for tighter security

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
proof

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
with the efforts from our community it's

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
no longer hard to obtain tata deductions

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
if it's in a weak security model or if

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
it's under an interactive hardness

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,719
assumption or adversary with

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,119
restrictions in computations like the

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,399
agm

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,159
the research question is narrowed down

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,880
to

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
how to have a title reduction and the

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
light interactive assumption in standard

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,840
security model against general

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,640
adversaries

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
nowadays it's also not hard

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,599
to

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,520
achieve tighter reductions with these

56
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
three factors as long as signatures are

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
randomized

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
in the standard screw model

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
we must simulate some signatures for the

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
adversary before we receive a fresh

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,239
feature

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,160
the high level idea of title reduction

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
using the randomized approach works as

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
this

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
since there are at least two valid

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
signatures for each message we program

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
the simulation in the way left while

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
signatures is simulatable means can we

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
simulate and the other signatures are

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
reducible means can be reduced

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
to solving hard problems

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
then when the atmosphere cured the

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
signatures of message mi we returned a

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
signature for it

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
then let's not abort in signature theory

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
and the force signature is reduceable

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
with high probability

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
a consequent question is

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,599
how to have a title reduction with these

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
three factors but without using the

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,120
gender might approach

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
this question is interesting because

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,080
unique signatures are special signatures

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
where each message has only one very

85
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
significant such as the well-known brs

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
signature scheme proposed 20 years ago

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
learn randomized approach cannot be

88
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,680
applied to have taken reduction for unit

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
changes because there's only one very

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,400
signature for each message

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
the consequent thinking is is it

92
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
possible or not to have a title

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,159
deduction for a unique change scheme

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,840
well it seems impossible if all

95
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
simulations have a common feature as

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
this

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,159
and at the right we can choose some

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
message make a basic consequence before

99
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,560
signature qas and signature 4g such that

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
the switch on each message is

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
simulatable or reducible and this kind

102
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,358
of reduction cannot be changed by the

103
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,720
simulator

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
it's impossible because the atomizer can

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,720
attack initially

106
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
the adversary will first pick a message

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
and make theories such that all

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
signatures

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,280
are either simulatable or reduceable

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
length the adversary will pick q random

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,280
of learn for signature queries and forge

112
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
the signature of the last message

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
denoted by m star if there are two

114
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
signatures are reducible then definitely

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
the simulation will not be successful

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
because q signatures must be simulatable

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,080
and if there's only one signature

118
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
reducible

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,160
the probability is at most one over q

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
because of some kind of drainage choice

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
by the adversity

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
there have been many excellent proofs

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
with meta reduction showing that unix

124
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,240
signatures or their generalizations

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
cannot have success probability more

126
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
than one over q in the standard

127
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
experiment

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
on the other hand it's also possible to

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
achieve tender reduction

130
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
we with the other four co-authors show

131
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,120
how to do this in crypto 17.

132
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,199
the proposing scheme is called chain

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,720
based construction

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
each unique signature is composed of and

135
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,199
block changes locate sigma 1 to sigma n

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,600
the key point is the signing structure

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
like the blockchain

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
the proximity just capital sigma and 0

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,280
are treated as message and sign to

140
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,520
attend capital signal m1

141
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,479
and capital system and y are treated as

142
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,039
message and sign again to obtain the

143
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,159
sigma m2

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
in the secure reduction for this single

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
scheme and adversary can still choose

146
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
message and make hashiky rats such that

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
signatures on each message is still

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,440
either simulatable or reduced but

149
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
the simulator has already solved heart

150
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
problems from heart injuries in general

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
model

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
so how can the simulator solve the hard

153
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
problems with a high security

154
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,360
in the secure proof

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,319
each signature query each signature

156
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,960
request and different hashi queues

157
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
called from type 0 type 1 type 2 to type

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
n minus 1

159
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
and before the signature queue on

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,680
message m

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,520
the attribute should

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,400
make type 0 query first then type 1 and

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
then type 2 sequentially this is because

164
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,759
of the chain structure

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,560
the attribution must compute

166
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
locate sigma i by itself

167
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,759
for type i query

168
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,880
which is some kind of computation ha

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
without knowing the secret key

170
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,479
so given a cbs permissions the prover

171
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,120
can set the secret key equal to a and

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,080
program the response to type i mas1

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
curing with g2b

174
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,039
learnt

175
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,080
the type i curate from the adversary

176
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
will contain lowercase sigma i

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,440
which is the solution to the cdh problem

178
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
the challenge of titan reduction is that

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,160
we don't know how many queries for each

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,479
message the adversary we are curing

181
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,919
before it's changed the number ki

182
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
for message mr is definitely decided by

183
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
the adversary of course if the aws would

184
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
like to forge the signature of message m

185
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
start

186
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
it must make or end curious

187
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,759
um and start

188
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
an important finding in crypto17 is that

189
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
that capital qi to be the number of all

190
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,759
type iq is generated by adverse rate

191
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
no matter how the adversary curates

192
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
there must exist a special integer i

193
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,960
star such that qi star and q as the plus

194
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,759
one

195
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
is very close

196
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
it means that the rate is as small as

197
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
one over q h to power one over n and q h

198
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
is the number of passive theories

199
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,680
with this important finding the proverb

200
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
choose uh can choose one of type extra q

201
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,559
rays and respond to it with c to b

202
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,958
and then the cbh solution will appear in

203
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,640
one of type i star plus one queries with

204
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
a very high probability which is equal

205
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,839
to this

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
currently uh

207
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
there's a only one method for proving

208
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
techniques of unix changes

209
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,560
which

210
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,000
was appeared

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
in crypto17 and the reduction loss is

212
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
this which is lock-tight

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
and least

214
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,959
the contribution uh in this workout

215
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
we first show that the optional optimal

216
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
loss is q to power of n and q is the

217
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
number of signal curious

218
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
and we show how to obtain such an

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,959
optimal reduction

220
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
we introduce the second contribution

221
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
first

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
our proof for chain base uh bigger

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
scheme works as this without chaining

224
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
the scheme okay uh having the series

225
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
performance we set our secret key equal

226
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,519
to a the key point is that we

227
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,519
non-uniformly choose an integer c from

228
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,200
the range

229
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,160
0 to minus 1 for each message

230
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
then we plan

231
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,959
to

232
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,480
send the response to type i type c

233
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
curates as the change qa are equal to c

234
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,200
and this that this bones has the g2b

235
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,760
and other queries are

236
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,720
normal curious without t to be in the

237
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
response

238
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
okay

239
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
then suppose the adverse makes a type 0

240
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
type 1 to type k of m before signature

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
queries we have these kinds of redux

242
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
if k

243
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,800
is less than c it means that the

244
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,240
attribution has not yet cured the type c

245
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
q a message m

246
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,279
and

247
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,079
no we can change uh or we just set or

248
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
curate to normal curates it means then

249
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,120
we can simulate the signatures okay some

250
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
kind of change here

251
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
and if k is c we have to abort because

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,920
we cannot simulate the signature but if

253
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,279
k is larger than c then the half percent

254
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,760
has already appeared in type c plus one

255
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,079
period

256
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
we consider the simple case

257
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,320
that the antivirus will make one central

258
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,279
theory before the singular tree okay now

259
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
something big has appeared here

260
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,000
the success probability is equal to next

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
the probability of solving

262
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,079
compliment

263
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,440
before signature queries plus something

264
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
happened from the first signature well

265
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
there's no success or not about

266
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,040
uh in

267
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
signature theory phase okay

268
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,360
so p s

269
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
i one denotes the

270
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
soft uh problem before signature query

271
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,680
and p f denote the failure probability

272
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,800
due to signature periods

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,880
the key question is how to have a high

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
success probability e

275
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
this page is the most important showing

276
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
the key solution in our work

277
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
here pr is the

278
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,079
is the probability

279
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,200
if p

280
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
s star is closed

281
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
and no more than one over two and the

282
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,760
gap between p f one and p s one

283
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
is constant and small for example as

284
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,920
small as one over q

285
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,800
learn after one signature curious the

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,399
success probability

287
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,519
is slightly reduced only okay

288
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,560
one

289
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
minus one over q

290
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
we can extend this to q signature q is

291
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
not lost eventually

292
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
is the constant and small

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,639
okay but how to achieve this

294
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,639
we found this can be achieved with

295
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,200
geometric progression

296
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,399
suppose p f i is equal to 1 over 2 to

297
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,680
power j and psi is equal to the sum of

298
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,519
all values

299
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
on the left side

300
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,240
of

301
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
1 over 2 to the power j then no matter

302
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,040
what j is

303
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,320
the gap between pfi and psi is always

304
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
equal to 1 over

305
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
2 to the power n plus 1 and we can set

306
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,920
this value very close to 1 over q

307
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,639
and the sum of all values is close and

308
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,160
no more than one over two

309
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
so our proof work as it follows for each

310
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
message m there will be n types of hashi

311
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
q a's

312
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
and we will choose a very special

313
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,200
c and not uniformly

314
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,480
and

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
c to b will be embedded in response to

316
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
type c q with a different probability

317
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
from 1 over 2 to n plus 1 to 1 over 2 to

318
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
2.

319
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,079
suppose the edible we are making type 0

320
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,800
type 1 type k curate on matching m

321
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,279
before signature q is that we will have

322
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,360
different results

323
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,720
we have introduced this previously

324
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
so

325
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
we have uh

326
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
this uh important probabilities

327
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
we have pfi

328
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,720
when

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
c to power b

330
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
uh is embedded in response to type ki

331
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,480
curates on message mi and we have psi

332
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
when t2b is embedded in response to any

333
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,360
type

334
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,959
ci as long as ci is uh

335
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
less than ki okay

336
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
ki is a definitively chosen by adversary

337
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
yes but no matter what ki is we have the

338
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,920
gap of this two probability is always

339
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,880
equal to one over two to n plus 1

340
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,959
and for the fourth signatures

341
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,360
the other version must make all curious

342
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
and p star is

343
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
is very close to one over two

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
and this is the main idea of our

345
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
category

346
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
with the the above approach

347
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
we can prove that the chain based field

348
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
scheme will have the reduction loss

349
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,720
4 times q to the power 1 over n and this

350
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,440
loss is constant and small when n is

351
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,399
locked in q okay and next we show that

352
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,320
this kind of reduction loss must be at

353
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
least q to power one over n

354
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,760
we use the framework of method reduction

355
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
by a current

356
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,959
to analyze these kinds of optimal loss

357
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
we first should construct a special

358
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
hypothetic adversary

359
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,199
and then

360
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,519
we need to simulate this kind of

361
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,839
hypothetical adversary by

362
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,079
rewinding if we can efficiently simulate

363
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,000
distance of atmosphere with error

364
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
probability epsilon e

365
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,959
then

366
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,480
the r

367
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
will break the hardness of transfer with

368
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,839
epsilon r minus epsilon

369
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,959
e the meta deduction shows that if r

370
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,199
cannot be larger than x of e

371
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,720
otherwise we can run r as an oracle to

372
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
break the hardness assumption

373
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,680
the challenge of this kind of optimal

374
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
analysis is how to construct this

375
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,720
special hypothetical adversary and how

376
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
to simulate this kind of project with

377
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
azure probability

378
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,560
that's a designated value

379
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
we consider a

380
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,880
hypothetical project uh attacking as

381
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,839
follows

382
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
a set of message m zeros

383
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
are chosen some subset of random

384
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,079
messages

385
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,360
will be also shown certify uh mi has

386
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,839
this number of message

387
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,720
this

388
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,600
message size setting is to let the error

389
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
probability the same no matter how r

390
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,279
program the reduction okay

391
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
the the hypothetic adversary we have

392
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,560
first make our type zero q is a message

393
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
in m zero

394
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160
the attribution will later make or type

395
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,720
one series of message in m1 but before

396
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,399
this the attribute will make simple q is

397
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
or message in

398
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,240
uh n0 excluding m1

399
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
the last uh type

400
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,079
curious is this and actually it contains

401
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,839
a signature of message m star

402
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
because there's no signature queries on

403
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,039
uh

404
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
or message m-style so the other way can

405
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,640
return this as the first change

406
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,679
to simulate such a hypothetic adversary

407
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
the main difficulty is how to simulate

408
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,320
or type iqs in red color because this

409
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
has security contains some block

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,720
signatures and they are hard to be

411
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
computed without having a cpt

412
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
and this problem is solved with

413
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
rewinding and it requires at most n

414
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
types of binding

415
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,559
taking a uh t1 m1 as an example

416
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,160
after the

417
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
the state uh which is

418
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,200
we receive the response to security type

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,360
zeroed then before the rewind

420
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
uh we uh we'll make signature query on

421
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
our message in m1

422
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
and then we rewind

423
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,440
to rewind

424
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
to the state after

425
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,559
uh type geo queries then we will make

426
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,440
our

427
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,240
signature queries on our message

428
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,039
in m0 disclosing m1

429
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
if that's not about by r

430
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
then we

431
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,200
will be able to use

432
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,280
uh the signatures uh mythology wind

433
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
to simulate the type

434
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,240
one actually in n1

435
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
okay

436
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
the last is to calculate the error

437
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,799
probability

438
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
the error occurs

439
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
when there is

440
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
an integer i dash

441
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,720
such that before the rewind

442
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,160
r cannot respond to the curious means

443
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,400
that the simulated atmosphere doesn't

444
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
know

445
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
uh have the signatures okay

446
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
and after rewind the the r can respond

447
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
to this curious it means that the

448
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,600
simulated adversity has to continue

449
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,559
to

450
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,880
make the following type

451
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,799
i dash

452
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
type i dash

453
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,400
queries or message in mi-dash

454
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,440
okay

455
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
and

456
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
the error probability is equal to these

457
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,160
two events

458
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
when

459
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,120
i dash is equal to one

460
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
we calculate the error probability based

461
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
on the setting about how many changes

462
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
are reducible in m0 okay

463
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
and no matter what n is there is no

464
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,520
arrow or the arrow is less than one over

465
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
q to power one of n

466
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,320
and based on this information and the

467
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,039
result we can calculate that the final

468
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,360
error probability is equal to

469
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,679
is this which is the

470
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,280
optimal loss

471
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,240
and this is the high level idea of our

472
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,120
analysis

473
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
conclusion okay

474
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
how to program a kind of reduction when

475
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
switches are unique

476
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
it's not trivial under

477
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
any non-interactive hacking assumption

478
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,240
in standard screen mode against general

479
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,360
adversary currently the only known title

480
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,039
reduction for

481
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,799
chain based contraction has reduction

482
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
laws n times

483
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
this q h to power 1 over n

484
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
and we prove that the optimal loss is

485
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,280
actually q to power 1 over n and we show

486
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,880
how to obtain such an optimal

487
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
optimal reduction with a completely

488
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
different approach

489
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
we would like to thank

490
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
people yaga for insightful discussion on

491
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
the first version of this work in 2020

492

thank you very much so is there any

498
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,280
questions we'll try to

499
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,440
ask them remotely and let's hope

500
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
everything will work

501
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
from taking our sites are there any

502
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,559
questions

503
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,120
no questions

504
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,200
well if not then let's thank the speaker

505
