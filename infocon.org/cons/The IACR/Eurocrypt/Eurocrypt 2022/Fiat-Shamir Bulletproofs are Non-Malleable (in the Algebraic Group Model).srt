1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,799
thank you thank you

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,120
um

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
right so i will be talking about

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,040
future made bulletproofs being

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,040
non-malleable in the agm model

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
in this work we give a modular security

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,720
analysis to show how to prove simulation

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
extractability for

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,160
multi-round protocols

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
and in particular we show an application

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
towards one specific proof system

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
uh top being bullet proofs

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
so to

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,840
start with

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
what is zero knowledge proofs it

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,760
consists of two two parties prover and a

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,040
verifier and the prover uh owns a secret

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
input witness w

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
and he claims that uh public statement x

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,360
common w is in some relation r

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
and then the prover and the verifier go

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,440
through this interactive protocol where

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,719
the prover sends

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
messages and the verifier tosses coins

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
and sends back challenges

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
and then in the end we want the

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,920
following properties

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
we want it to be complete which means

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
that if the approver is honest so he

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,320
knows the witness

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,560
in that case with very high probability

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
he should be able to convince the

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,640
verifier

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
uh we should have the protocol should be

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
proof of knowledge which means that

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
there exists an extractor that can

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
extract the witness

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
and in the real world it means that if

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,400
the approver manages to convince a

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,799
verifier uh the prover must know the

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,560
witness

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
and finally we want it to be zero

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
knowledge which means that there exists

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
a simulator that can simulate a

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
verifier's view again in the real world

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,360
this means that the verifier could have

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
generated the transcript by herself

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
and certainly her interaction with the

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,040
prover she's not really learning

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
anything extra

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,680
uh right

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
but in the real world we like to make

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
the interactive protocol non-interactive

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,640
because it reduces communication uh well

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,479
the number of interaction with the

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,200
verifier and the way we do it one way to

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
do this is using fiat trimming transform

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
so if you noticed all that the wi-fi was

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,160
doing in the previous slide in like any

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
public coin protocol is that it

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
tosses coins and sends it back to the

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,160
approver there's no internal secret

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,920
so we can replace that with a random

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,239
oracle and the prover instead thinks the

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
random oracle for the challenges by

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
asking for hashes of the statement and

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
the transcript so far and then towards

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
the end send the entire transcript to

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
the verifier

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
one additional advantage that the

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,280
approver has in the interactive case

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,519
compared to the normal sorry the more

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,800
interactive case compared to the

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
interactive case

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,879
is that the prover gets to pink the

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
random oracle for multiple challenges

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
and then pick the one that it likes to

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
complete the proof

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,920
okay

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
so the standard security definition that

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,440
is

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,120
considered is proof of knowledge or

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
since we are in the non-attractive world

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
fiat chamber extract extractability

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
so we see we want an extractor who has

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
access to the prover and initiates an

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,720
interaction with the prover

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,560
and the extractor is also sometimes

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
responsible for

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
simulating the random numerical queries

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
that the approval might make in the real

92
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,440
world

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
and then it takes the final forgery

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
which is the statement and the proof pi

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
star and it outputs a witness

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
such that if the final proof verifies

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,319
then the witness is a valid one

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,120
but is as it turns out this notion of

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
security might not be enough in practice

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
one example can be so charlie is an

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
honest approver and he has some amount

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
of money in his bank and he makes a

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840
public statement claiming that he has at

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
least hundred dollars and he has a

105
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
public proof file

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,760
and then lucy is a current prover

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
and if pie is

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
malleable she can take by mull it

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
locally generate a different proof price

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
star and claim that she also has a

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,840
certain amount of money when she really

112
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,120
doesn't and then a third party has

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
absolutely no reason

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
not to trust lucy

115
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
so what is happening here

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
that is not captured by plane extraction

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
is that lucy who's corrupt gets to see

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,040
a bunch of honest proofs before she gets

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
to uh

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
make her forgery

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,919
so that is captured by something

122
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,280
stronger which is simulation

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
extractability so in addition to the

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
random oracle there are there is also

125
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,840
proof oracle or a simulator

126
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,199
that the

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
approver gets to play

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,639
a bunch of times

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,120
and then the prover gets to make

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
its forgery and even in the stronger

131
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
case we want that the extractor should

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,240
extract valid witness in case the final

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
proof verifies and if it's if it had not

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
if it wasn't queried earlier

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
uh to the simulator

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
okay so in this work we consider uh we

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,639
re-study simulation extractability for

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,000
bullet proofs

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
and a little bit about

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,800
why bulletproofs well it's a very

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
attractive proof system it has lots of

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
good properties that we like it's

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
uh public coin it does transparent setup

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
that can be removed in the random oracle

145
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
model

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
uh it's it is extremely efficient

147
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,600
communication wise and it's deployed in

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,199
the real world

149
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
so we care about whether or not it's

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
secure

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,320
um right but there's one challenge while

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,639
considering simulation extractability

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,280
here uh bulletproofs has non-constant

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
number of rounds

155
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
and at the time of writing this paper

156
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,840
uh one well the only way we knew how to

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
prove simulation extractability how to

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
approach it was

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,120
uh to go from the interactive version to

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
the non-interactive

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
via naive production and that would

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,479
result in an exponential blow up

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
in terms of the number of rounds

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
so of course that's not that's not good

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,720
when it comes to bullet troops or any

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,440
non-constant round protocol

167
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
but recently there was this work by

168
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,400
gershol and tessarro in crypto last year

169
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
where they circumvent this blow up by

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
considering a stronger

171
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
uh

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,840
stronger definition of online extraction

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
and they do this by proving it in the

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
agm model

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
but note that this work only addresses

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,759
extraction

177
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
it doesn't satisfy the stronger property

178
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,720
of simulation extra extractability

179
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
but this is already a good starting

180
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
point

181
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,520
um

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,039
all right

183
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,080
so what is online extraction

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
it's a stronger variant of the plane

185
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,560
extraction that we saw and one

186
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,919
one

187
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,240
caveat or one constraint

188
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
that we have here is that the extractor

189
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
cannot does not have this additional

190
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,880
power of rewinding the adversary while

191
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,840
it's trying to extract the witness

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,080
uh

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
to to prove this stronger property like

194
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
like gushal and tesaro we also consider

195
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,080
agm

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
and which means that all the algorithms

197
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,199
are algebraic

198
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,280
and they can only do group operations

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,919
and moreover if an algorithm outputs a

200
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,240
group element it must also output the

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
way this group element was generated so

202
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
if it outputs y it must also output even

203
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
to en

204
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,400
um

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,240
right

206
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
the way it's formally defined is to

207
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
consider a real and ideal world in the

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,160
real world of course we have the random

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,919
oracle the prover query is a random

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,400
oracle and then outputs the proof

211
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
in the ideal world we have the extractor

212
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
the extractor is internally split into

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,479
two parts easier and even

214
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
the first part is responsible for

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,639
answering the proof

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,319
the random oracle queries in a

217
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,160
consistent way

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,479
and the second part takes this this

219
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
final output and outputs the witness the

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,919
crucial thing to note here is that evil

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,120
does not have any power whatsoever

222
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
uh any additional power over um the

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
adversary approver

224
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
and all it does is it just takes this

225
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
final output and outputs the witness

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,200
and the conditions remains the same as

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,080
before

228
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
but in addition we also want that the

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
real real world and the ideal worldview

230
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
for the prover are indistinguishable

231
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,320
to extend this to simulation extraction

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
extractability

233
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
in the real world we also have the

234
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,959
simulator

235
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,480
and then the prover outputs the proof

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,920
and in the ideal world we have this

237
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,080
additional part to the

238
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
extractor which is responsible for

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
taking care of these simulation or the

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,440
proof oracle queries

241
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
and the conditions well they remain

242
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
almost the same as the previous

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
case

244
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
so

245
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,480
this

246
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
like study simulation extractivity has

247
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,359
been done before

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
i do not remember the names i'm sorry

249
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
but it has been done before and the

250
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,600
crucial central idea there uh that is

251
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
that is exploited is

252
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
where a lot of the similarities does not

253
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
give any additional power

254
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
to the adversary

255
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
in that case

256
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,800
it's enough to rely on the extract

257
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,720
extractability

258
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,440
definition extractability property of

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
the underlying protocol

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
and in fact if the protocol has unique

261
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,279
responses we can say something

262
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
something of this form

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,600
so what is unique response

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,040
uh consider two transcripts that have

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
the same

266
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,800
prefix so i'm going to

267
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
i

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,519
are the same and then the it splits at

269
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
the eye prover message so mi and mi

270
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,440
prime are different

271
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,800
and we say that

272
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,959
for protocol pi

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,279
uh it is very hard for the adversary to

274
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,519
come up with such two transcripts that

275
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
have the same prefix and then they split

276
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
at a certain point

277
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
and in particular this if a protocol has

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
something like this it would imply that

279
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
the adversary cannot reuse a simulated

280
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
transcript

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
um

282
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,399
so

283
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,800
the theorem that is the

284
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
variant of the theorem that is shown by

285
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
these prior works

286
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
goes a bit like this

287
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
if the interactive protocol has

288
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,079
extraction honest verifies your

289
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
knowledge and unique response then the

290
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,200
non-interactive protocol has simulation

291
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
extractability

292
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
and the proof would

293
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
well for the proof you would construct

294
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
an extractor for simulation

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
extractability

296
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
and that extractor would answer the

297
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
proof queries by running the hvck

298
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
simulator internally

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
and

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,519
if that extractor would take the final

301
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,360
forgery made by the approver it would

302
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
check if this forgery

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
has a mulching prefix with one of the

304
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,839
simulated transcript if it does reduce

305
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
it to the unique response property

306
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,839
otherwise just use the extractor that we

307
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
have from ext

308
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
so we can use this well the question is

309
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
can we use this for bulletproofs because

310
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
we already have something similar in the

311
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,959
prior works

312
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
we have also verified zero knowledge for

313
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,279
bulletproofs but do we have

314
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
extraction and do we have unique

315
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
response

316
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,480
and

317
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,839
well we need something stronger for

318
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,920
extraction we need online extractability

319
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
and one of the reasons we need this is

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
because we rely on a prior road by

321
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,200
uh gershol

322
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,160
so yeah the first question is answered

323
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,079
uh bulletproof does have um

324
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
the non-attractive version of

325
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
bulletproof is online extractable in the

326
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,360
agm but does it have unique responses

327
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
uh to see that this is a very rough

328
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
sketch of bullet proofs in the first

329
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
round we prove our comments to the

330
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,680
witness in the second round the verify

331
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,079
sunspot challenges and then approver

332
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,760
computes some polynomials based on the

333
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
first two rounds

334
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,800
and commits to it using randomness r

335
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
so of course the prover could like use

336
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
the same first to run messages use

337
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
different randomness to commit to the

338
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
same polynomials

339
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
and come up with these two transcripts

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
that have the same prefix that is the

341
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
first two round messages and a different

342
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,399
third round message

343
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,959
and more generally any protocol that has

344
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
an intermediate randomized round will

345
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,880
not have unique response

346
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
but

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
let's take a step back all we needed for

348
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
the proof to go through

349
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
was that the adversary should not be

350
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
able to reuse a simulated transcript

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,480
so in fact the the observation is that

352
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
the the definitions that we have in the

353
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
literature

354
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
are way too strong and it suffices to

355
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
fix one of the transcript

356
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
it suffices to fix an honest transcript

357
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
pi and then ask the adversary to come up

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,000
with a pi prime with respect to this pi

359
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,399
uh and in this work we

360
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,560
well we introduced this notion and it's

361
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,079
inspired from state restoration

362
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,000
soundness which was introduced by

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,160
pensacon at all

364
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
and uh so state restoration soundness

365
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,680
captures this uh this additional

366
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
advantage that the approver has in the

367
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,000
non-attractive case very nicely

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the additional advantage being that the

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
prover can in some sense rewind the

370
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,480
verifier a bunch of times and ask for

371
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
different challenges and then pick the

372
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
charges that it likes

373
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
so so so the way we define unique

374
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,040
response

375
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
is well first of all the approval must

376
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
have the proof that

377
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
with respect to which it has to create

378
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
this fork so first approver is provided

379
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,079
with a proof from the simulator

380
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,519
with respect to the statement of its

381
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,040
choice

382
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,399
then it gets access to a state

383
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,639
restoration oracle

384
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,519
that behaves in some sense as a verifier

385
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
in the real world

386
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,480
uh so the prover can send messages to

387
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,639
the oracle and in response get back

388
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
challenges just as it as it would in the

389
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,399
real world

390
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
and the oracle would maintain everything

391
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
that it sees from the approver

392
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
and now the prover can

393
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,719
send this

394
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
rewind message to the to the oracle

395
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
so that it can send a different

396
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
uh into prime together to receive a

397
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
different c2 prime

398
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,519
and the oracle also maintains this fort

399
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
that was made from n2 to m2 prime and to

400
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,079
star

401
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
and in the end the prover submits a pi

402
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
prime which would correspond to some

403
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,880
part in the execution tree that is

404
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
maintained by the state restoration

405
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,959
oracle and the winning condition is

406
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
well the pi prime should be accepting

407
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
and it should

408
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
have a prefix

409
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,079
matching prefix with pi but it should

410
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
differ at some point

411
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,600
and intuitively this should be hard for

412
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
the prover to do

413
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,199
because if the proverb doesn't know the

414
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
witness

415
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
because the challenges are picked at

416
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
random

417
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
and so

418
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,759
okay so so this this definition is

419
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
an interactive version of the definition

420
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,120
but towards the end we want to argue

421
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
something about non-interactive protocol

422
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
and in the paper we show that if the

423
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,839
interactive

424
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
proof system satisfies this weaker

425
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,320
version of unique response

426
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
the non-interactive version wi-fi

427
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,639
attribute also satisfies weak unique

428
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
response

429
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,360
okay so we have this from prior works

430
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
if we have these three properties in

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
some ways we can show simulation

432
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,959
extraction

433
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,759
but we begin with interactive properties

434
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
and then we go towards non-interactive

435
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,519
uh the first part

436
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,720
that is

437
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,279
well extraction is already shown by

438
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,000
kushal and tesoro and i wouldn't i am

439
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
not going to talk about

440
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,320
uh srsv which is state restoration

441
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
witnessed extended emotion which is a

442
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,079
property that they consider in their

443
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,759
paper

444
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,199
and we know this

445
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,519
we've known this for quite some time

446
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,079
uh so so if we can show for the

447
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
interactive bulletproof protocol if we

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
can show that it has unique response

449
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
then because of the reduction

450
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
which i will talk about that we have in

451
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
the paper we have this

452
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,079
and then given these three things

453
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,880
we finally arrive uh well we can say

454
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
that bullet proofs are simulation

455
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,399
extraction

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,120
so all that remains now is to

457
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
see that

458
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
bulletproofs has unique response and

459
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,880
then we're done

460
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
so at a high level we have a simulated

461
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,799
transcript

462
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
and the adversary submits pi prime

463
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
with respect to pi

464
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,400
since we are in the agm model uh agm

465
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,520
world we assume that the uh simulator is

466
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
algebraic and in fact it is for

467
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,079
bulletproofs so we assume that the

468
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,160
simulator

469
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
along with pi it also submits the way it

470
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
was generated so it outputs a 1 b 1 a i

471
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,760
b i and so on so forth and then the

472
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
adversary is algebraic and so it also

473
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,799
submits

474
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
its representation so x i y i

475
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
and

476
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
uh etc

477
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,320
and

478
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
you might guess it but

479
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
we would use schwarzpalema

480
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
only given these two uh transcripts in

481
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
their group representation to break

482
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,840
discrete log at some

483
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,559
point a little bit more in detail so for

484
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
bullet proofs

485
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
either

486
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,160
we can break discrete log directly by

487
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,360
analyzing

488
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
uh the verification checks so the first

489
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
one we have because pi verifies which is

490
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
the simulated transcript and the second

491
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
one is because the adversary transcript

492
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
verifies

493
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,679
and r here is some a value that only

494
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,240
depends on the

495
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,919
shared prefix

496
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,000
or in a slightly complicated

497
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,039
uh

498
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,400
analysis

499
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
we would

500
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,360
we can say because because the

501
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
adversarial transcript verifies and

502
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
because of the verification check we can

503
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,799
say something

504
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,400
of the form that the first equation

505
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
should be zero uh and since ci's are

506
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,559
picked by the state restoration oracle

507
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,320
and they're random therefore this

508
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
polynomial must be a zero polynomial and

509
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
therefore a i sorry a one must be a zero

510
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
and a one is something that the

511
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
simulator picked at random so well it

512
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,679
will not be zero with very high

513
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
probability

514
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
um

515
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,960
so once again

516
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
we proved that fiat

517
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,000
simulation extractable in the agm

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
random oracle model and we show this

519
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
relation between the advantage of

520
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,440
different adversaries we consider

521
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
um

522
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
right

523
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
and

524
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,679
well q2 is the number of simulation

525
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,320
queries that the adversary

526
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,639
makes

527
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,039
to conclude

528
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,360
um we have a new approach to show

529
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
non-interactive protocols our simulation

530
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
extractable

531
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
we give a concrete analysis for bullet

532
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,799
proofs and range proof

533
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,960
and this might be applicable for other

534
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,760
multi-run constructions

535
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
and

536
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
well one final thing

537
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
there was a concurrent work by atema

538
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,480
atoll where they proved that

539
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
the non-interactive protocols

540
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
the non-interactive multi-round

541
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,159
protocols have

542
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,880
are extractable and they do this without

543
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
assuming your gm

544
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,799
and using their result we can remove the

545
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
reliance on agm from our own result and

546
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,600
this is something which is still work in

547
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
progress and will be soon up on the

548
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
print

549
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,200
thank you

550
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,120
thank you mark do we have any questions

551
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
please walk to the microphone if you can

552
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
thanks

553
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
thanks for your great presentation i

554
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,039
mean

555
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,120
uh so now that you don't do the

556
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,919
extraction by rewinding uh can we also

557
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,679
think about black box variant after

558
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,240
stimulation extractivity

559
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
i mean let's say we have extractor which

560
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
is universal it doesn't depend on the

561
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,240
adversary because you don't need to

562
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,919
rewind the adversary yeah if i could

563
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,960
correct

564
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
yes

565
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
so because this version that you said

566
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,360
i'm still not sure if it's uh black box

567
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,080
extractable maybe crafters can comment

568
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
anything um so

569
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
so you mean there's an extractor that

570
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
works for all adversaries yeah because

571
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,039
there is a result that if you have black

572
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,720
box extractability of this simulation

573
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
exactly so that should be

574
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,159
enough to realize the ideal

575
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
functionality of this nist in uc model

576
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
so now i'm just curious to know that if

577
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
this is sufficient because now you don't

578
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,400
use rewinding of this

579
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
well i think there's

580
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
so

581
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,480
so do you mean like simulation

582
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
extractability proving simulation

583
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
extractability in the uc if if you can

584
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,559
if this is black box then

585
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,240
would this imply simulation

586
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,320
extractability in the uc yeah my

587
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
question might let's clarify so my

588
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,720
question is that does this simulation

589
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,880
exactly that that you achieve

590
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,799
is for black box simulation extractivity

591
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
or i saw that it's not non-black box

592
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
because you don't use rewinding of

593
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
adversary

594
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,000
i'm not sure actually

595
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
uh one comment on that maybe there's

596
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,919
also an algebraic remodel in the middle

597
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,360
so maybe that's also tricky

598
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
right that's also true yeah

599
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
without jam no but then you would rewind

600
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,960
so we remove adrian by rewinding the

601
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
adversary a bunch of times

602
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,900
let's thank the speaker again

603
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:42,809
[Applause]
