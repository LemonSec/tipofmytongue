1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,040
we are in another mpc uh

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,160
session

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,759
the first stock is universally

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,840
composable subversion of resilient

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,440
cryptography

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,400
and another will give a talk

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
hello

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
hi everyone uh i'm bernardo

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
so i'll give i'll talk about universally

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,400
composable subversion resilient

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
cryptography so this is a joint work

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
with sugar sugradip chakraborty jasper

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
bull nielsen and uh danielle venturi

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,559
okay so first like a little background

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,160
on subversion

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,079
so this is about the setting where there

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,760
is like this very powerful adversary

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,200
that is able to

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
like uh tamper with the the

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,280
implementation uh of the honest parties

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
the protocol can like replace the party

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
or or change the specification

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and do all that so i mean this actually

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
started like back in the 80s and 90s

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
but it's really like picked up more

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,440
steam after like edwards know this

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
revelation about uh

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
like all these intelligence agencies

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
like putting this type of attack forward

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,479
and other players

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,159
so this is actually like took off like

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,240
almost 10 years ago

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
and the current uh

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,799
state of affairs in the in this area is

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,040
that i mean we have different like many

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
different models

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,680
but all of them i mean they have the the

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
problem that they only uh imply like

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
stand-alone security so if you want to

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
build like a larger protocol like

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
composed of of smaller parties

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
like the current models don't allow you

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,439
to to show security like in this case of

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,320
of composition right

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,079
so what we do here

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,600
is we

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
extend the the universal composition

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
framework of cannabi

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,240
to accommodate for uh

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
for subversion

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
so in particular we we look into reverse

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
firewalls

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,159
which uh was was proposed in euro clip

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,200
15

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
which is about uh like uh like a piece

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,560
of hardware code that just sits between

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,758
like a party and the external world that

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,560
just sanitizes the communication to to

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
and from this party

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
so then to showcase i mean our model

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
we just built like uh commitment

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,120
sanitizable commitments coin toss and

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,680
then we build the malicious mpc like by

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
sanitizing gmw compiler

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
so before i mean we start like talking

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
about the model like a very very quick

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,120
like uc recap

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
so it's just to make sure i mean we're

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,879
all on the same page so in there you see

71
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
you usually define what is called an

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
ideal functionality for a task

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,879
and this is secured by definition right

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,239
so for example if you have like a

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,599
commitment

76
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,000
functionality i mean this just

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
has like a trusted third party that will

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
just take the messages and then sends

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
the opening tool to the other parties

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,599
when this is over

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
so the goal is to implement to to build

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,959
a protocol that implements this

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,560
functionality

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
so what this this means in uc

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
terminology

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
is that you need to build uh

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,159
a protocol that such that you build like

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,319
the simulator s

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,519
that

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,760
will communicate with this environment

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,879
right

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,480
such that i mean the view of the

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,800
environment in these two worlds needs to

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
be indistinguishable so the environment

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
cannot know if it's like running the

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
real protocol the adversary and the

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
parties

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
or if it's talking to the simulator like

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
in an ideal world with this

100
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,080
functionality that is secure by by

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,159
definition

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
so now in our model too to accommodate

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
for these reverse firewalls

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,120
we split like every like party in the

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
protocol into two parties now so we have

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,319
a core and a firewall so the core is

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,040
responsible to to computing every

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
message of the protocol like all the

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
crypto everything happens in the core

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
and the firewall just

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
sits there like sanitizing every message

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,319
that the the core sends or receives

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
so

114
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,200
in uh

115
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,959
in the you see like these two parties

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,159
now that we split the core in the

117
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
firewall they are like independent

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
parties okay so in particular they can

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,759
be like independently corrupted and they

120
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
cannot communicate with each other

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
directly right only through the ideal

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
functionalities

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
so and following like previous work

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
the type of corruption that that we

125
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
allow is what we call like uh like a

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
species corruption

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,639
which is something that looks uh like

128
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
good on the surface but uh

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,199
i mean it's still doing something bad

130
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,680
it's like leaking information like

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
via some subliminal channel

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,560
or has like some secret trigger message

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
that is shared with adversity that

134
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,720
allows it to extract some message

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
because it's not hard to see that but

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
some functionality is like arbitrary

137
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
type of of corruption we cannot uh

138
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
provide security for because like a fire

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,440
simply cannot sanitize in some cases

140
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
so we need to to restrict to this type

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
of species corruptions

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
so one like important notion uh in our

143
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
model is that of sanitizable ideal

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
functionality

145
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,400
so this is an ideal functionality that

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,639
will have like a like a dedicated

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
sanitation interface that we call which

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,840
is to communicate only to with the

149
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,400
firewalls so the the cores use this io

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,960
this input output interface on the top

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
and only the firewall that uses the

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
sanitation interface

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
an implant like a protocol implementing

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
something like this would look like

155
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
like each party is a core in a firewall

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,199
right

157
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,639
and they talk to

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,960
here is is shown in this g hybrid model

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
which is the protocol using some other

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,919
functionality

161
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,160
and note that like the the car and the

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
firewall they both implement the the

163
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,120
i mean the interface of f right the

164
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
firewall here implements the sanitation

165
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
interface because later on there will be

166
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
like some some other firewall that will

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
connect to this right

168
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,039
i mean another thing that that we

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,280
obviously can do is just sanitize like a

170
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,560
normal uh uc functionality that we have

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,880
for example this functionality f

172
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,000
think of like as a coin toss for example

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
and then we want like a sanitized coin

174
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,199
toss

175
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,520
and then the protocol that implements it

176
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
would look something like this i mean

177
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
the protocol would have a firewall

178
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
even though the functionality does not

179
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
right but like for the protocol to

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
sanitize it will have the the the viral

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
and the the core

182
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
and this dotted line here proposed more

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,680
or less like the the the usual flow of

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
communication inside the

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
sanitizable functionality you can see

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,919
like the the c1 i mean when it sends the

187
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
message the functionality usually gets

188
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
rerouted to the firewall they can do

189
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
some processing

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
just to later on get gets forward to the

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
other party that goes first through the

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
firewall of the other party and then out

193
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
so to to to have a protocol to to show

194
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
that realizes this functionality we need

195
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
like some wrapper around this

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
functionality right because it's like a

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,199
normal functionality it doesn't have the

198
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,880
sanitation interface

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,479
so we need something to take care of all

200
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,880
this boilerplate code that just so you

201
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
can show that uh

202
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
i mean that the environment cannot

203
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
trivially distinguish like the two cases

204
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
because just like the number of parties

205
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
and so on

206
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,560
so another

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
like important uh

208
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
notion for like this regular uc

209
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,800
functionalities that you want to build a

210
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,840
firewall from is transparency so

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
so if you have like an honest uh core

212
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,720
and you put a firewall like uh in

213
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,479
between its communication you don't want

214
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
the spiral to change the communication

215
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,479
behavior of the core

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,639
so so it needs to be transparent to the

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,759
firewall

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,280
to the owners to the core if this

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,560
firewall is even there right

220
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
so i mean now that we have like this two

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
separate parties then we have like some

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
other types of uh

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,039
corruptions

224
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,240
i mean now we have like all these

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
different like corruption patterns right

226
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
that uh would have to build like a

227
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
simulator from so so that's why like the

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
crime phase because you have like too

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
many like corruption patterns now

230
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
but i mean so the idea is to map like

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
all these corruption patterns into some

232
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,639
behavior like for the party in the

233
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
functionality

234
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
so upon the closer inspection

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
i mean we don't need of course to take

236
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
care of all of these but just a few

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
because the others are just special

238
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
cases of some

239
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
so for example the malaysians here at

240
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
the bottom and then we look at the

241
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
species and honest

242
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,599
spiral this would give

243
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,039
something that is like

244
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
like a spacious corruption let's say

245
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
and then you have like honest viral

246
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
onus core and a malicious firewall this

247
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
will give

248
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
what we call like an isolated party in

249
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
the functionality

250
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
because this this could be that the

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
phyro is just simply like cutting the

252
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
communication of the

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,920
of the the party with the outside for

254
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
example

255
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
and then like honest and seminars like

256
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,279
the semi honest fighter here is just two

257
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,240
to

258
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
i mean to not allow for like trivial

259
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
solutions where like all the secrets are

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
transferred to the firewall and then it

261
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,640
can just compute the protocol itself

262
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
so okay let's get rid of all the other

263
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,839
ones

264
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
and let's focus on these four now so

265
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
specious and honest

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
this is the most interesting one right

267
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,440
is the one that we want to show that if

268
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
you have like a specious corruption in a

269
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
non-spiral

270
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
this should like it gives us like an

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
honest part in the functionality right i

272
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,279
mean that's the whole point of the

273
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,920
firewall so we have this this notion of

274
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
strong sanitation that we that we have

275
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,959
uh and what is very nice is that this

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,959
allows us to to like through

277
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
indistinguishability argument

278
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,399
like uh

279
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,000
like just show that an environment

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
cannot distinguish like a species score

281
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,279
like together with the honest spiral

282
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,839
from on its core and unknown spiral

283
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
so i mean you don't need to analyze this

284
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
case in this in the simulator that's

285
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
like the good news i mean you just prove

286
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,519
like like a separate lemma like on your

287
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,640
firewall

288
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
so now like we're back to these three

289
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,600
cases

290
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
now the isolated i mean could be think

291
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
of

292
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
like for some functionalities to have

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,079
like some security with a board type of

294
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
thing

295
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
but uh like for many cases i mean you

296
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,279
you could also map this like to

297
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
malicious if you don't care about the

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
like this flavor of security for example

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
like in coin toss i mean we just need to

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
map to malicious

301
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
and then we're back like to this just

302
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,720
two cases right

303
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
that we need to consider in the

304
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,519
simulator so that's good news i mean we

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,120
only need to look at

306
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,519
honest core seminars fire off and

307
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
maliciously malicious

308
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
and like you prove the strong sanitation

309
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,120
on the side

310
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
so how how do we do uh

311
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
uh like commitment for example for

312
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
example right in this model so the first

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
thing

314
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
we need to define what is the

315
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
sanitizable commitment functionality

316
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
so you take like the normal commitment

317
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
functionality

318
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
where parties send like message uh they

319
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,279
commit

320
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,600
and then uh later on the functionality

321
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,079
opens to the receiver and we added the

322
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,760
sanitation interface so this interface

323
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
every time like a party like uh tries to

324
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
commit to something the firewall like

325
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,000
the sorry the functionality signals the

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
firewall and the firewall gets the

327
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,040
chance to

328
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,519
to blind like this message for example

329
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
just to sanitize it

330
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,279
and then like uh

331
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,680
when it opens it gets like the sanitized

332
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
uh input

333
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
so we built this like an iuc commitment

334
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
like uh

335
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,200
was inspired of the karnataki sarcar one

336
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
of asia clip 20 i think

337
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,160
this is based on ddh i'm not going like

338
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
into the details of the of the protocol

339
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
here

340
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
this is on the paper but the main idea

341
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
is that i mean the construction allows

342
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
like for the firewall to like

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
re-randomize everything and then like on

344
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,000
the opening like readjust to to what it

345
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,360
did

346
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,079
and the the kind of theorem that that

347
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,600
would prove i mean that we call like

348
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
this

349
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
sruc which is like for subverse

350
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
subversion resistant resilient you see

351
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,920
which just means i mean the only

352
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,519
difference is that i mean

353
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
the the environment and the adversary

354
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,320
they are quantified over this uh species

355
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,160
environment and adversity which are the

356
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
ones that can do this type of species

357
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,519
corruption

358
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
like uh

359
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
in the in the idea model

360
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,720
so

361
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
now i mean that we have this sanitizable

362
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
commitment

363
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
so we want to build a coin toss

364
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,839
so now i mean we do it in this uh f hat

365
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,000
uh like uh sanitized con

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
uh hybrid model

367
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,480
so uh so now i mean th this

368
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
i mean the cool part is that numbing

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
does now this is pretty simple because

370
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
you already have the sanitizable

371
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
commitment

372
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
so you basically just do like the coin

373
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
toss as you would i mean you like each

374
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
card just samples like some some value

375
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
si

376
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
tries to commit to the functionality

377
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
now the firewall that uh that you're

378
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,920
implementing will sample like some

379
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,079
randomness and send to the firewall to

380
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,560
send to the to the functionality to

381
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,519
blind the the this input

382
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,480
and now the output is like this s where

383
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,120
it's like just like recombining all the

384
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,760
all the openings of the other parties

385
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
combined with the stuff of the core and

386
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,839
the firework right just si and ri

387
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,200
and then i mean you can show that this

388
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
is now we call it this wsr because like

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,079
this wrapped subversion within it

390
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,200
because this is like a normal

391
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
functionality right so we need like this

392
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
wrapper around it to be able to show

393
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
and this is also quantified over like a

394
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
species

395
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,199
environment and adversity

396
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,480
so yeah i mean this is like an

397
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
illustration of how this would look like

398
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
actually so the the orange one is the

399
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
coin toss protocol

400
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
which is using the the green one which

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,000
is the commitment protocol you

402
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,880
implemented and this f set here is just

403
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,680
like uh like a sanitized message

404
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,240
transmission uh functionality i mean

405
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
where like all our protocols are built

406
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
on top but

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,519
yeah we don't need to worry about that

408
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,399
now

409
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,880
so this is just to see like how the the

410
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
firewalls and the cars will connect and

411
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
here you can see like the orange

412
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,399
since this is just a normal ec

413
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,680
functionality you don't need to

414
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
implement like a sanitation interface

415
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,000
right but the green one does because

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,360
like when you build the fire for the

417
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,160
coin toss the the firework will

418
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
communicate with the with the

419
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,399
the firo of the commitment protocol

420
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,440
uh so now i mean how we build uh

421
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,079
malicious mpc like with uh all this

422
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,760
right like just uh combining the pieces

423
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,720
so we we so we sanitize the gmw which is

424
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,519
a

425
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,639
gold rike

426
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,240
mikali we just only 87. so this is

427
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
like how to turn seminars and pc into a

428
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
maliciously secure npc

429
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
the main idea is

430
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
like all those parties they run like

431
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,120
this augmented coin toss i mean to get

432
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,279
like a like a random string

433
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
where the the each party will use this

434
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,839
as the random tape the others will have

435
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,920
commitments to this

436
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,839
and then like the parties will commit to

437
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,839
their inputs

438
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
and every message that they produce in

439
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,959
the protocol they will prove in zero

440
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
knowledge that this message was computed

441
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,519
correctly like with respect to like

442
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
input transcript and random tape of the

443
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,160
party

444
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,800
so i mean one difficulty that we have

445
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,959
is that we cannot prove uh like things

446
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,320
about uh

447
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
you see commitments right

448
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,000
because i mean there's no notion of

449
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
having like a bit string or something

450
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,040
that you can prove like a statement

451
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,519
about so we cannot just use like the

452
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
commitment plus the

453
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,399
plus the coin toss and build it direct

454
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,160
so we need like this large like commit

455
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
improve functionality that we'll do

456
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,639
we'll do like a commit and prove like

457
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
inside of one functionality right

458
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,480
so we also build that but now we need

459
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,079
like a sanitizable commitment

460
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,519
so i mean the difference of the standard

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,759
commit improve is that now i mean the

462
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,600
firewall i mean again we'll have the

463
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,759
option like to sanitize the inputs that

464
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,920
are sent and sanitize like the the

465
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,399
statements that it's proving

466
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,480
so we i mean we build look at this uh

467
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,199
this commit improve in this sruc model

468
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,480
and i mean the construction is just

469
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,519
basically the construction of the

470
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,600
commitment that we have plus uh we

471
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
randomize bones

472
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
and then we can show that that we we can

473
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,880
have the sanitizable commit improve

474
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
now i mean let's put all together and

475
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,199
build this gmw

476
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,079
using the commit improve and the the

477
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
sanitized

478
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
coin toss functionality

479
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
so now i mean everything uh becomes

480
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
pretty simple right you have like the

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
renault type generation

482
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
it's like uh almost exactly as before

483
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,560
like all the parties will commit to a

484
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
value

485
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,959
like with this

486
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
f cmp functionality

487
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,959
they will get

488
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
like some random string and then they

489
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
build like this random tape like

490
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,880
for uh core i which is this r hat i

491
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
and the other parties will have like the

492
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,119
commitments to it

493
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,959
and now i mean they all commit like to

494
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,640
their inputs to to the semi-honest

495
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,679
protocol

496
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,919
with the functionality

497
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,919
but now i mean the difference is that

498
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
the fire of this uh the commit improve

499
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,840
will not blind will not change the

500
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,280
message now right because you don't want

501
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
to change the message that you're

502
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,799
running the protocol on

503
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
so now the firearm is just uh just

504
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
let the message go and now the protocol

505
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,440
execution

506
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
it's simple you just run uh

507
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,760
like the semi honest

508
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
like with the the committed inputs the

509
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,520
the transcript and the random tape of

510
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,000
each party i mean each party like it

511
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919
runs with their own and every new

512
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
message that you produce

513
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,480
like you you ask the functionality to to

514
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,160
to make this proof

515
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
that this this message was produced

516
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
correctly with respect like to all the

517
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,760
messages that committed this transcript

518
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,559
and the the random tape

519
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,799
right and i mean of course like the the

520
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
this is the statement that is

521
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,799
parameterized by this by this

522
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
commit improve functionality this is the

523
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,480
statement that like this message is

524
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
produced correctly and so on

525
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,039
so now the firewall can like sanitize

526
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,480
the statement just means that i mean

527
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
we'll check if this si star which is the

528
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,840
output of the

529
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,120
the ftos functionality if the the

530
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
transcript is correct until now and so

531
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,120
on and everything is good i mean just

532
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,440
append this message transcript and just

533
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
run everything all over again right

534
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,320
so then we got to like gmw like

535
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
sanitized

536
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,799
yeah so concluding

537
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
i mean we yeah we proposed this new

538
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,120
model right to to handle

539
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
subversions uh

540
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,600
under composability

541
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,799
uh so i mean what else to be in here to

542
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,039
that can be done here is like what what

543
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,919
other functionalities can we build uh

544
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,480
firewalls for right like ot zero

545
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
knowledge etc like can we get more

546
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
efficient to mpc or like with adaptive

547
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
corruptions or what what are the

548
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,600
possibilities

549
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,760
yeah and that that's all i have guys

550
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
thanks

551
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
questions

552
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
okay let's thank the speaker

553
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
hey

554
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,000
thank you

555
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
thank you

556
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,559
yes thank you for a good talk um

557
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,440
i was wondering how you uh decided to

558
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
keep track of corruptions in the model

559
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,120
you made

560
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
um i know that like the kind of

561
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
suggested way of doing this in the uc is

562
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,159
having this like corruption aggregation

563
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,280
iti that somehow floats around

564
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080
um do you use that or did you use a

565
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,960
different uh well i mean we have this uh

566
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
like a species environment right that

567
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
can just like give the the corruption

568
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,919
instructions or like malicious

569
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
corruption or like semi honest or

570
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
species for for each like uh individual

571
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
party depending on on the pattern like

572
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,799
on the table

573
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
that's uh are you sure it is in the

574
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
party somehow that that this corruption

575
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
has happened or yeah yeah like yeah this

576
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,679
is escaping track like by the uh

577
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
by the environment yeah yeah okay thank

578
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,960
you

579
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
sure

580
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,039
any other questions

581
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,960
so let's thank the speaker again

582
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,720
thank you

583
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,080
and we have an announcement
