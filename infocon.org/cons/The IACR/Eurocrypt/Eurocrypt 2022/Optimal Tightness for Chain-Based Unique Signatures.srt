00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,560
hello everyone uh my name is fujinpu and

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,879
i'm presenting from australia

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,720
the title of our paper is optimal

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,440
techniques for chain based unix changes

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000
this work is joined with with sushi we

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
are both from the university of

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,640
wollongong

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,600
in this work we focus on this question

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,920
how to program a data deduction for a

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,640
single scheme when signatures are unique

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,720
meaning without using random numbers in

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,680
signature generations

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,920
security production is a popular method

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
for security proof and security

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
reduction supports that yes an adversary

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,160
who can break a scheme

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,200
will

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
reduce breaking the skin to solving

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,559
heart problems

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,559
a security reduction is tight if an

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,879
adversary can break the skin with time

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,840
constitute and probability if strong and

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
we can solve the hard problem with a

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,680
very close time cost and probability

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
title deduction guarantees that breaking

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,720
the skin is as difficult as solving a

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,280
heart problem

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
digital signatures are fundamental

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
primitive in modern cryptography how to

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,479
construct a single scheme with a tighter

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,880
deduction received loss of attention in

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,320
the individual

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
our community has also invented many

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,960
intelligent methods for tighter security

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
truth

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,320
with the efforts from our community it's

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,840
no longer hard to obtain tata deductions

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
if it's in a weak security model or if

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,040
it's under an interactive hardness

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
assumption or adverse rate with

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
restrictions in computations by the agm

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,119
the research question is narrowed down

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,840
to

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
how to have a title reduction under like

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
interactive assumption in standard

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,799
security model against general

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
adversaries

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
nowadays it's also not hard

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
to

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,479
achieve title deductions with these

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,119
three factors as long as signatures are

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,639
randomized

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
in the standard screw model

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,120
we must simulate some signatures for the

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
adversary before we receive a fortune

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,200
charge

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
the high level idea of title reduction

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
using the randomized approach works as

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
it is

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
since there are at least two valid

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
signatures for each message we program

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,319
the simulation in the way left while

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,879
signatures is simulatable means can be

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,959
simulated and the other signatures are

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,360
reducible means can be reduced

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
to solving heart problems

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
then when the adversary curate the

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
signatures of message mi would return a

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
seminal signature for it

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
then there's not know about in signature

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
theory and the first signature is

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,160
reducible with high probability

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
a consequent question is

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
how to have a type of reduction with

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,879
these three factors but without using

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
the genomized approach

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
this question is interesting because

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
unique signatures are special signatures

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
where each message has only one very

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
signature such as the well-known brs

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
signature scheme proposed 30 years ago

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
learn gender mind's approach cannot be

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
applied to have type reduction for unix

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
changes because there's only one very

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
significant for each message

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
the consequent thinking is is it

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
possible or not to have a data deduction

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,120
for a unique change scheme

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
well it seems impossible if all

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
simulations have a common feature as

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,680
this

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
and at the rest we can choose some

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
message make a basic high securities

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
before signature qas and signature 4g

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,519
such that

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
the switch on each message is

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
simulatable or reducible and this kind

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,319
of deduct cannot be changed by the

99
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,680
simulator

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
it's impossible because the edible

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
should get attacked initially

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
the adversary will first pick a message

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
and make theories such that all

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
signatures

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
are either simulatable or reduced load

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,720
length the anniversary will pick q

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
random of learn for signature queries

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
and forge the signature of the last

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
message

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
denoted by m star

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,720
if there are two signatures are

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
reducible then definitely the simulation

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
will not be successful because q

114
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,199
signatures must be simulatable

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
and if there's only one signature

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
reducible

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,120
the probability is at most point over q

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
because of some kind of driven choice by

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,479
the adversity

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
there have been many excellent proofs

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
with meta reduction showing that unix

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,199
signatures or their generalizations

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
cannot have success probability more

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
than one over cube in the standard

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,400
display model

126
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
on the other hand it's also possible to

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
achieve header reduction

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
when with the other four co-authors show

129
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,080
how to do this in crypto 17.

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
the purple singer scheme is called chain

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
based construction

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
each unique signature is composed of n

133
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160
block changes locate sigma 1 to sigma n

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
the key point is the signing structure

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
by the blockchain

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
the proximity just capital sigma and

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
zero are treated as message and signed

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,479
to attend capital signal m1

139
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,199
and capital system and one are treated

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,000
as message and sign again to obtain the

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
sigma m2

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
in the skew reduction for this single

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
scheme an adversary can be a choice

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,240
message and make hash hashiky such that

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,560
signatures on each message

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
is still either simulatable or reduced

147
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,400
but

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
the simulator has already solved heart

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,880
problems from heart periods in general

150
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
so how can the simulator solve the hard

151
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
problems with a high security

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,319
in the secure proof

153
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
each signature query each signature

154
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,400
request and different hashiques caught

155
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
from type 0 type 1 type 2 to type n

156
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
minus 1

157
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
and before the signature queue on

158
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
message m

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
the attribute should

160
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,360
make type 0 query first then type 1 and

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
then type 2 sequentially

162
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
this is because of the chain structure

163
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,520
the attribution must compute

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
locate sigma i by itself

165
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,800
for

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
type i query

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,840
which is some kind of computation ha

168
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,479
without knowing the secret key

169
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,440
so given a cbs permissions the prover

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,080
can set the secret key equal to a and

171
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,039
program the response to type i minus one

172
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
curing with g2b

173
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,319
learned the type i curate from the

174
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
adversary will contain locate signal i

175
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,400
which is the solution to the cdh problem

176
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
the challenge of titan reduction is that

177
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
we don't know how many theories for each

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
message the adversary we are curious

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
before it's situated the number ki

180
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
for message mr is definitely decided by

181
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
the adversary

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
of course if the aws would like to forge

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,759
the signature of message m start

184
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,880
it must make or end curious

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
um and start

186
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
an important finding in crypto17 is that

187
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
let capital qi to be the number of all

188
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,720
type iq is generated by adversary

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
no matter how the adversary curates

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
there must be just a special integer i

191
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
star such that qi star

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
and q as the plus one

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
is very close it means that the rate is

194
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,800
as small as one over q h to power one

195
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
over n and q h is the number of passive

196
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
queries

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
with this important finding the prover

198
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,759
choose uh can choose one of type extra

199
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
queries and respond to it with c2b

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
and then the cdh solution will appear in

201
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,280
one of type i star plus one queries

202
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,000
with a very high probability which is

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
equal to this

204
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,759
currently uh

205
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
there's uh only one method for proving

206
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,479
patterns of unique singers

207
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,519
which

208
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,958
was appeared

209
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,679
in crypto17 and the reduction loss is

210
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,200
this which is loctite

211
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
and least

212
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,839
the contribution uh in this workout

213
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
we first show that the optional optimal

214
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
loss is q to power one of n and q is the

215
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
number of signal curves

216
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
and we show how to obtain such an

217
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,920
optimal reduction

218
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
we introduce the second contribution

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
first

220
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,080
our proof for trend-based

221
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
bioscheme works as this without changing

222
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,720
the scheme okay uh having a cvh

223
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
performance we set our secret key equal

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
to a

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
a key point is led with none uniformly

226
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
choose an integer c from the range

227
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,120
0 to minus 1 for each message

228
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
learn we plan

229
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
to

230
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
send the response to type i type c

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
curates as the change qa i go to c

232
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
and this the response has the g to b

233
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,720
and other queries are

234
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
normal curious without t2b in response

235
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,800
okay then suppose the adversary makes a

236
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
type 0 type 1 to type k of m before

237
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
signature queries we have these kinds of

238
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,160
results

239
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,360
if k

240
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
is less than c it means that the

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,120
attribution has not yet cured the type c

242
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
q a message m

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
and

244
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,040
no we can change uh or we just set or

245
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
curate to normal q rates it means then

246
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,079
we can simulate the signatures okay some

247
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
kind of change here

248
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
and if k is c we have to abort because

249
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
we cannot simulate the signature but if

250
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
k is larger than c then the hard

251
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,240
parameter

252
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
has already appeared in type c plus one

253
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
period

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
we consider the simple case

255
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
that the answer version will make one

256
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
synthetic before the singular fortune

257
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
okay now something big has appeared here

258
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,959
the success probability is equal to next

259
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,680
the probability of solving

260
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
problems

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,399
before signature theories plus something

262
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
happened from the first signature well

263
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
there's no success or not about

264
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
uh in

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
signature theory phase okay

266
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
so p s

267
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
i one denotes the

268
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,920
soft uh problem before signature query

269
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,640
and pf denote the failure probability

270
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
due to signature queries

271
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
the key question is how to have a high

272
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
success probability

273
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
this page is the most important showing

274
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
the key solution in our work

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,040
here pr is the is the probability

276
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,200
if p s star is close and no more than

277
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,279
one over two and the gap between pf1 and

278
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,720
ps1

279
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,959
is constant and small for example as

280
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,880
small as one over q

281
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,760
learn after one signature curate the

282
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
success probability is slightly reduced

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
only okay

284
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,519
one

285
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,600
minus one over q

286
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
we can extend this to q signature q is

287
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,160
not lost

288
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,440
eventually

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
is there constant and small

290
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
okay but how to achieve this

291
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
we found this can be achieved with

292
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
geometric progression

293
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
suppose p f i is equal to 1 over 2 to

294
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
power j

295
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,959
and p s i is equal to the sum of all

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,399
values

297
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,399
on the left side

298
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,200
of

299
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,480
1 over 2 to the power j then no matter

300
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,800
what j is the gap between pfi and psi is

301
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,320
always equal to 1 over 2 to power n plus

302
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,959
1 and we can set this value very close

303
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,880
to 1 over q

304
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
and the sum of all values is close and

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,880
no more than 1 over 2.

306
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,560
so our proof work as it follows for each

307
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
message m there will be n types of hashi

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
q a's

309
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,720
and we will choose a very special

310
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,839
c and not

311
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,440
uniformly and

312
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
c to b will be embedded in response to

313
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
type security with a different

314
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
probability from one over two to one

315
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
plus one to one over two to two

316
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
suppose the integral will make type zero

317
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
type one type key rate

318
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
on matching m before signature q is that

319
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
we will have different results

320
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
we have introduced

321
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
previously

322
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
so

323
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,279
we have uh

324
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,720
this uh important properties

325
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
we have pfi

326
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,680
when

327
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,199
c to power b

328
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,800
uh is embedded in response to type ki

329
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,440
cura on message mi and we have psi

330
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,519
when t2b is embedded in response to any

331
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,920
type ci as long as ci is uh

332
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,440
less than ki okay ki is additively

333
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
chosen by adversity yes but no matter

334
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
what ki is we have the gap of this

335
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
probability is always equal to 1 over 2

336
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,839
to n plus 1

337
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
and for the first changes the other

338
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
version must make all kills and p star

339
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
is

340
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,880
is very close to one over two

341
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,600
and this is the main idea of our title

342
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,920
deduction

343
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,959
with the above approach we can prove

344
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,440
that the chain based vr scheme will have

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
the reduction loss

346
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
four times q to the power one over n and

347
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,000
this loss is constant and small when n

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
is locked in q okay and next we show

349
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,199
that this kind of reduction must be at

350
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,920
least q to power one over n

351
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,720
we use the framework of meta reduction

352
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,639
by a current

353
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
to analyze this kind of optimal loss

354
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
we first should construct a special

355
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,120
hypothetic adversary

356
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
and then we need to simulate this cancel

357
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,800
hypothetical adversary by rewinding

358
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
and if we can efficiently simulate

359
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
distance of atmosphere with error

360
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
probability if some e

361
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,920
then

362
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
the r

363
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
will break the hardness of transform

364
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
with epsilon r minus epsilon e

365
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,920
the meta deduction shows that epsilon r

366
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
cannot be larger than x of e

367
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
otherwise we can run r as an oracle to

368
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
break the hardness assumption

369
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,639
the challenge of this kind of optimal

370
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,519
energy is how to construct this special

371
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,920
hypothetical adversary and how to

372
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,160
simulate this kind of project with other

373
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,920
probability

374
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,880
that's a

375
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,839
detonated value

376
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
we consider a

377
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,800
attribution uh attacking as follows

378
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
a set of message m zeros

379
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,600
are trojans some subset of gender

380
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
messages

381
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,320
will be also shown satisfying uh mi has

382
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
this number of message

383
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
this

384
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
message size setting is to let the error

385
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,759
probability the same no matter how i

386
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,240
programmed the reduction okay

387
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,800
the the hypothetic adversary will first

388
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,000
make our type zero q is a message in m

389
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
zero

390
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,120
the adversary will later make or type

391
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
one curious a message in m1

392
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,279
but before this the

393
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,360
we have make sim jqs or message in

394
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
uh n0 excluding and what

395
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,600
the last uh type um curious is this and

396
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,480
actually it contains a signature of

397
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,720
message m style

398
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,240
because there's no signature queries on

399
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,000
a message and star so the adobe can

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,920
return this as the first change

401
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,640
to simulate such uh hypothetical rate

402
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,520
the main difficulty is how to simulate

403
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,280
or type iqs in red color because this

404
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
has actually contained some block

405
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,679
signatures and they are hard to be

406
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,199
computed without having a cpt

407
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,039
and this problem is of which is

408
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
rewinding and it requires at most n

409
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
types of binding

410
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,120
taking a

411
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,520
t1 m1 as an example

412
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,400
after

413
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,120
the

414
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
the state uh which is

415
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,520
we received the response to has acquired

416
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,559
t type zeroed then before the rewind

417
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,440
we

418
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
will make signature query on our message

419
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,799
in m1

420
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
and then we rewind

421
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
to rewind

422
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
to the state after

423
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,520
uh type geo queries then we will make

424
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
our

425
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
signature queries on our message

426
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
in m zero disclosing m1

427
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,039
if that's not a part by r

428
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,400
then we

429
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
will

430
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
be able to use

431
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,880
uh

432
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,240
the signatures uh mythology rewind

433
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,559
to simulate the type

434
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,120
1 accurate in m1

435
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,360
okay

436
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
the last is to calculate the error

437
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
probability

438
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,120
the error occurs when there is

439
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
an integer i dash

440
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,679
such that before the rewind

441
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,039
r cannot respond to the curious means

442
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,559
that the simulated atmosphere does not

443
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
have the signatures okay

444
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,360
and after rewind the the r can respond

445
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
to this curious it means that the

446
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
simulated adversity has to continue

447
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,520
to

448
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
make the following type

449
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
i dash

450
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,200
type i dash

451
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,280
queries or message in mi-dash

452
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,400
okay

453
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
and

454
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,640
the error probability is equal to these

455
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
two events

456
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
when

457
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,080
i dash is equal to one

458
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,120
we calculate the error probability based

459
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,840
on the setting about how many synches

460
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,120
are reducible in m0 okay

461
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,240
and no matter what n is there is no

462
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,480
arrow or the arrow is less than 1 over

463
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,720
q 2 power 1 of n

464
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
and based on this information and the

465
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,000
result we can calculate that the final

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,320
error probability is equal to

467
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,559
is this which is the

468
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,160
optimal loss

469
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
and this is the high level idea of our

470
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
enemies

471
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,039
conclusion okay how to program a kind of

472
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,440
deduction when speeches are unique

473
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
it's not trivial under

474
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
any non-interactive hacking assumption

475
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,880
in standard security mode against

476
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
general adversary currently the only

477
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
known title reduction for chain based

478
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,760
contraction has reduction loss n times

479
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
this q h to power 1 over n

480
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
and we prove that the optimal loss is

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,120
actually q to power 1 over n

482
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,720
and we show how to obtain such an

483
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,679
optimal block optimal reduction with a

484
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,480
completely different approach

485
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,880
we would like to thank uh people younger

486
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,559
for insightful discussion on the first

487
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,960
version of this work in 2020 and we

488
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
would also like to thank the anonymous

489
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,559
anonymous reviewers from

490
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,600
ec2122 and crypto2d1 for they are very

491
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,840
important and useful comments thank you
