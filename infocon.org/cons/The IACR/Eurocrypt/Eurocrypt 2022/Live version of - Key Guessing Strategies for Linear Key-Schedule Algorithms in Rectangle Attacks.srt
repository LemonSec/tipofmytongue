00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,839
welcome you all in this pre-launch

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,040
session and this session first paper

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,839
title is key guessing strategies for

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,760
linear key signal

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,160
algorithms in rectangle attacks

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,519
and authors are

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,880
xiang

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
down

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,240
this paper

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
hello everyone i'm joyoundo from

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,079
singhuan university

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,600
i'm talking about key guessing

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
strategies for linear case schedule

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,559
algorithms in rectangle attacks

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,360
this work is joined with linguistic

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,199
situation and i'll show you one

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,480
this report has helped us the first part

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,840
includes

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,600
some background and motivations

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
boomerang attacks

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
was proposed by winner

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
they built the boomerang distinguisher

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,479
for eb with two short differentials in e

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,240
and e zero

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
suppose

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,159
the probability so even and the ideal

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,280
are p and q the probability of e b will

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
be the square of p q

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
as remaron attack needs adaptive chosen

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,479
pretext and subtext

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
several improvements converted it into

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,479
chosen playtext attacks

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,320
known as amplified boomerang and the

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,840
rectangle attacks

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
the probability is reduced

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,520
by a factor of two to minus one n

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,079
later many works are proposed to study

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
the probability of pomegranate

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
due to the dependency between the two

40
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,399
short differentials

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,200
such as the pomegranate switch sandwich

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,159
attack

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,479
boomerang connected table and its

44
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,119
improvements

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,878
in the aspects of the recovery framework

46
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
or rectangular attack

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
we have the following three models

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,760
when performing

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
a related key rectangle with linear key

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
scatter we found

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,920
contrast

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,959
means the input differential alpha point

53
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,920
how to

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
satisfy the following two equations

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
uh to be a

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,319
right content

57
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,360
however

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760
they may not hold due to the linear case

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,599
schedule

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,080
we introduce a trade-off

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,000
rectangle attack by guessing the full kb

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
and the partial kf to get more filters

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
before

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,800
generating quarters

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,519
we build our trade-off model

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
for rectangle attacks with linear key

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
schedule

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,519
in algorithm one

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
the first step is to

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,519
collect uh data

71
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
uh construct y structure so

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,280
uh two two rb play text each

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
uh fourth structure

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,640
i

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
query the

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,920
uh 2 to rb play text by encryption under

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,599
k1 k2 case random k4

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,840
store them in different

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,640
tables for each of the axe beat

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,159
key x

81
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
which is part o

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,319
point k one

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,959
uh the first uh

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,840
store a store a key cutter

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,879
initialize a key counter

87
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
for each of the mb

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,159
plus

89
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,000

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,680
eb and ef

93
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
do the following steps

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
and

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
that

96
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
for

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,918
p1 in l1

98
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
we

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
uh divide the derivative

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
uh

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,840
corresponding the

102
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,800
p2 by

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,320
incorruption the decryption process

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
for p3 in l3

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
we found this

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,639
partner reference partner

107
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,639
um

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
it's also uh by encryption

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
uh p3 and o

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,800
a plus alpha and then decrypt

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,840
uh to get p4

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
then restore

113
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,919
p1 p2 in s1

114
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,960
indexed by

115
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
indexed by the

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,199
self-tags

117
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,039
and some internal internal base

118
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,440
this is the sf text

119
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,160
and

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
this is some internabies

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,720
and for a piece

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
through mp4

123
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,919
in s2

124
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
we also

125
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
we also compute some internal bs

126
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
x3 and s4

127
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,600
and by decryption from the

128
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
self-test with some kps

129
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
and in a store

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
the

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
and access

132
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,919
h

133
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,120
to fad the p1 p2

134
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,919
to

135
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,000
generate

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
the

137
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,319
corners then for each corners

138
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,199
uh

139
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
for each generated contrast we determine

140
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,960
other

141
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,240
kbs

142
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
and increase the gain counters

143
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,199
and we select the top

144
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,039
top piece in the case c

145
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,600
and i guess the remaining kb is to

146
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,639
attract 4k

147
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,600
totally we have to

148
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,520
guess mb plus mf and no kbs before

149
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,000
generating the content

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
we guessed mb plus m

151
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,319
f point with k to reduce the memory of

152
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
key quarters we guess x speed kx before

153
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
we initialize kc

154
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,240
computed the

155
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
expected number of red context we

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,880
denoted as

157
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,680
the data complexity is 2

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
is 4y

159
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
2 to rb

160
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,440
we have three time complexities as t1 t2

161
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
and t3

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,720
we will mainly trade off between those

163
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
three time capacity

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
the memory complexity

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,039
includes the key counters and data

166
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,599
structure

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,240
we first we apply our model to graph

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
crop analysis on skinny skinny is

169
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,880
proposed at uh crypto2016

170
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,759
when skinny adopts the twinkie 2k

171
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
framework and spn run function

172
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
we have a few

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
automatic tools for differential or

174
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039

search

176
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
to recent models combine mlp methods and

177
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360

180
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,280
considered boomerang distinguisher and

181
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,639
care cover phase as a uniform

182
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,520
automatic tool

183
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,199
based on previous automatic tool

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
we built a new model to determine

185
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,639
optimize the configurations for our

186
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
trade-off model we have to determine

187
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,639
configurations for

188
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,919
mfm points

189
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
hf h

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,719
the objective function is to minimize

191
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,839
t1 p2 and d3

192
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,719
first

193
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,599
step is to model the propagation of

194
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
cells with known difference in ef

195
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
uh we start from this this

196
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
different this

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,440
this is the end of the distinguisher

198
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
and propagate

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
from acts

200
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,440
27 to the end

201
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
we introduced some

202
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
binary variables

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
such as dxfix and the wfix

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,680
to mark the known differences in

205
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
in xr or wr

206
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
the impact osrn

207
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
sc

208
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
is determined by this equation and the

209
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
factor mc

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
is determined by this equation

211
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,279
we have to model the

212
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,120
sales could be used to filter context in

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,519
ef

214
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
we introduce a banner variables

215
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,640
for as dx filter

216
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
to denote the

217
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
cells in

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
xr which

219
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
can be used to

220
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
to be better

221
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
for example

222
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
source fixed the

223
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
difference

224
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
as input

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
to the sc operation then we get the

226
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
unfixed input

227
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
then

228
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,640
this cell can be used as field we also

229
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,720
introduced the double filter to denote

230
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
the filter in depth r

231
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
for example

232
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
for example

233
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
there are three

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
3 fixed difference

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
in wr and then after mc

236
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
there are only one

237
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
cell

238
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
and

239
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,640
and when we decryption

240
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
when computing mc

241
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,700
inverse

242
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,560
[Music]

243
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
we have two actual

244
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
cells in wr

245
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
with fixed differences as filters

246
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,079
before generating quarters

247
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
we have to guess

248
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,800
partial cells to gain more

249
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
filters we define the x gas and the

250
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
deduplication variables

251
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
we know the cells in wr need to know

252
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,959
includes

253
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
known cells from xr and filters in wr

254
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,640
cells in x r plus 1 need to know

255
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,399
includes no cells from wr and filters in

256
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000

platform

258
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,920
we also model the advantage h

259
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,120
the objective function is to minimize

260
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,040
divide t2 and t3

261
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,639
we found new boomerang distinguishes for

262
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
several worlds so skinny for example all

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
the extinguisher for skinny

264
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,839
128 to

265
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
384 which is

266
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
24 or 20

267
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,240
23 rounds per which is inferred to

268
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,720
previous

269
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,600
24-25 round stitching ratio but we can

270
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
perform

271
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,920
a 32-round skill recovery attack

272
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
which gives two more runs

273
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
we add four round uh eb and the ferrara

274
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
ef

275
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
uh to the

276
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
uh 23a round distinguisher

277
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,920
in

278
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,360
omega zero points uh we collect uh the

279
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
plate uh

280
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,079
structures

281
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,880
and the uh they

282
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
they

283
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,399
uh they

284
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
rewind

285
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
act as self tags

286
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,639
then

287
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
rb

288
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
is

289
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
12c and mb is

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
18 c

291
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
rf is

292
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,319
16c and mf is 24c

293
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
by our automatic tool we determine the

294
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,839
key cells

295
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
should be guessed in advance as kf

296
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
points and

297
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,839
we get

298
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,800
filter as hive

299
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
recite as as one h as

300
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200

2d8

302
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
and we get a balance between t1 t2 and

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,959
h3 the final time is about

304
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,519
2 to

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,000
35 5.

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,279
we also applied to our model to fork

307
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
skinny and

308
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
the access pc and git

309
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,760
or model can also be applied to single

310
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,079
case setting and given i will give an

311
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,360
example

312
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
application to servant

313
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
we compared

314
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,880
those kg cavalry models as follows

315
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,560
before generating quarters uh in attack

316
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
one

317
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,760
we guess

318
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,199
mb and the

319
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,320
f b

320
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
k at once

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,839
in attack two we do not guess nk

322
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,680
in attacks rate

323
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,399
we get only mp in ep and our model

324
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,680
and all model uh guesses handy and

325
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,199
partial

326
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,560
case

327
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,959
yes

328
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,040
so thanks for your attention

329
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,680
any question comments

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,910
okay then we can thank again speaker

331
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,740
[Applause]

332
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,160
you
