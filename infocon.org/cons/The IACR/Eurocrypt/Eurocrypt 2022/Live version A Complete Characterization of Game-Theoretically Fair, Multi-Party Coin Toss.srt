1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
so the last talk of this session is a a

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,720
complete characterization of game

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
theoretic for multi-party coin toss

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,799
regulator of elaine she and kevo and

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,200
this will be a recorded talk and k who

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,919
will give the talk

7
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
videos

8
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,959
hi everyone i'm cool from kanning malay

9
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
university i'll present our work a

10
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
complete characterization of game

11
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,520
theoretically fair multi-party coin

12
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,400
tasks

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
this is a joint work with gil ashara

14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
from bar elon university in elinchi from

15
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,000
cmu

16
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
my advisor elaine and i

17
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
are two co-organizers of the cmu crypto

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
seminar and we need to decide the food

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
for the seminar

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
i prefer sushi while owling prefer cake

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,519
we cannot persuade each other so we

22
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
decide to toss a random coin

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
if the output is zero then i win and

24
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,680
we'll order sushi otherwise a ling wing

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
and we will order cake

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
since we're in different city this week

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
we decided to do bloms coin toss

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
protocol on blockchain

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
we each choose a random bit and post the

30
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
commitment of the random bid on the

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
blockchain

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,519
if you're not familiar with blockchain

33
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
you can think of it as a public bulletin

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
board so after we post the commitments

35
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,359
everyone can see them on the blockchain

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,959
after we both post the commitments we

37
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
each open our random bit and post the

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
opening on blockchain

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
let's say elaine's random bit is zero

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
and my random bit is one

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,239
the output will be the xor of these two

42
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
random bits which is one

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,640
so elaine wins and we will order cake

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
however i really want to eat sushi

45
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
after ellen post her bid on blockchain i

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
know that i'm gonna lose the game if i

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
open my bit

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
so what if i refuse to open my

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
commitments

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
in this case elaine just automatically

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
wins and the outcome would be won so

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,599
still we will order cake

53
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
this is the famous blomscoin host

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
protocol back to 1983.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
it guarantees that a strategic player

56
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
like me cannot bias the output towards

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,918
my preference

58
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,040
formally in the coin toss protocol the

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,520
goal is to output a random coin that is

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
publicly verifiable

61
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
the correctness requires that um if

62
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
everyone is honest

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
then the output should be uniformly

64
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,360
random

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
the fairness notion considered in

66
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
traditional literature

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
is called strong fairness or

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
unbiasability

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,919
which requires that a strategic player

70
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,800
cannot bias the outputs towards either

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
direction

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
unfortunately

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
this is shown to be impossible by cleve

74
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
in 1986.

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
indeed even in bloom's coin toss

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
protocol we just saw i can always bias

77
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
the output towards one

78
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,919
by refusing to open the commitment

79
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
the fairness notion achieved by blum's

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,440
coin hospital is actually more of a game

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
theory favor

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,320
for game theoretic fairness

83
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,800
it requires that a strategic player

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
cannot benefit herself by deviating from

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,039
the protocol

86
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
now that we've seen bloom's coin host

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
protocol which achieves game theoretic

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,479
fairness for two party coin tasks

89
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,680
a natural question to ask is that can we

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
achieve game theoretic fairness for

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,119
multi-party coin tasks

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,759
in multi-party coin toss several players

93
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
get together to toss a binary coin

94
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,199
each player has a preference that is

95
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
publicly available

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
let's say uh for example kittens and i

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
prefer sushi and we call them sushi

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
people

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
while puppies in elaine prefer cake so

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
we call them cake people

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
some of these players will get together

102
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
to form a coalition

103
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,960
they will coordinate with each other and

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,759
try to bias the output to increase their

105
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
utility

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,639
the utility we consider is quite natural

107
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,759
if i like the output i gain utility one

108
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,080
and the utility of a collision is just

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
the sum of the utility of the players in

110
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
this collision

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
for example if the output is cake then

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,639
this collision in the figure means

113
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,080
utility 3

114
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
and if the output is sushi then this

115
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
coalition gain utility 2.

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,960
therefore the preference of a coalition

117
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
is actually the preference of majority

118
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,639
players in this coalition

119
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
now for maori party coin toss the game

120
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,039
theoretic fairness notion we consider is

121
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
slightly different

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
now we care more about the behavior of a

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,960
coalition rather than a strategic player

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
for multi-party coin toss game theoretic

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,160
fairness requires that a collision

126
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
cannot increase its expected utility by

127
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
deviating from the protocol

128
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
so if a coin-host protocol is game

129
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
theoretic fair against coalition of size

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,039
t

131
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,520
then the honest protocol is actually a

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
t-sized coalition-resistant nash

133
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,800
equilibrium because this best strategy

134
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
for the collision is just to follow the

135
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,120
protocol honestly

136
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
so why do we care about this game

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
theoretic fairness

138
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
because we know that strong fairness is

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
impossible against half-sized coalition

140
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
however in many decentralized

141
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
applications for example

142
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,479
voting on a blockchain

143
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,199
many pseudonyms may be controlled by the

144
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,759
same entity and these pseudonyms they

145
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
will coordinate together and they may

146
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,520
deviate from the protocol to gain

147
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
benefit

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
it is very likely that these pseudonyms

149
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
form a majority-sized coalition so we do

150
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,039
need some meaningful fairness notion

151
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,160
that is achievable against a

152
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,000
majority-sized coalition

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
game theoretic fairness is exactly such

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
a notion that is slightly weaker than

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,639
strong fairness yet still meaningful and

156
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,120
suitable for decentralized applications

157
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
um

158
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,199
unfortunately game theoretic fairness

159
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
for a multi-party coin task protocol is

160
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,000
shown to be impossible against a minus

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,880
one-sized coalition due to cleves result

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,760
uh due to chain at all sorry uh

163
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,559
adults result back to 1918.

164
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,679
so a natural question to ask

165
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,399
is that can we achieve game theoretic

166
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,880
fairness for multi-party coin toss

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,760
against small sized coalition

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
let's say majority size but not

169
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
necessarily a minus one

170
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
and the answer is yes

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
to convince you i'll first show you a

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
very simple strumming solution for four

173
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,880
players let's say we have two sushi

174
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,519
people and two cake people

175
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
in the straw man solution each group

176
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
first arbitrarily choose a

177
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,959
representative let's say it's the kitten

178
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,040
and the puppy

179
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
then these two representatives do with

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
each other using blum's coin host

181
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
protocol

182
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
the output of this blums called protocol

183
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
will be the coin for four-party coin

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
tasks

185
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,680
so this very simple protocol is getting

186
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,600
theoretically fair against coalition of

187
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
size 2.

188
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
note that if the coalition contains one

189
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,480
sushi person and one cake person

190
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
then this coalition actually has no

191
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
preference and they can never increase

192
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,600
their expected utility so we don't care

193
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,880
what they do to the coin

194
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
if the coalition contains two sushi

195
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,399
people

196
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,120
then by bombs coin toss protocol

197
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
the sushi representative cannot bias the

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
output what sushi

199
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
and so this coalition cannot benefit by

200
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
deviating from the protocol

201
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,200
the same argument works for the case if

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
the coalition continues to kick people

203
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
so we can achieve game theoretic

204
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
fairness for four-party coin toss

205
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
against coalition of size two

206
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,640
this isn't evidence that it is true

207
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
that we can achieve game theoretic

208
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
fairness for some meaningful parameter

209
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
region

210
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
actually this very simple german idea

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360
generalizes to any number of players as

212
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
long as the coalition is outside at

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
those two

214
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
so on the achievability side for a

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
collision of size less than half

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
we can achieve strong fairness

217
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
and of course game theoretic variants

218
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,120
through multi-party computation

219
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
if the collision is of size smaller than

220
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,079
2

221
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
then we can use this drawing solution

222
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
on the impossibility side

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,079
turn at all showed that it is impossible

224
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,920
to achieve game theoretic fairness

225
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
against a minus one sized collision

226
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,160
so

227
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,959
we ask the question under what size of

228
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,160
coalition

229
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
is it possible to achieve game theoretic

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
fairness

231
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
exactly where should we draw the line

232
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,760
the boundary between feasibility and

233
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
invisibility

234
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,279
this work answers this question

235
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
we explored the broad range of

236
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
parameters of collision size between

237
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,519
half and n minus one

238
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,560
so in this work we give a complete

239
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
characterization of game theoretic

240
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
fairness

241
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
we give a

242
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
construction of a game theoretic fair

243
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
coin toss protocol against team-sized

244
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
coalition

245
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
and we show that game theoretic fairness

246
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
as impossible against t plus one size

247
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
coalition

248
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,079
um i'll give the expression of t to you

249
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,279
later

250
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,160
so

251
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
in the rest of the talk we will mainly

252
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,920
focus on the construction of the

253
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
protocol

254
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
still to convey the main idea we will

255
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
use a simple example of six players

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
three sushi people and three cake people

257
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
the structure is quite simple we let the

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
sushi people choose a random going as

259
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,279
zero

260
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
and then we let the cake people choose a

261
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,279
random point s1

262
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,839
the output will just be the xor of these

263
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
two random bits

264
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
but where do the random coin s0 and s1

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
come from

266
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
so for easier understanding we assume a

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,079
secret sharing trusted authority

268
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,320
parameterized with k

269
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,440
that choose a random queen s for us

270
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
and satisfy the following properties

271
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,480
first only k or more players can ask the

272
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,760
authority to reveal the value of s

273
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
and second any k or more players can

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,360
choose to rewrite the value of s before

275
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,760
any reveal request

276
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
as a heads-up this trusted authority can

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
be implemented by standard crypto

278
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
and we do not need to assume trusted

279
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,200
authority in our final protocol

280
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
so this trusted authority is just um for

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
better understanding during the talk

282
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
with this trusted authority our protocol

283
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
works as follows

284
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,600
first each group has a trusted authority

285
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
with parameter case set to be two

286
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,480
the sushi authority first choose a

287
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,040
random queen at zero

288
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
and then if and then if the collision

289
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
wants to rewrite the value of coin at

290
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,720
zero it has to be now

291
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,279
then the cake authority choose a random

292
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,800
coin s1

293
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
still if the coalition wants to rewrite

294
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,680
the value of s1 it has to be at this

295
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,800
point

296
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,479
no rewrite is allowed after

297
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
then sushi people sends reveal requests

298
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,920
to the trusted authority to reveal the

299
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,440
value of s0 on blockchain

300
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,199
then the kick people send reveal

301
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,519
requests to kick authority to reveal the

302
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,800
value of s1 on blockchain

303
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,360
if both coin revealed successfully the

304
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
output is the xor of these two random

305
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
coins

306
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
however if s0 is not revealed because

307
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,399
two or more sushi people refuse to

308
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,760
reveal

309
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
but coin s1 is successfully revealed on

310
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,279
the blockchain then in this case the

311
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
output of the protocol is just the coin

312
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
s1

313
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,959
on the other hand if the coin s0 is

314
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,920
revealed but s1 is not revealed what

315
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
should we output

316
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
should we output s0

317
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
so definitely not

318
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
we should output 0 instead of s0

319
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,800
this is because by the time when the

320
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,959
sushi people decides whether they want

321
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,480
to reveal s1 they already see the value

322
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,199
of s0 on the blockchain

323
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,160
so

324
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
even if a collision of only two cake

325
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,680
people

326
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,399
they can bias the output by deciding

327
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
whether they want to reveal the coin s1

328
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
after they saw the value of s0 on the

329
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,639
blockchain

330
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,040
this means that if we choose to output

331
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,720
s0 if s1 fails to be revealed then we

332
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
will only be able to tolerate collision

333
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,839
of size 1.

334
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,839
so instead we will output 0 as a heavier

335
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,839
punishment for the kick people if they

336
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
refuse to reveal the value of s1

337
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,360
so this six player coin toss protocol

338
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,199
actually achieves game theoretic

339
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
fairness against coalition of size up to

340
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,880
four

341
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
to see this

342
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,639
if this collision contains two sushi

343
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
people and two cake people

344
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,880
they actually have no preference

345
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
and they can never in because they can

346
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
never increase their utilities so we

347
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,399
don't care what they do to the coin

348
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
if the collision contains three sushi

349
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
people and a single kick person

350
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
then this coalition can decide the value

351
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,680
of estero because they can rewrite the

352
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,120
coin

353
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
however as we mentioned when they

354
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,839
rewrite the coin s0 they know nothing

355
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,360
about s1

356
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,639
so the coin s1 is still an independent

357
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,360
uniformly random coin chosen by the cake

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
authority

359
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,440
that is guaranteed to be revealed due to

360
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
the two honest cake people so if the

361
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,079
coalition choose to reveal coin as 0

362
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,120
then the output should be serial xor

363
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,839
with s1

364
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
if we choose not to reveal s0

365
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,000
at the time when they decide whether

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
they want to choose uh reveal s0 they

367
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
know nothing about coin s1

368
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,279
so the output is an independent

369
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,759
uniformly random point s1 shown by the

370
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,079
cake authority

371
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
on the other hand if the coalition

372
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
contains three cake people and a single

373
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
social person

374
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
by a similar argument

375
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,119
they can control the value of point s1

376
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
at the time when they know nothing about

377
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,559
s0

378
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,119
so if they choose to reveal s1 the

379
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,720
output would be s0 xor with s1 which is

380
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,679
uniformly random

381
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
if they choose not to reveal s1

382
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
then the output will directly be zero

383
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
i believe smart as they are they will

384
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,799
never do this because this brings them

385
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,600
no benefit

386
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,799
so

387
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,360
this protocol is game theoretically fair

388
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
against coalition of size 4.

389
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
can we generalize it

390
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
and the answer is positive

391
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
this idea actually generalizes to

392
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
arbitrary number of players

393
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,679
and this table gives the maximum size of

394
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,919
the coalition we can tolerate with this

395
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,280
protocol

396
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
in this table m1 is the number of kick

397
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
people and n0 is the number of sushi

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
people

399
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,080
for simplicity i ignored the ronnie here

400
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,960
and without loss of generality we assume

401
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,799
n1 is at least n zero

402
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,520
and this is the landscape of the

403
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
achievability and ancient ability of

404
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
game theoretic fairness

405
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
it turns out that the landscape of game

406
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,039
theoretic fairness is darkly different

407
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,520
from the de facto strong fairness

408
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
in this plot the x-axis denotes the

409
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
number of sushi people in the y-axis

410
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
denotes the number of kick people

411
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,960
the z-axis here is the size of the

412
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
coalition

413
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,720
this red plane is the boundary between

414
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,120
visibility and invisibility of game

415
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
theoretic fairness

416
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
for any region below this red plane we

417
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,400
can achieve game theoretic fairness

418
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,679
and for any region above we cannot

419
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
as a comparison this blue plane is the

420
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
boundary of invisibility and visibility

421
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
for strong fairness which is exactly

422
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,320
half

423
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
of the number of players

424
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
from this figure we can see that there

425
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,600
is indeed a meaningful region

426
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
for which we can achieve game theoretic

427
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,280
fairness but not strong fairness

428
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,240
and moreover we can see that

429
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
the achievability of game theoretic

430
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,799
fairness is not only related to the size

431
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
of the coalition but also the

432
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
relationship between the number of sushi

433
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,640
people and the number of cake people

434
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
to wrap up in this work we give a game

435
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,440
theoretically fair coin toss protocol

436
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
against his science coalition and we

437
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
show that game theoretic fairness is

438
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,039
impossible against any t plus one sized

439
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,320
coalition

440
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
and t is summarizing the table below

441
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
here n1 is the number of cake people and

442
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,320
n0 is the number of sushi people

443
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,200
when m1 is much larger than n zero then

444
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,440
we can tolerate coalition of size up to

445
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,159
a one minus half and zero

446
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,640
moreover if m one equal to n zero and

447
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
they're equal to odd then we can

448
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,039
tolerate n zero plus one sized

449
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,520
coefficient as in the six clear example

450
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
we just saw

451
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,520
otherwise we can tolerate a coalition of

452
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
size up to two-thirds and one plus

453
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,479
one-third and zero

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
in the work

455
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
we also give other results we give a

456
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,919
complete characterization of another

457
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,880
fairness notion which requires that no

458
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
coalition can harm any honest individual

459
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
we also give complete characterization

460
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,720
of these two fairness notion on their

461
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,480
other natural utility functions

462
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,640
and this is the reference for the paper

463
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
mentioning the talk

464
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
and thank you if you're interested in

465
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,520
more details of the paper you can read

466
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
our paper which is posted on eprine or

467
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
write me email

468
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,120
that's my talk thank you so much

469
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,799
i believe that gilad should be available

470
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,158
for questioning the questions

471
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,640
yes i'm here if you have any questions

472
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,880
glad

473
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
can you say when the game theoretic

474
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,159
scenario is uh

475
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,440
reasonable

476
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
when people have to declare in advance

477
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,480
what's your preferences

478
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
um so we give few examples where this is

479
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
uh

480
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
this is maybe reasonable

481
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,919
i agree that it's also interesting to

482
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,960
discuss the case where um

483
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
you don't know the preferences in

484
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
advance

485
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,320
one example that we gave is like let's

486
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,520
say we do some voting or like we need to

487
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
cause uh

488
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,960
just a coin

489
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
uh well we do know the preferences of

490
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,960
each other let's say we need to decide

491
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
what is

492
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,799
how to um

493
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,000
in in some

494
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,480
in some

495
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,720
let's say uh we want to do

496
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,039
um

497
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
we have two possible candidates and we

498
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,679
want that the candidate that is closer

499
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,640
to my geographically um

500
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
that's closer to me geographically will

501
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
be the the winner

502
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
then because you know where i'm located

503
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,720
you know who i prefer

504
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
or if you have like uh

505
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,080
you want to fund two candidates and you

506
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,159
know we have like a public forum where

507
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,440
you can actually

508
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
can estimate what is the the preference

509
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
of each one of the

510
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
participants

511
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
but in that case it is

512
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
a question like would you actually toss

513
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,400
a coin or just run majority vote

514
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
but yeah this is a natural question i

515
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
think

516
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
any other questions hello

517
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
hello um i want to ask if this easily

518
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,960
generalizes to like um dice rolling or

519
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,600
like more than more dice rolling not not

520
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
only two outputs but like more i don't

521
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
know

522
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,360
oh we did think about in the beginning

523
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,439
we had some initial results um

524
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,720
it is quite similar to the

525
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
to the normal to the regular like

526
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,200
generalization of

527
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,760
from two to from uh

528
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
from a coin to like uh

529
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
more than just two results

530
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
um

531
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,960
but i think the characterization will be

532
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
completely different so

533
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,600
it is a good question to explore

534
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,320
okay thank you

535
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
if there are no

536
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
other questions so let's say speak again

537
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,199
at the speaker of the session

538
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,600
thank you
