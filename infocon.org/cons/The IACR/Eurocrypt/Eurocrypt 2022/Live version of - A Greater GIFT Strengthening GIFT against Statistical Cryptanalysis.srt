1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,440
okay um

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,240
the next slide

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,160
our next big our next speaker is

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,199
this is the technical problem session

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
this tcc community is trying to meddle

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,599
with us

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,480
oh

8
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
our next presentation is going to be a

9
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,200
greater gift struggling gift against

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
statistical cryptognosis by ling soon

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
bart prenil

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,439
and ling is going to

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,320
present by recording

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
hello everyone the name of the

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,680
presentation is a greater gift

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
strengthening gift against third taste

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
they call crypt analyze

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
let's start with the motivation of this

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,520
work

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
the work in this paper is inspired from

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,520
the automatic searching results related

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,680
to differential and linear crypt

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
analysis of gifts 6a4

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,719
we first look into the server in itself

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
and try to discover more properties

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
apart from the quantitative information

27
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,840
about activist boxes

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
differential probabilities and linear

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
correlations

30
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,319
in the second part given the gap between

31
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
the upper bounds on the differential

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,520
probability and the linear correlation

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,400
we wonder whether we can find the virus

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
with analogous security levels under the

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
differential and linear settings

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,200
now we briefly reveal some preliminaries

37
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
gift is a family of lightweight block

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
servers proposed by benny cat all

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,200
we consider gift 64 which is a 64-bit

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,360
block server with 128k

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
and with 28 rounds

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
each round consists of three steps

43
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
the subsail operation applies a an

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,080
invertible 4 bit xbox to a label of the

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
server state

46
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
then the perm bit operation permits the

47
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,599
state in a bit oriented manner

48
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,959
following that

49
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,920
the up front k operation adds the round

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,840
k and the round

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,480
constant gift was designed at 10 years

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,519
after the publication of present

53
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
it has much increased efficiency in

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
hardware and software implementations

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
and this is realized by using an s-box

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
with a lower implementation cost

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
at the same time to avoid consecutive

58
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
one-to-one differential and linear

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,799
transitions in the server the design of

60
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
the beat permutation is carefully

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,839
studied

62
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
the 16x boxes are grouped into two

63
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,680
different ways

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
the first one is the quotient group and

65
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,760
the second one is the remainder group

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,080
with this notation the design of the

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,640
64-bits permutation is converted into

68
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
the construction of four independent and

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
identical 16-bit permutations

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,839
that maps the output bits of the

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,880
quotient group to the input bits of the

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
remainder group

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
the voda paradigm is a guideline for the

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,880
creation of the 16-bit group mapping

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,000
it considers the one-to-one big ddt of

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
the s-box

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,919
and displays the input and output

78
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,120
positions into four sets

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
notice that a bad output could come from

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
a one-to-one bit transition through a

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
certain xbox in the current round

82
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
to ensure that the exciting one to one

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
bit transition will not have had to

84
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,560
another one to one bit transition in the

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
succeeding round the differential botf

86
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
permutation artificially maps the active

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
bits of the potentially bad output

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
to an active bits of some good inputs in

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
the next round

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
similarly in the linear case the linear

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
boj implementation can be derived

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
regarding the one to one bit lat

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
the bogr permutation should be

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
differential and linear bujl

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,600
permutations simultaneously

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,280
for gift the boji permutation is fixed

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
as a identity mapping

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
now we introduce the first part of this

99
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,720
work and give theoretical explanations

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
on differential and linear properties of

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,880
gif 6a4

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,759
0 analyzing the automatic searching

103
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
results related to differential group

104
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,440
analyze

105
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
we observe that the minimum number of

106
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
differential active s-boxes sd

107
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
is linearly dependent on r for all are

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
greater than 7.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
further after decoding the optimal

110
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
differential characteristics

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
with the maximum probability from the

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
output of the set server

113
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,440
they observed that the optimal

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,960
characteristics covering more than seven

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,400
rounds always have two active s-boxes in

116
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
each round

117
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
so we wonder is there a characteristic

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
with a single active s box in some

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
rounds achieving the maximum

120
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
differential probability

121
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
to answer this question we first

122
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,880
consider a small set of differential

123
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
characteristics d1

124
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
the characteristics in this set has have

125
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,919
at least one round activating a single

126
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,120
xbox

127
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
and the input difference of the active

128
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,160
xbox equals 1

129
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
they managed to calculate the lower

130
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,080
bound on the number of active x-boxes

131
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,840
for characteristics in this set

132
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,639
the automatic method is applied to

133
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,080
accomplish this task and we split the

134
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,639
search into three steps

135
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
in the first step

136
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
they explore the lower bound four

137
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,280
characteristics with input difference

138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
having a single non-very for being one

139
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,919
then the characteristics with output

140
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,560
difference having a single non-zero

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,919
level taking one are considered

142
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,560
in the third step we note that the

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,919
characteristics in demand can be created

144
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
with the characteristics in the first

145
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,680
two steps

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
so the lower bound for characteristics

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
in this set is derived from the

148
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,160
experimental results in the first two

149
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,319
steps

150
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,199
the experimental results revealed that

151
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
lower bound on the set event is strictly

152
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
higher than the original bound when the

153
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,720
number of rounds is greater than 7

154
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,479
the same result holds for all sets d i

155
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,479
without taking any non-zero neighbor

156
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
so we draw the vertical proposition

157
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
if r greater than 7 the optimal iron

158
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
differential characteristic of gift 64

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,839
with the minimum number of activist

160
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,519
boxes must have two active s-boxes in

161
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,760
each round

162
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,479
a then with a similar analyzing

163
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
regarding the

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,279
differential probability we give the

165
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,440
second proposition

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
if r greater than 7 the optimal around

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
differential characteristic with the

168
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,519
maximum probability must activate at

169
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,279
least 2 x boxes per round

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
now it seems that differential

171
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,800
characteristics activating two as boxes

172
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
in each round there is a crucial rule in

173
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,839
the security evaluation for gift 64.

174
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
so we wonder whether we can enforce more

175
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
properties of these characteristics

176
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,920
apart from the quantitative information

177
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,200
about activeness boxes

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
before looking into these

179
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,000
characteristics we first devised an

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
alternative description for the round

181
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,680
function

182
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,560
in the alternative description we keep

183
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,920
sub cells and add round k operations and

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,720
further decompose permabeats operation

185
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,200
into two sample versions

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,160
the group maps operation invokes a

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,000
16-bit permutation and independently

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,920
applied it on each of the quotient group

189
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,640
the following transnaval operation works

190
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
enable

191
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,839
this alternative description is called a

192
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
bit oriented one

193
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,800
if we recognize the cipher state as a

194
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
four multiply four metric of labels

195
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
the bit oriented description can be

196
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
replaced with the label oriented one

197
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,440
the nibble oriented description is more

198
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
concise and facilitates the following

199
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
analyze

200
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,680
now giving a differential

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,000
characteristics with two active x-boxes

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,959
per round they assume that the two

203
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,279
activist box in the asron are located in

204
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
the same column and donate the

205
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
differential propagation of the group

206
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
mapping on this column as this

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,959
we show that this propagation should

208
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,600
meet four conditions so that the

209
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,000
differential characteristic based on

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,680
eight consistent two activist boxes in

211
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,760
round r minus one and r plus one

212
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
in other words these are necessary

213
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
conditions for publications in long

214
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
differential characteristics with two

215
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
active as boxes per round

216
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,480
summarizing or analyzing the proof of

217
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
four conditions

218
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,040
we derive the third proposition

219
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,399
for an iron differential characteristic

220
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,839
activating two s boxes per round if the

221
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
two active s boxes in the earth round

222
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
are located in the same column then for

223
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
all i basis in equality the two activist

224
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,040
boxes in the r plus two s rounds are

225
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
located in the same column

226
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,600
then they derive a lemma which tells the

227
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,639
head of the target characteristic

228
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
for the cipher if a differential

229
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
characteristic activates two x boxes per

230
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,240
round then the two activist boxes in one

231
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
of the first two rounds must be located

232
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,320
in the same column of the magic state

233
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
based on lemma 1 and the proposition 3

234
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,839
they conclude that all differential

235
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,040
characteristics with two activist boxes

236
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,399
per round can be decomposed into several

237
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,680
pieces of two round characteristics

238
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,720
for which the two actives boxes in the

239
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
first round are located in the same

240
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
column

241
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,839
furthermore the differential

242
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,079
purposes abstracted from these two round

243
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,480
characteristics fulfills four conditions

244
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
on the other side the characteristics

245
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
with two activist boxes per round can be

246
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,600
constructed artificially

247
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
consider two differential propagations

248
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
validating four conditions

249
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
if gamma i to r5 brand are possible

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,279
transitions

251
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,079
then the two propagations are said to be

252
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,720
compatible with each other

253
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
as shown in the figure we can craft long

254
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,880
differential characteristics activating

255
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,399
two as boxes per round with compatible

256
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,639
propagations

257
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,760
we implement a test and fund 26

258
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,160
propagations validating four conditions

259
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,639
then we evaluate the compatibilities

260
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,519
among them and illustrate the result in

261
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,360
the figure

262
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
after removing some isolated nodes and

263
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
short parts

264
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,519
we note that the graph contains several

265
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,800
cycles

266
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,160
on the one hand these cycles

267
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,639
theoretically expand the existence of

268
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,360
long differential characteristics with

269
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,880
two active x-boxes per round

270
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,600
on the other hand accompanied by the

271
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
preceding analysis we conclude that any

272
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
differential characteristics covering

273
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
more than seven rounds with two active s

274
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,920
boxes per round must utilize certain

275
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,519
passes in the figure

276
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
in addition the cycle also enables us to

277
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,839
enumerate all optimal differential

278
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
characteristics by hand

279
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
they propose an explicit formula for the

280
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
differential probability of the optimal

281
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
characteristic

282
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
and the proof that there are 288

283
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
optimal characteristics with an odd

284
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
number of drones and 10

285
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
and 400 optimal characteristics with an

286
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,440
even number of rounds

287
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,160
in parallel to the case of differential

288
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
setting we derive some analytic results

289
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
in the linear setting

290
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
similarly we show that if r is greater

291
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,399
than 9 the optimal iron linear

292
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,680
characteristic of gift 64

293
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
the minimum number of active s boxes

294
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,440
must activate two xboxes per round

295
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
the linear correlation bond is also

296
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,760
studied however an unlike the case in

297
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,560
differential setting the optimal linear

298
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199
characteristic with the maximum

299
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,240
correlation can contain characteristics

300
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,959
with a single activex box in some realms

301
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,560
we check the properties of linear

302
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,480
characteristics with two as active as

303
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
boxes in each round

304
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,320
and then that this characteristics also

305
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
can be constructed artificially

306
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
we found 46 useful linear propagations

307
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
and unless compatibilities among them

308
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,279
based on the cycle in the graph we also

309
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,560
theoretically explain the existence of

310
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,519
long linear characteristics with two

311
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,959
activist boxes per round

312
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
next we turn to the question proposed in

313
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,839
the first beginning

314
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
can we improve get 64.

315
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,079
note that there are two thousand three

316
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,959
hundred and four group mappings meet all

317
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,800
requirements for the binding gift 64

318
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
so

319
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
they managed to find the virus

320
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
constructed with a new group mapping

321
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,079
that processes comparable upper bounds

322
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,639
on the differential probability and

323
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,639
linear correlation

324
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,759
to reduce the number of candidates we

325
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,680
implemented classification population 7

326
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,199
points of

327
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,680
sufficient condition for two variants

328
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,560
being equivalent to each other

329
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,000
based on this proposition we define an

330
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,959
equivalence relation on the set of all

331
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,559
gives 64 lakh savers and partition the

332
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,280
set into 168

333
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
equivalence classes

334
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
therefore we only need to check the

335
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,599
property of one representative in each

336
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,640
possible equivalence classes and the

337
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,039
number of candidates is reduced from

338
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,520
2303 to 167

339
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
we apply the automatic method to search

340
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
for upper bounds on differential

341
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,000
probabilities and linear correlations of

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,320
167 representative variants

343
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
the test results are illustrated in the

344
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,400
figure

345
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
it can be noticed that the security of

346
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
gift 64 against the differential crypto

347
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,919
analysis is moderate among all

348
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,600
representatives

349
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,480
and the capability against linear

350
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
cryptanalyze

351
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,960
is almost among the best of candidates

352
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
then they consider the combination of

353
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
differential and linear properties

354
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
according to the length of the optimal

355
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,520
effective differential and linear

356
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,160
characteristics

357
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,679
the 168

358
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,000
representatives can be divided into 17

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
groups

360
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,640
the performance of gifts 64 resisting

361
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,520
differential and linear attacks is good

362
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
and the 40 representatives achieve

363
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,200
similar security levels to gift 64.

364
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,160
moreover they identify that one

365
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
representative may achieve comparable

366
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
security level against differential and

367
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,160
linear group analysis and its optimal

368
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
effective differential and linear

369
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,919
characteristics achieves 12 runs

370
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
we donate this equivalence class as gift

371
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,120
64 2021

372
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,679
this equivalence class contains

373
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,520
24 elements and all variants share the

374
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,880
same differential and linear properties

375
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
as in the figure comparing to give the

376
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
6a4 the new wirings have comparable

377
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,000
upper bounds on differential probability

378
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,880
and linear correlation

379
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
the clustering effects of differential

380
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
and linear characteristics are evaluated

381
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,640
similarly to the case of 5th 64th the

382
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,039
differential and linear half properties

383
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,120
of the new variants are not significant

384
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
beyond that we implement the automatic

385
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
search of the impossible differential

386
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,679
distinguishers

387
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,000
are correlation linear distinguishers

388
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
and integral distinguishers for the

389
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,919
variance

390
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
the experimental results indicate that

391
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
the security levels of the variance with

392
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
standing in possible differential attack

393
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,280
zero correlation linear attack and the

394
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,000
integral attack are similar to those of

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
gift 64.

396
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
note that the best attack on new

397
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
violence achieve 18 rounds which is two

398
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,360
rounds less than the length of the best

399
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,919
attack on gift 64.

400
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
we claim that for the variant if the

401
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
security in the related care tech

402
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,520
setting is not required 26 rounds could

403
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
be used rather than 28 rounds

404
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,480
for the simple and clean design strategy

405
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,440
gift offers extremely good performance

406
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
and even surpasses both skinny and

407
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,559
salmon for ground-based implementations

408
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,600
as in the table we compare the hardware

409
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,960
performance the new virus achieves hair

410
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,159
throughput and requires a lower energy

411
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,200
consumption than gift 64.

412
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,120
on this basis the 26 round virus may

413
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,679
become one of the most energy efficient

414
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,200
servers as of today and is

415
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,480
probably more suitable for the lower

416
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,840
energy consumption use cases than give

417
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,919
64.

418
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,880
now we give a conclusion

419
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,640
the paper started 564 with both

420
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,200
automatic measures and mathematical

421
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,039
analyze this hybrid method uncovers new

422
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,799
insects into the security of 5064

423
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,200
and the sum of experiments

424
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
gift 64 we proved some properties of

425
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,440
differential characteristics activating

426
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,760
two x-boxes per round

427
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
so that all optimal differential

428
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
characteristics takes covering more than

429
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
seven rounds with the maximum

430
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,280
probability can be constructed manually

431
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,000
this has the properties of linear

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,039
characteristics with two active s boxes

433
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,400
per round are also provided

434
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
in the second part we find variants with

435
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,799
analogous security levels under the

436
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
differential and linear settings and

437
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,320
show that the 26th round variant may

438
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
become one of the most energy efficient

439
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,440
staffers as of the day

440
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,840
as to the filter work firstly if one is

441
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
concerned with related care attack they

442
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,280
conjecture that the resistance of the

443
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,080
virus regarding related k differential

444
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,039
attack can be lifted by carefully

445
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,360
correcting the case schedule

446
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,640
secondly the cases where the group

447
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,600
mappings operating on different columns

448
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,799
are distinct is an open problem

449
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,840
lastly checking the existence of a

450
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,600
balanced variance for gift 128

451
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,120
will be interesting filter work

452
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
that's all for the presentation thank

453
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,399
you for your attention

454
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
so while we're trying to figure out if

455
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,520
we have one of the

456
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
speakers online

457
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,918
or present in the audience

458
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,000
just a second are there any questions

459
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,919
so i have a question for you bart unless

460
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,440
we find the

461
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,919
link online

462
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,000
the tables and all the analysis what are

463
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
the success rates for the attacks that

464
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
are reported there

465
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
give or take

466
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,799
i'll have to look it up like probably

467
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,720
fifty percent or so i have to look it up

468
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,159
and check with the others again because

469
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
this is this is a while ago but

470
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
thank you are there other questions

471
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,000
do we have one of them

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
if not

473
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,279
see you in the next session in 25

474
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,360
minutes

475
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
and remember there is a membership

476
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,760
meeting we should be there
