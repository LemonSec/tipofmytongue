1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,359
okay let's start the next session uh the

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,720
fourth session on post quantum

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,359
cryptography

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,440
so the first talk in the session is

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,679
about the anonymity of nistpqc round

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
three chems by keita sargava

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,160
thank you for introduction so can you

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
hear me

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,119
yes

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,160
okay

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
let me start

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,000
so thank you for the introductions i am

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
jetta server from entity social

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
informatics laboratories so today so i

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
want to talk about anonymity of gems in

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,760
needs to picture standardization they

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,840
are following the maram

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,520
stroke so let me first talk about

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
background

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
so we know that several companies and

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,559
organizations have been developing

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,559
quantum computers so for example so

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,079
google ibm and ucsd and so on so they

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
constructed approximately 100 physical

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,320
cubits called the machines

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,399
so google plans to develop

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
one million physical tribute machine in

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
2030 and ibm plans to develop first 4000

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,600
physical qubits machine in 2015

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
and we also know that the schwarz

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
algorithm solves the factoring problem

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
and the distributed wiring problem in

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
polymer time over condom machines

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
and in addition to according to disney

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
and regardless estimations so if the

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,320
error rate is uh

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,119
0.1 percent and it runs with about

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,640
one kilohertz

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
then so it can factor the 248 bit rs

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,400
modulus by using the two at 20 million

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
physical tubes in eight hours

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
so that's so if adversary has

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,079
efficiently uh

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
has exchanged scalable quantum computers

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,840
so then the current public key

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
cryptography will be broken

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,759
and the counter measures are in the

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,920
right hand side so the one promising

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
counter measure is the post quantum

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
chemotherapy so pgc in short

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,399
so therefore the nist in the u.s have

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
been standardized

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
and pgc's primitives so here so we have

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
chems and signatures

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
fourth uh

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
injection mechanism and signatures so

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
four teams so they select the four

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
finalists and five alternates

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,480
uh in the left-hand side

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
so while and i

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,040
need to say that they would announce the

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
result in march but we don't share the

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
result yet

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
so the standard

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,879
so here so we consider the security of

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,760
the games scheme

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
and the standard security notion for pke

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,239
and kemp is indistinguishability against

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,239
the children's hypothesis attacks so the

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,920
left hand side there

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
and all new speech language requiems

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
achieved industrial security in the

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
landmark model a classical random local

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
model so roughly speaking so the

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,519
industrial security implies that we

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
cannot distinguish

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
a ciphertext to the real key and the

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
random key

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,440
so this case there is a real key and

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,879
keywords randomly

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,560
in the chem context

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
so unfortunately the industry security

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,360
doesn't improve the response privacy so

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
for example so let us constantly chem

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
scheme whose scientists contain the

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
public key

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
so in this case

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
so it can achieve industry security but

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
such scientists apparently reveals the

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
response

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
so therefore so we consider an anonymity

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,920
so some uh

93
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,640
anonymity against the children's

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,920
attacks

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
so this captures the privacy of

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
lifespans so because that uh so if the

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
automatically

98
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,319
so two encryption key ek there on the

99
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,400
eq1 but so

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,879
it cannot distinguish which encryption

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
key is used to generate ciphertext and

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,000
key so this is a define this defines

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
anonymity of the

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
chem stream

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
so they have a lot of applications of

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
anonymity uh for example anonymous

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
credential and auction and anonymous

108
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,480
authentic encryption and so on

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
so privacy enhancing technologies so uh

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
we have a natural question about so

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,239
whether the chem charge data

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,879
institutions we achieve

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
this anonymity uh anonymity is a

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
contemporary underground model also

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,840
because we concern the pgc

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
so this is a

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
the summary of this result in graphs

118
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,800
malam and pedosum so in this eurocrypt

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
so they're studying a natural question

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
obtain the following tables

121
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
so this shows that the uh variant of

122
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,320
flow this f4 with impressed rejection

123
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,360
has a

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,600
dynamic anonymity

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
and so

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,440
it

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
with a robust hybrid pks

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
but unfortunately so there's a lot of

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
problems on four finalists so for

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
example the classic materialist doesn't

131
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
have a anonymity

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
and the kaiba and the saber has no

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,400
anonymity results and n2 has no army

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
digits

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
they fortunately showed that for the

136
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,639
game satisfies the industrial security

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
and anonymity in europe and collision

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,479
freezes

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,199
the

140
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
results hybrid

141
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,840
pk is also satisfying

142
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,880
anonymity but unfortunately so we don't

143
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,039
know nothing on

144
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
four finalists

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
on anonymities

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
so what's the problem so the problem is

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,919
uh

148
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,160
so roughly speaking so we need to

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
simulate two

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,440
the capsulation molecule and decreasing

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
workload

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,280
so in the case of classical materials so

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,160
the

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
they have a an obstacle that so the

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
classical matrix is not collision free

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,919
and in the intro case so m3 uses sxy so

157
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,120
she's used as h over m as uh to generate

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,639
t so this is an obstacle uh

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,960
to apply their techniques

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
and in addition so they found that the

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,880
tweaks of a rule in kyber and sabre are

162
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
obstacles to showing that their

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,440
anonymity and even their industry

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
security was also according to this

165
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,160
table so we know nothing on anonymity or

166
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
for finance or mr big strands

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
okay

168
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,280
so i'm following a graph that was a

169
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
study so we showed that

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
the following result

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
so we use a strong pseudonyms instead of

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
a anonymous anime anonymity

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
so at first we showed that the strongest

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,199
anomalies

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
immediately implied anonymity

176
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,120
and the next so we showed that that

177
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,639
for

178
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,520
camden frameworks for strong random

179
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
hybrid pks

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,600
so roughly spacing so we

181
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
showed that the sprc came with increased

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
rejection has uh some apple some

183
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,080
additional property

184
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,160
uh implies that such expiry hybrid pa

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,319
and then so we have an anonymous pk

186
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
hybrid pk

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,160
so on lostness we omit the details but

188
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
we can use the robustness results of

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,759
grabs eduardo

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
and third so we saw that

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
as a strongly distanced metal

192
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
simulator pk implies us

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
so spr

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,720
such strong strong game schemes

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
and so forth so we apply them to an

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
institution and slicken

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
and then we obtain this result

198
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
so fortunately so we

199
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
show we can show that the

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
anonymity of classical matrix

201
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
and the anonymity of hybrid pk also

202
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
other

203
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,080
uh today's summary sets that so

204
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
it fails to achieve a robustness apk

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
and we show that in truth you need to

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
like this one and the bike is juicy and

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,039
uh into the intro

208
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,560
and prime on the side

209
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
so unfortunately so it's you see uh

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
the one parameter of hqc uh that doesn't

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
achieve the anonymity also because it

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,240
works the parity of the increase 20.

213
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,560
and so additionally uh

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
so

215
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,520
we note that so

216
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,240
the bernstein uh number time pointed out

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
that the problems would be solved if e

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
employment chandra is quantum in

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
differentiability on

220
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
such a combination of random workers but

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
we i didn't check the details but

222
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,039
this is a promising approach to so

223
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
to fill out this question mark as by yes

224
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
mark

225
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,880
okay so because of the time limitation i

226
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
want to

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
talk about the

228
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,479
0.1 and 0.3 okay

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,679
in order to do so so i i want to label

230
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
sxy

231
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,360
so sxy

232
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,320
is a conversion from a deterministic pke

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
into the industry chem scheme

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
so

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,760
and we say that pk is strongly

236
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,519
dischargeable so if the the random

237
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
are cipher attached to random plaintext

238
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,680
this one

239
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
it's in this computationally

240
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
indistinguishable from

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
fiberglass generated by simulator

242
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
and in addition so we required that

243
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,800
a ciphertext generated by simulator is

244
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
is uh

245
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,839
really

246
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,040
lies in

247
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
a ciphertext space of this one

248
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
so

249
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
that is so we require to this

250
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,880
this for this

251
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
so by using such a deterministic pte so

252
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,839
chem stream is defined as flows

253
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,640
so

254
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
in general of chem

255
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
we first denote the encryption key and

256
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,120
the description key by using pk's gene

257
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,959
and then we additionally choose this

258
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
random sheet

259
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,480
so in encapsulation we uh

260
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
it's randomly select

261
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,760
this plaintext and it encrypts this aim

262
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
by using the ek an obtainability

263
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,000
and full session key of game scheme so

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
it computed k as this h of m

265
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,880
and then returned it returns cipher

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
diction k

267
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
so in the calculation so

268
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
receiving a ciphertext it first compute

269
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,680
the m prime as a decryption result

270
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
then so it

271
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
if the receiving ciphertext is a

272
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
re-encrypted

273
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
name ciphertextus then so

274
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
it's output k as a hash of n prime so

275
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
otherwise so it's output the random

276
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,760
pseudonym

277
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
this k

278
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
so this is a

279
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,680
sxy

280
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:45,839
so uh

281
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,279
in order to uh so the main problem of

282
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,920
to show industry security so we need to

283
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
simulate the determination work object

284
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
so in order to do so so sxy are using

285
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,399
this approach so they

286
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
define the hash of m as another hash of

287
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
q of encryption of ek and m

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
so by using this approach so we can

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,399
simulate the calculation local as a

290
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
htube ciphertext

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
and in addition so if we

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,200
replace a vr ciphertext with the

293
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
ciphertext to generate simulator

294
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
so then this

295
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,920
will be looks random uh from uh jrd

296
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,720
buffalo so by using this approach this

297
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,920
facts

298
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,880
so uh sxy proves industry security of

299
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
game scheme as follows so we want to

300
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
show that this line

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,040
is equal to this line accommodation

302
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
distinctive this line

303
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
so in order to do so we constant hybrid

304
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
games between

305
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
these three three hybrid games

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
and so we can show that

307
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
uh at first we replace the decaturation

308
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,399
rocker with h of 2

309
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
by simulating the chapters morocco then

310
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
so we can replace this side voltage with

311
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
a simulated ciphertext generated by

312
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
simulator

313
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
then so we can

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
we can show that this k drk is

315
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
indistinguishable from random k

316
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,839
then

317
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
so replacing uh

318
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,200
by using a rebut approach so we obtain

319
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
this

320
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
final line

321
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,519
so this is fat uh sx i did in uh to show

322
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,000
the industry security

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
so by using uh this approach so let us

324
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
consider fat uh graphs and malam and

325
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,720
betasandies

326
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
so uh let us consider the uh upright uh

327
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,639
grab setup approach to show that

328
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,560
and occur security on sxy

329
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
so in the case so we need to simulate

330
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,839
two decapitation capacitor

331
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,600
since we don't know uh

332
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
dk0 and dk1

333
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,959
so therefore the knew that to do so so

334
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,040
gmp i used as a

335
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,279
modifying the hash function as this this

336
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,760
one rk as this one so instead of h of m

337
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,800
so they use the h of m and c

338
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,079
and so they define the h of m c as the h

339
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,120
i of c if

340
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
in just encryption v k i and m is a

341
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
input ciphertext

342
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
and otherwise so it output h of q

343
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
hq of c

344
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
so by using this uh

345
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,360
definition so the degeneration oracle

346
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
for dk0 is assimilated by this h0 ct and

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,720
the expression molecule for dk1 is

348
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
simulated by the h-ram ct

349
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,880
oh this is a

350
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,600
grab it grab that word approach

351
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
so unfortunately there's a

352
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
problem so this this simulation require

353
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,800
a weak robot robustness so this means

354
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
that the underlying pk so with this

355
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
green pk is collision freeness so

356
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,959
therefore so we cannot apply this

357
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
approach to the class command

358
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
class communicates because classical

359
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
matrix is not collision free

360
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,959
and in addition so

361
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
to show anonymity so we need to modify

362
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,320
this h h of m instead of

363
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,519
s we need to modify h of m c instead of

364
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,959
h of m

365
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
so since m 2 uses the original x square

366
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,040
so this is

367
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,440
another obstacle to show the anonymity

368
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,040
and through

369
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
so we solve this problem by you

370
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
considering a strong pseudonymous social

371
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
strong shoulder anomalous

372
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,399
means that this cyphertext pair of

373
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
ciphertext j generated by uh

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
encapsulation is indistinguishable from

375
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,240
a

376
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
ciphertext generated by simulator and

377
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,040
that

378
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,880
chosen from random

379
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
and this uh so this is a

380
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,199
recap of

381
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,959
chemistry

382
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,680
so

383
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
in order to do

384
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
in order to show anonymity and a and

385
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,120
social security

386
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,199
so we want to show that this and this is

387
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,440
a competition industry initiative

388
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
so we consider two hybrid games

389
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
so

390
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,719
and so

391
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,720
in the uh

392
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
the first two lines uh computationally

393
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,279
distinguishable because of

394
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,839
strong shoulder around the mass on uk 0

395
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
and then so we here so we can use the

396
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,000
dk1

397
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,279
and in this line so we use dk0 but so

398
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,240
this

399
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
switch of the

400
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
the calculation key is a

401
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,399
statistically indistinguishable

402
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,639
then so we

403
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
replace this ciphertext and k uh as a

404
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,959
real one

405
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,440
generated by ek1 so this is uh

406
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
justified by the strong student

407
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,439
anonymous

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,199
so therefore so we can show that uh this

409
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,120
spr cca

410
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,279
immediately implement a n o c in the

411
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,560
chem case

412
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
so we want therefore so we want to show

413
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,480
uh

414
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,839
sxy

415
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,800
imply the sprc security

416
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,880
so in order to do so so we

417
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
we uh back to the industry security of

418
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
sxy

419
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,759
so this is a6 wise approach

420
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,279
of hybrid games

421
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,800
and also we want to show that sds

422
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
stronghold strong distance

423
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,199
simulatability impress sprc security or

424
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
became scheme so therefore we want to

425
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
show that this is

426
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
computationally indistinguishable this

427
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,800
one

428
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,279
so and then so we recall that the

429
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
industry security

430
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
hybrid games of industry security so

431
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
then we

432
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,320
obtained this one and we next game and

433
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
third game this game

434
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,839
so now uh seeing this game

435
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,600
on this game

436
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,800
so the difference is uh how to simulate

437
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
the traffic station workload so in this

438
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,160
game so we use the h2 o2 but in this

439
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
game so we are we use real decay but

440
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,199
apparently so

441
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,760
we can replace this one at this one

442
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
because we define so

443
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,400
because so this is uh

444
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
corresponding to this approach

445
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,679
so therefore

446
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,160
we just obtain this

447
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
uh sprc security uh as a industry

448
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
security of this xy

449
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
okay

450
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,799
okay let me laptop

451
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,400
so this is summary

452
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,360
so

453
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
we showed that uh

454
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,200
so in order to consider uh anonymity so

455
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
we first intermediate security notion so

456
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
strong should randomness

457
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,280
so then so we first showed the strongest

458
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,600
randomness implies anonymity

459
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,120
then so we construct the camden

460
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
framework for such sphere hybrid pks

461
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
unfortunately so on robustness so grab

462
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
sector already shows that i show such

463
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,000
hybrid candidates framework and then so

464
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,240
we use a robustness framework

465
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
then so to construct such a sprcgame

466
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,600
streams so we consider sxy and hu and h

467
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,799
u and so on

468
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,080
then so

469
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
we can show that strongly distinguished

470
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,760
metal pk implies us

471
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
sprc chem schemes

472
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
then we apply them to institutional

473
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,840
three games we then obtain these

474
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,160
tables so uh

475
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
as a open process uh we want

476
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
uh open pro we have two open problems

477
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
the one is showing the spr or

478
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,960
strong numbers or anonymity of kyber

479
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,600
without quantum indefinite stability

480
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
so this is a

481
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
open problem by uh

482
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
graph center

483
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
and then the second open problem is

484
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,559
showing a

485
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
strong shoulder randomness or anonymity

486
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,280
of

487
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,400
airflow

488
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
tightly

489
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,240
as a so because

490
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
we obtain such tight industries security

491
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,280
institute quantum molecular

492
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
any questions for the speaker

493
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,160
okay let's thank the speaker again and

494
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,880
proceed with the next talk
