1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,839
all right so our uh next talk is secure

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,400
non-interactive simulation feasibility

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
and rate uh this is by hamid raza uh

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,719
korraskani uh hamanta maji and hai and

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
gaian and hai will give the talk so

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,560
yep go ahead

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,840
hi is your microphone on

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
okay can you hear me

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,839
yeah yeah

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
okay so i'm going to talk about secure

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
non-interactive simulation visibility

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
event and this year so i work with hamid

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,840
and majin

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
so let me start with some motivation for

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
studying secure non-interactive

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
simulations

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
so a prominent

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
partner in sikki computations is a

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,280
pre-processing model

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
and this product has produced some

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
successful stories

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
in this model there are two phases

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,479
applied phase and the online phase

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,400
so obligated interviews

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
correlated private knowledge to parties

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
and this step is independent of the

27
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,400
functions and also the input of the

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
secure computation performance online

29
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
phase

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
on the other hand the online phase is

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
fast and can achieve information

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
theoretic security

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
and this phrase consumes correlations

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
generated from the object phase to

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,600
perform the

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
derived sequential tasks

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,960
okay however city um concern from

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680
for this so online protocol need very

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
well structured calculations

40
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,000
and generating

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
where structural correlations is very

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,360
expensive

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
and if so online protocol using some

44
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,000
cheap correlations like some nice

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
correlations

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,640
then

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
the online protocol is usually uh not

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
fascinating it is slow okay so one idea

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,120
the solutions is to transform

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
cheap correlations into uh

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,959
well-structured ones and

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,640
non-interactively and efficient

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
so motivated by this we introduce a new

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
model we call it cq non-interactive

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,959
simulation

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
so the objective is to similar to

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,480
simulate

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,239
a sample of um target distribution uv

59
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
from an independent sample of some sort

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
distribution x y

61
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,760
okay

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
so in this one i always get x n and v s

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
by n

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,000
additionally alice also have access to

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,879
private driving with ray

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
bob also have access to a private

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
planning ib

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
and then at least apply a reduction

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
functions on her samples and the private

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,879
randomness to obtain the output u prime

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
similarly

72
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
bob applies a reduction function gn on

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
his samples and the private bandwidth rb

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
to obtain an output v prime

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
okay

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,280
so the coordinates of the simulations it

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
will ensure that the zero distribution

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
of the output is close to the target

79
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,720
distribution

80
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,599
so in addition to the correctness uh we

81
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
also required um

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,239
security conditions okay so we followed

83
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
we formulate this security conditions uh

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,519
based on the universal composable

85
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,799
security

86
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,319
uh by k

87
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
so in this model

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,560
it is secured in corrupt analysis if the

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,519
distributions of

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
at least sample condition on fixing the

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,640
output

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,159
is rightly

93
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
independent of the top output

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
in other words

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,599
the view as a view of alice can be

96
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
simulated

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
only from

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,040
alice output

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
and similarly

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
it is secured in correct bob if the

101
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,000
distribution

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
of

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,320
both samples

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
condition on fixings outputs is rapidly

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,199
independent of

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
alice output

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
so these three conditions together if i

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
secure non-interactive simulations

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
of uv from squat

110
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,280
so to study

111
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
the rate we consider m independent

112
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,800
samples of some target distribution uv

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
so the rate of this simulation is the

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
maximum achievable rate

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,960
is a maximum achievable ratio n by n

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
so this symbol looks very similar to uh

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
some existing ones in

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
information theory and cryptography

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
okay so let me mention some of them yes

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,479
uh security non-iterative simulations

121
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,199
and information theoretic a lot of

122
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
several random communication generators

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,600
which he introduced very recently

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
and second

125
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
secure simulations their cryptographic

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
intentions of non-interactive

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
simulations

128
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
which is a classical problem in

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,199
information theory

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,320
so in

131
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
non-interactive simulations uh security

132
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,039
is not a case is not a concern at all

133
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,320
and first of all

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
secure non-interactive simulations uh

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
generalizations of non-interactive

136
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
communication institutions

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,199
to arbitrary targets

138
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,080
and finally uh one can fuse the secured

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
non-interface simulations at a rejection

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
of one way secure computations to no

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
interactions

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
so in order to computations only one

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
participates and the other party

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
measures

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,280
so i will focus on

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,000
two fundamental correlations okay so the

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
first one

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,080
is the noise from the binary symmetric

149
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
source

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,680
so for this source i'll let alice

151
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,960
receives

152
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
a uniform random bits plus one minus one

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
and here we use the multiple

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
rotations plus one means zero and minus

155
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,600
one i mean one

156
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
and we probably one minute epsilon

157
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
but we received the same bit

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
and we bought the epsilon

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
but received the philippines

160
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
so i'm representing this correlation as

161
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,800
pss rho where rho equal to 1 minus 2

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,960
epsilon

163
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
and the second

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
correlation is a noise from binary

165
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
eraser source

166
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,599
and then alice receives a uniform random

167
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
bits plus one or minus one

168
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
with probability one minus epsilon both

169
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
receives the same bit

170
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
and we brought the f61 and

171
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
probably shift the inverse fit so we use

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
rotation zero yeah for the equation

173
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
okay

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
and

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
i represent this correlations as bes rho

176
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
where rho equal to square root of one

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
minus epsilon

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,880
and the reasons um

179
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560
we choose the

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
parameter library because row

181
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,560
corresponding to the maximal

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
correlations

183
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
of

184
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,080
this source

185
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
and maximal correlations is

186
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
a very prominent quantity in information

187
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
theory and we see later that this is so

188
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,720
very convenient

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,919
for our representation

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
so let me give you an uh example of

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
institute reduction

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
so this example

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,599
in

194
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
the deductions from

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,479
uh reduction of binary symmetric source

196
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,960
from us one sample of binary eraser

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
okay so at least have an uniform running

198
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
bit x plus one or minus one

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,680
um

200
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
and bob

201
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
has y is equal to the ali speed with one

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
minus epsilon and otherwise it is zero

203
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
and so any simulation function works as

204
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
follows it says output

205
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
third random bit x

206
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
okay but output

207
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,839
y

208
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
if y is plus one or minus one

209
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,399
and otherwise if i put an uniform random

210
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
bits

211
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
and you can see that

212
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,560
this implements the output implement v

213
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
prime implements an uh bss with

214
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,920
parameter program where rob equal to

215
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
this quantity okay so it is correct and

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
one can verify that it is secure within

217
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
uh corrupt alice but

218
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
this reduction in cq again corrupt bond

219
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,120
so

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,519
the reason is that the two distribution

221
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
also two conditional distributions

222
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,160
that you can see here

223
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
is not independent

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
from u prime

225
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,600
this is at least output

226
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,680
so next um let's take a look at um

227
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
secure reduction

228
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
um

229
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
where we can simulate one sample of bss

230
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,480
from two independent samples of binary

231
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
symmetric source

232
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
with maximal correlation

233
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
okay

234
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
so so the reduction is very simple here

235
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
uh properties just output the products

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,560
of the samples okay this

237
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
u prime equal to the product of

238
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
the first sample times the second sample

239
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
and similarly for

240
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,279
okay

241
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
and for this

242
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
we can

243
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,600
verify that it corrects ncq core

244
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
subjects

245
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,959
so

246
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,920
um

247
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,440
so our questions from this model is that

248
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
given the source and distributions is

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,720
that possible to simulate the type of

250
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
distributions from the source

251
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
so in other words we are interested in

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
whether it is visible or not

253
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,200
and when it is visible

254
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
we we want to

255
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
make it very efficient

256
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,360
and we try to simulate as many

257
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,959
sample as possible

258
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,360
so we interested in what is the most

259
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
efficient secure simulations

260
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,760
so

261
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,959
we initiate the study of feasibility and

262
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
rate of secure non-interactive

263
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
simulations

264
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,800
and in an independent work agua at all

265
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
introduce the same primitive

266
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,279
and

267
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
they focus on studying the physical

268
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
feasibility

269
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
from arbitrary source and target

270
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,240
distribution

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
and you will see this in the next stop

272
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
so let me summarize

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
our results our first resource is a new

274
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
randomizations so basically

275
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
um cc does telling us that private

276
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
randomness

277
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
is iris for secure

278
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
simulation

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
and in fact we have two different ways

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
of de-randomize

281
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,959
some reduction functions the first one

282
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,079
is for the facility results

283
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,760
and the second from

284
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,279
studying the rate of secure reduction

285
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,399
so our first developmentation resources

286
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,959
tell us that if they exist um randomized

287
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,320
constructions

288
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,040
then they also exist the deterministic

289
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
constructions

290
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
that use

291
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
more

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
number of sample but asymptotically is

293
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,839
the same

294
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,440
and with the

295
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
almost identical

296
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,000
simulation error

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,240
however this simulation resource did not

298
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
suffice to study in

299
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,440
the red because it doesn't preserve the

300
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
number of samples okay it is small

301
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,600
number of sample

302
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
so we use

303
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
we also prove that it is possible to

304
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,959
de-randomize the constructions using the

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
same number of sample

306
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
but with slightly

307
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,200
higher

308
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
simulation error

309
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
so the constant here usually either half

310
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
so we can achieve square root of new if

311
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,440
the original random microconstruction

312
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
achieved

313
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,920
simulation error new

314
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
so our work focus on

315
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,800
secure simulations between biosymmetric

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,480
sources and binary eraser sources

317
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,040
so first we show that

318
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
it is impossible

319
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,480
to simulate binary israeli source from

320
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
binary symmetric source of life process

321
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
and next we consider the cell reductions

322
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,519
between binary symmetric sources

323
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
and we show that it is feasible if the

324
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
maximal correlation

325
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
of the target distributions the power of

326
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
the maximal correlations of the source

327
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,399
distribution

328
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
and in this context when this happens we

329
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,000
show that surveys is less than equal to

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,680
one by k

331
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,839
and interestingly we can prove very

332
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,279
strong

333
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,399
results

334
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,120
it tells us

335
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,519
a statistical constructions

336
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,880
can be

337
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
arrow correct

338
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
to perfect constructions

339
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,959
so in fact

340
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,320
we shall um

341
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
dichotomy

342
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
of secure simulations

343
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,519
that is

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,160
items exist a perfect construction or

345
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,639
any construction has constant insecure

346
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
and finally we

347
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,079
also consider the cell simulations

348
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,120
between

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,079
binary sources

350
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,560
this looks very similar to the

351
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
simulation of binary symmetric sources

352
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
and basically services

353
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
are similar but here

354
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
for the perfect

355
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
for the perfect constructions we are

356
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
able to solve that

357
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,359
only linear reduction function work

358
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,079
okay and for the rest of the talk i will

359
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,399
be focusing on

360
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,199
the technical ideas from our work so to

361
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,160
grow up um

362
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
let us take a look at the impossibility

363
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,279
of

364
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,839
binary resources from biology seems

365
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
resource

366
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
so first i want to note that the

367
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
impossibility result from

368
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,240
in-cq simulations and one-way sql

369
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
computation

370
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
naturally carried over to the cpu

371
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,440
simulations

372
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,600
and reverse hyper-consecutivity and have

373
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
stream and inequality as a two main

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,279
technical tool

375
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
to prove

376
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
impossibility results

377
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,360
so let me give you some intuition

378
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
how to put in possibility results here

379
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
so here if we look at the target

380
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,800
distributions

381
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,519
okay suppose that alice

382
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,279
outputs

383
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
equal to plus one with some constant

384
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
probability

385
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
and also that

386
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
box output equal to -1

387
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,519
with some constant probability

388
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
then this technical tool tells us that

389
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,079
these two events

390
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,320
must happen simultaneously

391
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
also with some constant portability

392
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,519
however for the binary eraser source

393
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
this property is zero so that's why it'd

394
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
be impossible to simulate a binary

395
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,320
eraser source from binary symmetric

396
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,320
source

397
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,959
so next

398
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,160
we

399
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,079
take a look at the impossibility of

400
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,480
binary symmetric source from binary

401
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
eraser source

402
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
so here i want to note that this problem

403
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
in the other models is an in-situ

404
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
simulations and one-way seeking

405
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,560
computations

406
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
is still open

407
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
for some reason of parameters

408
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,440
and

409
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
this problem seems

410
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,360
quite challenging in specific

411
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
however in our setting

412
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,160
with the security conditions we are able

413
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,959
to show that it is impossible

414
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
so let me give you some high-level idea

415
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
of how we prove that

416
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
so we prove it by contradictions first

417
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,720
we fix

418
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,759
some

419
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
sources and the target distributions and

420
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,240
suppose exist um

421
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,120
statistical distance as suppose existing

422
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
statistical constructions

423
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,319
so our first step we didn't we did

424
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,439
randomize

425
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,400
some

426
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
reduction functions

427
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,760
so with value of generality we can say

428
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
that the reduction function is

429
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,399
deterministic

430
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,039
and then we are surprised

431
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
the security definitions

432
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
and to our surprises we use some

433
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
macro and design macro operators of the

434
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,439
source distributions

435
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
so we can from the simulation way we can

436
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
our surprise to uh the following uh also

437
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
constraints

438
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
so i'm not going uh over the details of

439
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
these constraints

440
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,600
and from

441
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
those questions it implies an

442
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
approximate either a vector problem

443
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,919
so basically it's saying that

444
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,960
some

445
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,039
combined up to two markup operator

446
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
applied on the function f

447
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
should be close to a scaling of the

448
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,559
function f

449
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,360
so intuitively f should be an

450
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,919
approximate eigenvector of the markov

451
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,280
operator t t bar

452
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
and then interestingly we observe that

453
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,559
when we apply

454
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
the two markov operator

455
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
together

456
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,799
it is equal to the bonami maker noise

457
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,720
operator with parameter rho square

458
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
so we use um a fourier analysis

459
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,039
to show that

460
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,240
um the row grams square the power of rho

461
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,600
square

462
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
so in other words the maximum

463
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,799
combination of the target distributions

464
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
your power observe

465
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
uh must be a power of the massive

466
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
migration of the source

467
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
and furthermore we can show that

468
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,919
the spreadsheet width of the reduction

469
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,280
function f

470
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
is

471
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,600
mostly concentrated on devicators

472
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
so with the

473
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,480
concentrations

474
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,160
on low degree terms

475
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,480
we can apply a powerful tune from

476
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
harmonic analysis that is a hundred

477
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
theorem

478
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
and we can conclude that the reduction

479
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,200
function f will be close to some

480
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,320
constant junta boolean function h

481
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,280
so h here depends only on a constant

482
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
number of input variables

483
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,679
and it is independent of the number of

484
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,559
samples at

485
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
and finally

486
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,679
we use the random rejections techniques

487
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,960
to prove that

488
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,360
simulation arrows unless a constant

489
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
and here's a high-level

490
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
template

491
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,720
to

492
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
prove the

493
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
results so first we de-randomize and

494
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
then we are surprised surprises security

495
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,200
and from the other positions we get an

496
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
approximate eigenvector problem

497
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,120
and from that we show a fourier

498
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
concentrations

499
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,840
and

500
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,559
for

501
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
applying hunter theorem we can do the

502
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
dimension dimension reductions

503
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,159
and let's take a look at the feasibility

504
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,520
of a binary symmetric source from

505
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
another

506
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
binary symmetric source

507
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,640
so intuitively we follow

508
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,880
that template

509
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
we show here okay so we are able to show

510
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,840
that uh the maximum operation of the

511
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,720
target distributions must be a power of

512
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,200
the maximum condition of the source

513
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,080
okay

514
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
and

515
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
it also the case that the

516
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
sweatshirt of reduction function f

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
concentrated on

518
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,120
some dvk

519
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,799
and we also show that um

520
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,280
both reduction function energy so close

521
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
to a constant junta boolean functions

522
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600
so it depends on only constant number of

523
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,918
input variables

524
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,120
so let me give you an example

525
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
i just see

526
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,039
so as you see before

527
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,440
so linear productions

528
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
f and g here we can simulate one sample

529
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,720
of bss row prime

530
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
from two samples of bss row

531
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
and this is linear constructions

532
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
and all the fourier grades of this

533
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,080
function concentrated on degree two

534
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
because here uh your linear term is a

535
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,400
product of two variable

536
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
x1 and x2

537
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,799
but interestingly

538
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,120
for this there also exists non-linear

539
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,760
reduction functions and this is a

540
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,159
nonlinear reduction functions

541
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,320
i'm not going over the detail of these

542
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,760
constructions

543
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
but you can observe that these

544
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,120
constructions you also

545
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,440
perhaps the fourier's spectrum

546
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,840
concentrated on dv2

547
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,000
because also term here

548
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,919
has degree two

549
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,200
is the products of the two variable

550
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
and observe that this construction you

551
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,799
force samples

552
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,679
a bss rule

553
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,320
to simulate one sample here

554
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,400
so we need for example here

555
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,640
for linear reduction view only two

556
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
samples

557
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,039
so a natural question to us uh is that

558
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,799
anonymous rejection function always

559
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,799
worse than the linear reductions

560
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,360
and interestingly

561
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,280
if we look at

562
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
some simulation of two independent

563
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
samples of bss program

564
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,679
then in fact using two different

565
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,400
nonlinear reduction functions

566
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
this one and this one

567
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,960
then we can also achieve

568
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,520
we can simulate two independent samples

569
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
of binary symmetric source

570
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,600
so

571
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
um at a summary here um

572
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,640
the block linear reductions achieve the

573
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
rate half but non-linear reduction was

574
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
so achieved so they have

575
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,280
so

576
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,799
um

577
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,960
here it is natural to ask

578
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,840
another question can only can non-linear

579
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,918
reduction supply rate half

580
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,600
so

581
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,240
in fact we proved that for perfect

582
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,559
constructions

583
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,080
the rate can be at most half

584
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,559
so this means that um nonlinear

585
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,200
reduction functions can be at most edges

586
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,559
at

587
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,600
the

588
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
linear reduction functions for the

589
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
simulation of minus the symmetric source

590
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
okay so i i went over the detail of the

591
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
outline yeah

592
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,799
but for the statistics flow

593
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
for the statistical simulations this

594
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,640
problem remain open

595
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
and we conceptually

596
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
we have the following conjecture it

597
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,840
related to harmonic analysis

598
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
and here i want to emphasize that if we

599
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,360
can prove this contextual then it's sure

600
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,880
it shall prove

601
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,240
the rate from a statistical secure

602
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,320
simulation of bss from bss

603
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
so let me quickly um

604
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
go over the cross section here

605
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
so we

606
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,640
so we want to say that if we have to

607
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
aggregate three functions

608
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,440
that are all homozygous

609
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,559
and

610
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,360
any pairwise sum it also homozygous

611
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,279
boolean functions

612
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,400
then it must be say that their products

613
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,880
is also homozygous

614
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,440
so if we can put this we can put a local

615
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,120
to global structure

616
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
and

617
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
this will help us to put the red results

618
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
for statistical gains

619
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
and finally we also

620
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,440
found an interesting connection between

621
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,559
um

622
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,880
secure simulations and distant invariant

623
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,799
codes

624
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,320
so of course c

625
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,559
are a distant invariant if the number of

626
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,320
good gurus

627
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
as written i

628
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,720
from

629
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
a fixed code with c it is independent

630
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
of circle with c

631
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,120
okay so intuitively if you look at the

632
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,320
weight denominator of c

633
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,799
plus with any good word in c it is the

634
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,480
same

635
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,200
so

636
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
um

637
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,039
we show this connection to

638
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
um so secure simulations of

639
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,919
binary symmetry source okay so we saw

640
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,000
that if they secure a simulations

641
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,919
of bss

642
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:52,799
from

643
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,600
another bss

644
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,279
even if

645
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,880
the two reduction functions are

646
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,559
identical

647
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,360
and the distance enumerators

648
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,880
of any good work but in the p image of

649
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
the reduction function f

650
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
identical

651
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
okay

652
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
so at a summaries

653
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
we introduced

654
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,760
a new model a secure non-interactive

655
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,240
simulations and we initiate

656
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,520
the study of feasibility and rate of

657
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,720
this model

658
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
and we give a complete characterization

659
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,159
of physically and rates among

660
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,720
binary symmetric sources and

661
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
binary erasers sources

662
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,799
except for the statistical rate of

663
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,440
biology symmetric sources

664
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,080
and we prove very strong forms of

665
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
statistical to perfect reductions

666
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,520
and finally we saw the connections of

667
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,159
secure simulations among uh many

668
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,559
symmetric samples with homozygous

669
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,279
boolean functions and recent invalid

670
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,400
codes

671
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
and thank you for the attention

672
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,039
all right uh thanks hi um so we're

673
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,960
running a little bit uh over time so i

674
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
think uh um maybe if anyone has

675
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
questions uh i'd encourage you to

676
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,520
sign on to zoom and uh ask uh ask kai in

677
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,720
chat

678
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,600
and

679
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,760
we'll set up for the next speaker

680
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,840
thank you thanks
