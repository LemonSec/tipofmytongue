1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,279
so the next talk of this session is

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,200
practical post-quantum signature schemes

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
from isomorphism problems of trilinear

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,639
forms

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,280
the talk will be given remotely by

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
gangtong and i will

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
allow him to introduce his co-authors so

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
gung-tang please go ahead

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,599
okay and thank you for the introduction

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,400
so

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
this is the joining work with

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,600
don fong dong antoine jokes and thomas

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
planta you mean child and winnie socielo

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,079
so i'm going to talk about practical

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
post quantum signature scheme from

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
isomorphic problems of trine linear

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,879
forms

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
okay so first let me give some

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
preliminary

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
also isomorphism programs and gm

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
plus fs framework

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,840
um

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,800
so

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,159
the classical graph as a motion problem

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,439
asks

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,479
whether two graphs are the same up to

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,280
reliable in the vertices

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,119
so look at these two graphs

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
we

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
given to graph g and h

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
consists of a

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
vertex set and edge set where vertex set

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
and just below a set from 1 to n

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
and so we say that these two graph g and

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,079
h are isomorphic

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,560
if and only if we have a random

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,159
computation

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,920
belongs to asset

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
mapped to

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,040
n to n such that we have sigma take

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,119
this uh

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,200
h h set as

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
x sub e is equal to f

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
so this formula just means that for any

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,960
edge

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,479
i consist of i j belongs to e if and

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
only if we have

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,240
sigma i sigma j is belong to f

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,439
okay

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,520
so

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
there's some preliminary about tensors

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
so tensors are multi-way

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
arrays

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
you can image if we have dimension two

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
the matrices are two-way arrays

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040
so in this talk

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,160
we just focus on three way arrays always

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
so called three tensors

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
uh specifically

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,720
we define

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,879
three tensors is equal to a i k

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,720
for each one

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
aigk just below the

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,080
entry

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,560
belongs to field f

66
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
and the ijk

67
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,319
for the index ijk belongs to m

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
so what's the

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,599
term size of motion problem

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,480
so

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
uh

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
like graph isomorphism we also have a

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,720
input for list two

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
tensors a and b

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
is the size of m cos cos n

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
the question is to find an

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
invertible matrices

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
lrt such that

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
we have l act on

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
this direction

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
the first direction and the invertible

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
matrix are

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,360
act on the second direction

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
and

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
the last one back down the third

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
direction

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,159
so

88
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,040
fellow from this uh

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
this three direction action so we get

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
another

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,239
tensor b

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
so it is transaction of the problem

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,239
okay

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,920
so

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
um from this

96
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,879
isomorphism problems we

97
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,879
can design a digital signature based on

98
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
these problems

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,958
and

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
it is studied in multivariate

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,959
cryptography and isogenic cryptography

102
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,040
the

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519
construction is kind here we have two

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
steps here the first one

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,600
we just

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
construct a

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
identification scheme based on gold

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
ratch nikoli

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
zero knowledge protocol for graphite

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,320
some of them

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,919
and then

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
um we just use fair sharpening

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,400
transformation to turn this

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
identification scheme to a second

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,199
digital signature

116
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,680
okay so let's look at the step one how

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,280
to construct an

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
identification scheme a zerologi

119
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
uh

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
interactive protocol for graph

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
isomorphism

122
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
uh just include two players

123
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
uh we called prover and verifier

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,199
and they are given two graphs g and h

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,919
if g and h are isomorphic the only

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,039
support loads and has a motion

127
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,440
under the goals for the prover

128
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
she will demonstrate that she lost the

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
isomorphism without revealing it to

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,080
verify

131
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
and the goals for verify

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,639
to

133
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
guarantee

134
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
it it must

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
satisfy these two properties

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
we called companies and the sun is

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
completely it is if g and h are

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,039
isomorphic

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,919
and the prover lost the isomorphism he

140
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,520
always accepts

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
and the sound is says

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
if g and h are not isomorphic or prover

143
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
does not load some of them he rejects

144
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,639
with non-negligible probability

145
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,240
okay so

146
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,280
let's look at what's the gmw0 knowledge

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
protocol for graphism of them

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
first

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,919
given two graphs g and h as our public

150
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,960
key

151
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,800
and let sigma be an isomorphism as c p

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
such that sigma sends g to h

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
so that we have

154
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
sigma of g is equal to h and then alice

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
generates a random permutation

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
pi

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
which sends g to k

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,960
so we have the below interactive process

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,120
l alice first sends

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
k to bob and above a random sample a b

161
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
from 0 1

162
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,800
and return to alice

163
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
when alice receives b

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,120
if b is equal to 0 l is just since

165
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,840
i is equal to pi to bob otherwise since

166
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,400
i is equal to pi times sigma inverse

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
and when bob received

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,440
the response r

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,039
bob will check

170
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
if b is equal to zero bob checks whether

171
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,880
r

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,880
of g is equal to k otherwise just checks

173
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,560
out h is equal to k

174
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,160
okay so that's the construction of your

175
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
gmw vertical

176
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,919
uh as our identification scheme then we

177
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,479
just apply field xiaomi transformation

178
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,919
to get a digital signature

179
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
uh first xiaomi proposed a muscle let's

180
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,639
take an identification scheme and turns

181
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,440
it to a digital signature the key idea

182
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
is use a hash function

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
to simulate the interaction process

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,039
the

185
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,879
identification scheme based on

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,080
isomorphism problem fits this method

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
also

188
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,879
the field xiaomi transformation

189
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,319
the security of their xiaomi

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
transformation just

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
proved in the random oracle model

192
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
and very recently is also proved in the

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
quantum around locomotor

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,800
so generally an isomorphism testing

195
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
problem asked whether two

196
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,400
uh combinatorial or algebraic objects

197
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
are essentially the same besides graphs

198
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,479
as a mobilism testing problem for groups

199
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,759
h graphs

200
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
lattices and linear codes has

201
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,279
have also been studied

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,360
but uh

203
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
graphics is not good because graphite so

204
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,640
it's low and very easy problem both in

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,399
theory

206
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,360
and in practice

207
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
so naturally we have a question

208
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
can we rescue this framework

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
the gmw plus field xiaomi to other

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,079
isomorphic problems

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,120
uh in 1996 pattern suggested to replace

212
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,760
graph isomorphism with polynomial sum of

213
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,640
them

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,040
in particular he suggested the digital

215
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
signature scheme as we described

216
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
so polynomial some of them is a family

217
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,399
of problems

218
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,120
so it just depends on the polynomial

219
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,240
degrees the number of polynomials and so

220
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
on so something from this family such as

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
as a molecule of quadratic

222
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
polynomials with one secret

223
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
uh

224
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,959
is so called ip1s

225
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
turns out to be easy

226
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
and also it gives a rise to a series of

227
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,120
works in multivariate cryptography

228
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
also

229
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,839
in exogeny-based

230
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
cryptography kuvinis first proposed the

231
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
use of class group actions are inept

232
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
curves in cryptography

233
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,880
they adapt to the gmw identification

234
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
protocol to

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,760
this action and uh

236
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
stone bolov suggested to apply

237
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
the first xiaomi transformation to this

238
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,839
identification problem

239
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,480
protocol to get a signature scheme

240
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
however

241
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
the use of ordinary inhibit curves has

242
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
issues including the sub-exponential

243
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,640
time quantum

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
algorithm

245
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
and slow performance

246
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,680
so this leads to some serious work snack

247
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,880
so the attention that turns turn to

248
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,640
super singular elliptic curves

249
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
is so called

250
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
site or say site

251
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
this leads to some also lead to some

252
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,120
progress on signature game recently

253
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,279
okay

254
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,320
so let's look at the turn size of them

255
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
in the post quantum cryptography

256
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
in post-quantum cryptography we wish to

257
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
devise

258
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,839
cryptographic

259
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,560
protocols that are hopeful to resist

260
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,839
attacks by

261
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,160
computers this requires to utilize

262
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,000
limitations of quantum mechanism

263
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,760
and a later

264
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
development of short algorithm for

265
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,880
integer factorization and the discrete

266
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,519
log is the hidden subgroup program

267
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,880
framework

268
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
so one key reason for utilizing

269
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
nitrous problem in post cryptography

270
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
lies in the connection with the dihedral

271
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
hidden sub

272
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
so the best algorithm for

273
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
the hedo hidden sub

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,279
group program is just a sub exponential

275
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,880
uh proposed by cooperberg so similarly a

276
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,079
key reason for euthanizing

277
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
tensile muscle mass in the connection

278
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,279
with the

279
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
hidden sub

280
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
problem for general linear groups

281
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,800
so

282
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,920
for which

283
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
there is this strong negative evidence

284
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,639
for the current techniques to work

285
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,399
and also there's some consequence of the

286
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
strongest such insights we have about

287
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,639
nymphs of quantum mechanisms

288
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
okay so

289
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
here's some

290
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,519
comparison of the best algorithm for

291
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,160
graph iso on the tensor iso

292
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,959
so the for the graphics so we have a

293
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
boot fourth algorithm running in time n

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
factorial

295
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
times the polygon

296
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
in worst case

297
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
um we have a constant polynomial time

298
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,079
proposed by by and in average case

299
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,040
it will be solved in linear time

300
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,839
and in practice

301
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,440
uh if we should earn is more than it is

302
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,320
larger than 10 to the 6

303
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
is uh it is very easy to solve

304
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,880
however if we focus on the tens

305
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
isomorphism input first way

306
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
just running time q to the n square

307
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,040
and times value of n log n unknown q

308
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,839
in worst case

309
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,920
we have algorithm running time of q to

310
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
the one half times n squared plus a

311
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
constant

312
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,880
in average case we have a q20 algorithm

313
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,839
uh also in practice if we choose n is

314
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
equal to 10 q is 11

315
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,920
so the evidence

316
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
shows us it's hard to

317
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
solve

318
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,399
okay

319
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,920
so

320
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,040
here's some criteria for constructing a

321
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
secure protocol

322
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,480
so first why is practical complexity and

323
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
theoretical complexity and where study

324
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
so the transaction of them just satisfy

325
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
all the above based on current

326
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
evidence

327
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,639
so ji and chan young in pcc lighting it

328
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,199
may propose to use transaction mobile as

329
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,800
the security bases for the gmw plus fs

330
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,399
framework

331
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,760
uh just based on advances on complexity

332
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
and algorithms

333
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,839
in the complexity

334
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,399
side butcher and child propose a complex

335
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,600
class

336
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
so-called tensorfest muslim in the

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
algorithm set based on many works in

338
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,399
multivariate cryptography and some of

339
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,720
another

340
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,320
works okay so lately we have a question

341
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
can we make

342
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,880
gmw plus fs plus turns as much

343
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
impractical

344
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
so as i

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
described the above

346
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,680
go to

347
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,959
define a new complex d-class ti complete

348
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,800
consisting of problems that are

349
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
polynomial time equivalent to tensile

350
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
motion

351
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,240
next we have gi complete uh

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
just consists of problem that are

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
polynomial equivalent to graphing some

354
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,639
of them

355
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
okay so let's introduce a new concept we

356
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
call alternating tri-linear form

357
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,959
so first we let gl and fq be the general

358
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,399
linear group consisting of unbanned

359
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,519
uh

360
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,000
invertible matrices of fq

361
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,959
and the phase is said to be trinial if

362
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,759
are linear in all the three arguments we

363
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
say that a training from phi from f q to

364
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,519
the n cross f cubed and cross f to the n

365
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,800
to f cube

366
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,240
is alternating if whatever two

367
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,360
arguments of three are equal and three

368
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
will evaluate to zero

369
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,079
a later group action of

370
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,040
uh a belongs to gl and fq and the

371
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
alternating trend uniform

372
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,639
three just sends free uvw to feed actor

373
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,360
a

374
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,199
and

375
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,160
it just means a phase transpose act on

376
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,639
each agreement

377
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,079
so

378
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
let's give a definition of alternative

379
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,639
trending from equivalence

380
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
like tens isomorphism

381
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
are given two alternating trends uniform

382
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
pha and positive

383
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,480
whether there exists a

384
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,079
inverting matrix

385
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,759
a such that we have a just a sense

386
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,600
uh precise to three

387
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,199
so and computes one such a if it

388
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
exists

389
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,240
and also we have a theorem

390
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
it just says alternating trend linear

391
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,720
form equivalence problem is in ti

392
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,959
complete

393
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,560
specifically that is atfe and

394
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
ti of polytime

395
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
uh equivalence

396
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,400
so here's some motivations from

397
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,000
cryptography

398
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,039
um because of you've if we want

399
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
to implement

400
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,559
this scheme

401
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
we will generate the tensor will

402
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,599
generate the alternating trend uniform

403
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,400
but if we generate a tensor it will cost

404
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,880
n cube

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
but for the

406
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,840
alternating chain uniform we just

407
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
cost into three for example if we choose

408
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
n is equal to line

409
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,360
n cube is uh equal to

410
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,240
729 but then true so is just 84.

411
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
so this is the big save in practice

412
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
and also we have a practical algorithm

413
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
for atfe

414
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
uh is running time q to the two

415
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,919
uh two thirds

416
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,640
and

417
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,440
uh times polynomials and no noq

418
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
so also we just we also analyzed some

419
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
attacks based on global basis

420
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,080
so we have

421
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,039
experimental results on maple and magma

422
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,000
and it shows that if we choose n is

423
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
smaller than six it will be very fast

424
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,559
and a is equal to

425
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,600
six and the q is five

426
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,640
uh it will run in about

427
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,039
700 seconds

428
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,280
and n is equal to 7

429
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
it cannot achieve

430
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
also we give a improved experimental

431
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,760
results we just add some add more

432
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,280
equations and guess some entries

433
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
um

434
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,280
so

435
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,000
this these equations will be redundant

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
for us but it uh

437
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,559
seems helpful for google basics

438
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,080
and this result shows uh if n is smaller

439
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
than 8 it will be very fast and it will

440
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
permit

441
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,679
breaking n is equal to 10 but n is equal

442
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,039
to 9 it

443
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,880
also cannot achieve

444
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,520
so it is reasonable to choose any is

445
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
larger or equal to line

446
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,559
okay

447
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,200
so that's some parameter choice of our

448
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
scheme and lamina below the security

449
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
parameter r delos the number of wrong

450
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
and the tutorial say just loads the

451
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,919
number of alternating trinity from

452
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,799
generated in each round and we have some

453
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
estimations about

454
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,200
like r times say

455
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
is larger

456
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,360
or equal to lambda and we also have the

457
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
formula of our public key size private

458
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
key size and signature size and with

459
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,200
these estimations and based on the

460
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,440
global basis attack

461
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
but we can choose

462
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
the reasonable r and say to balance our

463
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
parameters like

464
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
public key and price private key and

465
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,120
significant key sites

466
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
also we have a implementation for our

467
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,000
scheme

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
and when we we have four concrete

469
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,760
schemes one two three four and we choose

470
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,520
the reasonable parameter qmrc

471
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,360
uh

472
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
and

473
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
we calculate the public key private key

474
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
and the signature size

475
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
also

476
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
for the implementation we have the

477
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
running time of key generation

478
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,159
signed and verified

479
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
sorry

480
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,480
okay let's give a summary on next graph

481
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,679
iso

482
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,400
atfe seems to be a much harder problem

483
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,039
both in syria and in practice and the

484
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,400
hardness of

485
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
alternating trend uniform equivalence

486
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,480
can be explored to device

487
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,320
cryptographic protocols essentially in

488
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,039
night of post quantum cryptography

489
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
and we propose a practical signature

490
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,960
system based on this problem

491
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,520
and we also analyze attacks on the

492
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
global basis

493
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,120
and the

494
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
fellow will shoot the reasonable

495
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,400
parameters very carefully to balance and

496
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,520
implement this scheme

497
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,080
thank you very much

498
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,919
thank you

499
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,080
are there any questions

500
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
if so please uh go to the mic yes

501
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,000
so there's a question incoming

502
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
hi uh thank you for a great talk

503
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
so i was wondering what's the motivation

504
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
to go to dimension three uh what does

505
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,320
this have that dimension two doesn't

506
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,280
have and

507
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,039
what about dimension four is that then

508
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
even better

509
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,039
so

510
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,200
which one dimension

511
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,600
you mean for operating from uniform yeah

512
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,480
so the motivation from the

513
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
practice here

514
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
motivation because if we use the 10 size

515
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,679
motion it will cost

516
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,280
it will be

517
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
expensive because

518
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,400
if we store a sentence it will cost a

519
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,799
few but if we just

520
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,799
store a alternating trending from it

521
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,360
will be untruthfully

522
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,480
i i guess i was maybe i'm a little bit

523
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
confused but uh if we go all the way

524
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
back to the beginning we're talking

525
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
about uh matrices of dimension three or

526
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
tensor products after i mentioned three

527
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
where normally like i'm used to matrices

528
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,720
of dimension two where you can only

529
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
multiply on both on two sides and you're

530
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
using matrices of dimension three and i

531
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,919
was just curious about um

532
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,000
does that make sense

533
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,960
yeah

534
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320
yeah

535
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,679
and i was wondering like what's what's

536
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,200
the motivation to go to dimension three

537
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,400
in distance of dimension three

538
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,919
what's the motivation go dimension three

539
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,799
yeah

540
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
because uh if you

541
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,840
if you just focus on this two dimension

542
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,480
it will be easy because if you

543
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,360
uh

544
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,480
just

545
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
make this uh

546
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,760
the second

547
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,840
dimension for

548
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
another side it will be to solve a

549
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
linear polynomial

550
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
the problem the problem will be to solve

551
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,279
for

552
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,240
equations of linear equations

553
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
ah

554
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,840
okay thank

555
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,240
you okay there is still time for another

556
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
question

557
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,159
so i have a quick question so your four

558
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,440
schemes

559
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,000
uh parameter sets do they

560
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,520
have they been set to to match the aes

561
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,840
oh sorry the nist uh post quantum levels

562
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
yeah yes uh

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,120
this parameter just matched the

564
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,840
parameter uh security parameter for 128.

565
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,039
okay

566
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
thank you

567
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,159
there's no

568
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,919
other questions let's thank the speaker

569
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,240
again

570
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,559
thank you
