1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,120
okay

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,200
so

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,400
now it's time for the third and final

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
talk of the session which is

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,239
going through the anonymous robust

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,039
post-quantum public key encryption by

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,920
varun maram and varun is here so

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,960
i will

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
let him introduce his co-author and

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,560
welcome him to the stage so please go

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,930
ahead

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,090
[Applause]

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
uh thank you my time and uh i would like

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
to thank everyone present here um

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,960
because

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
um i know that it can be a bit of a pain

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
to attend these morning sessions during

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,079
a conference so i hope to make this less

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,760
boring for you guys

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,600
um so here i'm going to talk about um

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
anonymous and robust public key

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
encryption schemes in a post-quantum

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
setting so in my talk i'll be giving an

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
overview of some of our main results and

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,960
this is based on a joint work with uh

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,040
paul grubs from university of michigan

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,799
and my phd advisor kenny

28
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,880
patterson um

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
oops

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,240
oops yeah

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
so yeah so uh the main setting of our

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,640
work uh is related to ernest's ongoing

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
postcode cryptography standardization

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,040
process where we have um

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
uh the four uh finalists and five

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,280
alternate candidates that are currently

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,439
being considered for standardization in

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,119
uh the public key encryption category

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
and

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
and the main criteria of evaluation for

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
these schemes was on uh how well these

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
schemes achieve the so-called ncca

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
notion of security

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,280
and rightfully so because ncca security

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
is usually considered to be like a gold

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,520
standard because it suffices for most

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
cryptographic applications

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,040
but in this work we were mainly

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
interested in evaluating the relative

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
fitness of these candidates in other

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
important applications that require

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
security properties beyond in cca

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
so one such property that we considered

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,879
was uh so-called anonymity or ano cca

55
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
security to be more formal so anonymity

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,640
roughly guarantees that the cipher text

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
does not leak the public key which was

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,000
used to encrypt the corresponding

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,239
message so for example in the setting

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
with alice so if alice wants to send a

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
message m uh to bob and she wants to

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
hide the fact that she's communicating

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
with bob from other third parties like

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
eve then what she does is that she

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
encrypts the message under verbs for the

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
key and then somehow broadcasts the

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
ciphertext to a subset of user uh

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
including bob such that the resulting

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,800
cipher text

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
eve cannot be able to figure out who was

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
the intended receiver of alice's message

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
that is

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
you should not be able to figure out

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
which public key was used

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,760
and anonymity uh was formalized by

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
belarus

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
in 2001 and it was shown to be

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
like it's pretty much considered to be

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
like a standard security notion at this

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,840
point

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
and uh it has uh it's also an important

82
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,080
component in different modern

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
applications such as uh private

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,760
cryptocurrencies like zcash uh

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,040
but maybe on hindsight i should have

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
removed this from my slide um after

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
listening to the community's thoughts on

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
cryptocurrencies from the rim session

89
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
but it has other important applications

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
such as in digital auctions anonymous

91
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,560
credentials and other

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
applications if your application

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
requires anonymity in some form then

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
chances are you would require a pk

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
scheme which satisfies this notion of

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
anonymity

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
now let's come back to the same example

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,680
now because of anonymity even uh the

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
users carol and dave should not be able

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
to tell who was the intended receiver of

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,519
alice's message

102
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
so the naive thing that all of these

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
users would do is that they just tried

104
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
to decrypt the

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,560
uh receive ciphertext using their

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
respective secret keys so for example in

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
this setting if uh dave upon obtaining

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
the ciphertext c from alice

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
if he decrypts the ciphertext using his

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,760
own secret key and requires some valid

111
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,439
message m double prime

112
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
then he might mistakenly think that

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
alice wanted to send the message m

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
double prime to him which is not the

115
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,160
case

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
so to prevent such ambiguity we

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
additionally require another

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
complementary security property known as

119
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
robustness or s-rob cca to be more

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
formal

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
so strong robustness guarantees that

122
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
it's hard to come up with the cipher

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
text such that it decrypts validly under

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
two different secret keys

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
so in this setting if carol and dave try

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
to decrypt such a cipher text then they

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
should get back an error which

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,080
implicitly means that the message is not

129
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,880
intended to them

130
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,120
again robustness was formalized by abdar

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
etal in a public key setting uh in 2010

132
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,759
and

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,919
it's also an important security property

134
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,000
in its own right uh for example in

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
searchable encryption schemes and other

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,199
important applications

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,479
all right so now let's come back to

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
earnest candidates

139
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,919
so all of these candidates they

140
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
construct their ncc secured pke schemes

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
by first constructing an ncc secure cam

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
and then they compose these

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
these cams in a standard way with a

144
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
one-time authenticated encryption scheme

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
to obtain the final pke

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
here i'm assuming familiarity with chems

147
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
and their security properties

148
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,160
um

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
and yes so uh just uh to

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
put things in a brief way uh so if alice

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
wants to send a message to bob then what

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
she does is first she runs this

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,479
asymmetric chem component uh to generate

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
this key k

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
using bob's public key and then this key

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,639
is actually used to encrypt the message

157
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
using the symmetric demo component and

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
in this const uh context such pk schemes

159
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,319
are known as hybrid pk schemes

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
right

161
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
and it's it's pretty well known that if

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,680
you have an ncc secure cam you compose

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
them with an authenticated encryption

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,240
scheme and then you get an ncc secure pk

165
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,000
scheme thanks to uh kramer and shoop

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
but now what if in addition to ncc

167
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,720
security i want my hybrid pk scheme to

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,199
satisfy anonymity

169
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
attention this talk will be

170
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
focusing only on anonymity and not

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,680
probationaries because of time

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
restrictions

173
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,199
so

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
yeah and just to put put things in an

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,039
informal way so roughly speaking by

176
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
anonymity i mean that encryption of a

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
message m under bob's public key should

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
be somehow indistinguishable from the

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
encryption of the same message under a

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
different public key say dave's public

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
key

182
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,639
so one of our main results in this work

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
was to show what additional properties

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
we require of our chem

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,960
to ensure that the final pk scheme is

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,639
satisfies anonymity

187
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,319
so we showed that uh if our chem if it's

188
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
in cc secure as before

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
but if it also satisfies a notion of

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,880
anonymity where here

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
i mean that the encapsulation under

192
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
bob's public key should be

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,800
indistinguishable from the encapsulation

194
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
under a different public key

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
and if the kim also satisfies a notion

196
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
of free robustness that is if you

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
encapsulate under bob's public key but

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
then you decapsulate using a different

199
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,319
secret key you get back an error so if

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,160
our chem satisfies these two additional

201
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,919
security properties

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,759
then if our dem is again a standard

203
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,599
authenticated encryption scheme then the

204
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
final pk scheme that does satisfy

205
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
anonymity this was one of our main

206
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,599
results uh and we would like to point

207
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,280
out that this uh our reset is a

208
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
generalization of muharra syriza back in

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
2010 because he considered

210
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
specific camps which are constructed

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
directly from pk schemes so i start with

212
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
the pk scheme and to

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
construct my chem i just encrypt a

214
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,520
random message from the message space

215
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
and that will be my chem

216
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,840
but here we consider a general

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
class of camps because we know that nest

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
camps are not constructed in this way

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
that mohassal considered so technically

220
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,479
speaking mohassel's result does not

221
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
really apply to the initial candidates

222
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
so now let's try to zoom in on this weak

223
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
row business requirement that we require

224
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,039
of over chem

225
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
in our work we also show that not only

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
is this weak robustness requirement

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,599
sufficient but it so it's also somehow

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,800
necessary

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,479
because we can't we constructed an

230
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
artificial example of a chem which

231
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,200
satisfies ncc security anonymity but not

232
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
weak robustness such that if you compose

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
it with a dem which is a one-time

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
authenticated encryption scheme then the

235
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,760
resulting pk scheme does not satisfy

236
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
anonymity

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
and the counter example holds no matter

238
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
how clever how strong you make your damn

239
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
so this shows that somehow your weak row

240
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,959
business is necessary and sufficient

241
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,959
and now uh

242
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,320
then recall that we grow business

243
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
requires that you encapsulate under

244
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
bob's public key but decaps it under a

245
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
different secret key you should get back

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,000
an error so implicitly this means that

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
if a chem is robust then the

248
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,279
decapsolation algorithm should be

249
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,560
capable of returning an error symbol

250
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
unfortunately

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
more

252
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
like all of the niche candidates except

253
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
hqc are so called implicit rejection

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
chems by implicit rejection i mean that

255
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
the capsulation algorithm never returns

256
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,279
an error symbol it always spits out some

257
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
bit string but never error

258
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
so hence uh yeah our camden composition

259
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
result looks cool nice and all but

260
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
if you want to apply this to the nist

261
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
cams it does not apply

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,000
so hence to somehow salvage this we have

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
we took a closer look of how these

264
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
implicit rejection camps are constructed

265
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
in the first place by these nest

266
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,839
candidates

267
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
so these these candidates they

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
constructed ncc secured chems via a

269
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,279
generic

270
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,800
technique known as the fujisaki or

271
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
commodore transformation

272
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,560
so what they do is they first construct

273
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
a weakly secure base pk scheme which

274
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
satisfies one witness against cpa

275
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,079
attacks

276
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,839
and then they compose a pk scheme with a

277
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,279
couple of hash functions in a very

278
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,920
clever way such that the resulting chem

279
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
is in cc secure

280
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
but for this weak security to strong

281
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
security transformation to work we

282
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
additionally need to assume that our

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,279
hash functions behave as so-called

284
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,200
quantum random oracles

285
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
that is uh we should be able to query

286
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,640
these quantum random oracles on a

287
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
superposition of inputs and get back a

288
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,560
superposition of random outputs

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
and now let's uh

290
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
let's focus on the nist finalists for

291
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,120
the moment these furnished finalists now

292
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,760
each of these finalists use a variants

293
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
of these uh this generic fo

294
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,000
transformation to construct their chems

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
so more specifically the first three

296
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,920
candidates classic mercury skywar and

297
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
saber they use variants of this effort

298
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
transformation in the literature

299
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
it's called fo superscript notebot uh

300
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
i'll just call it f4 um

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
in this presentation

302
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,399
uh you don't have to look at how this

303
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,600
scheme works we'll come back to this

304
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
later but these three schemes use a

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
variance of this standard for

306
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,279
transformation in the literature to

307
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
construct their chems

308
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
also another alternate candidate for

309
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
chem also uses a variant of this

310
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
specific fo transformation so in our

311
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
work we focused on these three nest

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,360
finalists and this alternate candidate

313
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
and now it was shown by jiang ital

314
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,279
in 2018 that the standard fo

315
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,000
transformation does result in ncc secure

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
camps in the quantum random oracle model

317
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
and in in our work we showed that if the

318
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,720
base pk scheme satisfies some additional

319
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,440
mild security properties namely that of

320
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
weak anonymity and some kind of weak

321
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,959
robustness then the resulting chem also

322
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,199
is anonymous

323
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
so uh i won't be going to details what

324
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
these properties exactly are but for the

325
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,519
purpose of this presentation you can

326
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,920
think of them as some cpa style weak

327
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
properties but then in the end you get

328
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
some strong anonymity guarantees

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
towards this result at least on a high

330
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,399
level we extended jian guitar's proof

331
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
techniques in a single keeper setting in

332
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,800
the context of ncc security

333
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
and we extended to a two key page

334
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,279
setting in the context of uh anonymity

335
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,720
because if you recall in the ncc

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,959
security game the challenger samples a

337
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,519
single key pair but in the anonymity

338
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,839
setting the challenger generates two

339
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
keepers i mean this change looks small

340
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
but in the context of

341
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
performing security analysis in this two

342
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,240
keypad setting it creates some

343
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,120
additional headaches

344
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
okay so now let's zoom out and again

345
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,240
let's come back to our camden

346
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
composition result which unfortunately

347
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,920
does not apply to these scams because of

348
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,160
this weak row business requirement

349
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,200
and one good news is that in our work we

350
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
showed that for uh we can overcome this

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
generic impossibility result by focusing

352
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
on a specific class of camps which are

353
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
obtained by this standard f1 orbital

354
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,360
transformation

355
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,079
so

356
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
we showed that you can somehow replace

357
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
the weak robustness requirement

358
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
with the gamma spreadness requirement of

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
your base pk scheme

360
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,519
now for for those of you who don't know

361
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
so gamma speedness means that if you

362
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,560
have a randomized base pk scheme so for

363
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
any message and for any fixed message

364
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
and for any fixed public key if you

365
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,880
encrypt the message then the ciphertext

366
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
distribution should have sufficiently

367
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,639
large entropy

368
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
and gamma sweetness is a very standard

369
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
uh property in

370
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,760
uh in current uh in the pk schemes for

371
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
example

372
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
so yeah so now we have a good news so we

373
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
have at least now some hope of obtaining

374
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
uh anonymous pk schemes when we have our

375
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,240
starting camp to be a nist chem which is

376
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
implicitly rejecting

377
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,279
so now then we in our work we wanted to

378
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
apply we want to do a case study of

379
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
these four uh schemes so first we

380
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
focused on classic mechanism

381
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
unfortunately

382
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
the base peaky scheme used by classic

383
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
michaelis is a deterministic scheme

384
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,839
so by definition it does not satisfy the

385
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,839
notion of gamma spreadness

386
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,760
so again we are in an unfortunate

387
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
scenario where again the result looks

388
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,760
cool but it does not apply to the

389
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
concrete scheme of classic michaelis

390
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
but now let's focus on uh robustness so

391
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,360
what can you say attest robustness of

392
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
classic michele speaking scheme

393
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
because i did mention in the earlier on

394
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
in my talk that

395
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
robustness is an important security

396
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,160
property in its own right

397
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
now i won't be going into the lower

398
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
level details but we showed that because

399
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
of the way the base pk scheme of classic

400
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
michael is defined we can export some of

401
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,399
its properties to show

402
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,639
that for any message m that alice wants

403
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
to send to bob using classic mickele's

404
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,279
we can construct a hybrid cipher text c

405
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,120
such that if we try to decrypt the same

406
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,760
cipher text not only using bob's secret

407
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
key but any secret key in the classic

408
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,519
mercury system

409
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,920
not only do we get a valid message but

410
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
we get back the same message m that

411
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
alice wanted to send to bob

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
so this is a peculiar property but it is

413
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,160
sufficient to break the formal notion of

414
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
strong robustness for classic micheles

415
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
and this result holds no matter how

416
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
clever how strong you make your damn

417
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
yeah

418
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
but in subsequent work two hours so

419
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
kusagawa was able to show that classic

420
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,199
weekly speaking scheme can be somehow

421
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,959
made anonymous by choosing an

422
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,160
appropriate

423
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,120
dam

424
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
so this would be the only spoiler in my

425
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,560
talk if you are really interested in

426
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
this so kusagawa will be presenting his

427
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,759
results in the last session of the day i

428
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,600
highly recommend attending his talk if

429
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
you are interested in this line of work

430
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,680
but

431
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
i'll be just

432
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,199
talking a bit about his work so on a

433
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,600
high level so we have been focusing on

434
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
this two keypad notion of anonymity

435
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,959
which makes analysis a bit non-trivial

436
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,680
but kusagawa relied on a single keypad

437
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
notion known as strong pseudorandomness

438
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,079
and it turns out that if a pk scheme

439
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,480
satisfies this strong pseudo randomness

440
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
then it automatically satisfies

441
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,560
anonymity you get anonymity for free

442
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
so then since you can focus all of your

443
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
analysis in the single keypad setting it

444
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,079
makes analysis a bit tractable

445
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,600
but one final thing i want to remark

446
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,839
about kusakawa stock because uh

447
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,160
kuska will be talking more about

448
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,519
his results in later on is that he was

449
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
able to show anonymity of classic

450
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,759
by somehow modifying the assumptions

451
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,199
used by classic michaelis for its

452
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
incision security

453
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
whereas in our work wherever possible we

454
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,880
want to stick to the same assumptions

455
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
used by these nest candidates for the

456
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
ncc security we don't want to introduce

457
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
any new assumptions

458
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
right so this is it for classic michilis

459
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
so now let's move on to

460
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,480
kyber and saber

461
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
so the reason i grouped these two

462
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
schemes together will be made clear

463
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,959
later on

464
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,000
but now here is again our uh

465
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
camden composition result

466
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,160
and it can be shown that the base picky

467
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,079
scheme used by kyber both kyber and

468
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,720
saber does satisfy gamma splitness for a

469
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,799
sufficiently large for

470
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,520
cryptographically large gamma

471
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,199
so that's that's great

472
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
so now we only need to show that if

473
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
these chems satisfy anonymity then we

474
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,439
get back a pk scheme with the desired

475
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,679
properties

476
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
now here was the effort transform that i

477
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
showed earlier on from the literature

478
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
for which we do have some positive

479
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
anonymity results

480
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
however

481
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,919
the effort transform used by crystal

482
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,160
scarborough and sabre they differ from

483
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
the standard effort transformation in

484
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
the literature in quite significant ways

485
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
so uh

486
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
just to uh give you a high level

487
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
overview so in the standard for

488
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
transformation literature

489
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,720
the derived key the key derivation works

490
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
by first sampling a random message

491
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
encrypting the message then you have the

492
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
message m and the ciphertext c and then

493
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,200
you hash m and c to get your key

494
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
but in crystal skyward and saber you

495
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
first hash the message g of m

496
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
and then you also hash the ciphertext f

497
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,280
of c and then you hash both those hashes

498
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
like there's too much hashes going on

499
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,918
like y

500
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
and uh because of this additional layer

501
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
of hashing unfortunately we couldn't

502
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
extend our positive results with respect

503
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
to the standard for transform to this

504
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
specific weird transform of kyber and

505
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,679
sabre

506
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,679
but what's more interesting

507
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,240
is that the same barriers should also

508
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
apply when you try to extend the ncc

509
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,640
security proof of gm guitar of the

510
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
standard for transformation in the

511
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
literature to the specific effort

512
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,679
transform used by kyber and sabre

513
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,120
at least to end things on a some

514
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
somewhat brighter note we were at least

515
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
able to show that when you when you come

516
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,559
to robustness

517
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,120
uh the chem used by the the chem of

518
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,360
carbohydrate and saver it does satisfy

519
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
some robustness in double quotes because

520
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,120
recall that implicit rejection camps

521
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,039
cannot be robust by definition

522
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,559
but somehow they satisfy this weak

523
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,960
property that it is hard to come up with

524
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
the ciphertext such that if you

525
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
decapsulate using two different secret

526
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,679
keys the outputs should not be the same

527
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,360
the outputs would be valid for short but

528
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
it should not collide

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
and we showed that this requirement is

530
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
enough to show that if you choose your

531
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,640
dem uh appropriately then your final pk

532
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,679
scheme can be made strongly robust

533
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,120
so there is a way there is some hope

534
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
there is a way to achieve uh strong load

535
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,240
business

536
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,520
in the pk schemes of kyber and sabre

537
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,960
but this is in contrast to classic

538
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
mechanics because no matter how clever

539
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
how strong you make your them

540
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
classically speaking schemes cannot be

541
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
made robust

542
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
and finally uh let's come to freudicam

543
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
the alternate candidate

544
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
again it can be shown that the base pk

545
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
scheme used by frodo chem does satisfy

546
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
this notion of gamma spreadness

547
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
and now the only thing that needs to be

548
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
looked at is does it satisfy anonymity

549
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
again this is the standard effort

550
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
transformation in the literature and

551
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,159
this is the weird f4 transformation used

552
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,760
by photochem

553
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,320
again it differs things again there are

554
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,039
some subtle differences so again in f4

555
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,840
the key is derived as hash of m and c

556
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
but here now there's only one hash which

557
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
only the messages hashta hash in a

558
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
nested way but the ciphertext is left

559
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,159
alone

560
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,440
so it's slightly uh good thing because

561
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
uh

562
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,600
yeah only initial hashing of m and not c

563
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,320
because even though again uh the prior

564
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
proof techniques does not necessarily

565
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
apply to frodo came in a direct way

566
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
we were able to in our work we were able

567
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,559
to recover the incision security

568
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
guarantees of photochem with the same

569
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
problem with the same concrete bounds as

570
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
stated in the specification document

571
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
solely because of the fact that the

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,880
cipher text is untouched but the message

573
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,000
is hashed in a nested way and the hash

574
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
is also a length preserving hash as in

575
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
g of m g of m has the same length as uh

576
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,799
as that of m so i won't be going to

577
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,400
details but if you're interested i would

578
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
encourage you to read our paper

579
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,159
and this way of the because of the way

580
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,600
that we recovered in cc security

581
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,760
guarantees of photochem it also allowed

582
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,799
us to prove anonymity of freudicam as

583
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,120
well in the queue with concrete bounds

584
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
and hence if you again care about

585
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,200
robustness as we have seen for kyber and

586
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
sabre by choosing our dem appropriately

587
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
uh we conclude that photo cam does

588
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,679
result in anonymous and robust pk

589
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,600
schemes in a post condom setting our

590
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
goal that we set out with in the

591
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,000
beginning of this talk

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
and for a few other contributions

593
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
so we have been focusing on for

594
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
transformations which result in implicit

595
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
rejection chems

596
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
but there is a nfo transformation uh in

597
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
the literature which results in explicit

598
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
rejection games note here that the

599
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,559
encapsulation does result an error such

600
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
that uh so jiang zhang and ma they

601
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,919
showed that this transformation

602
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
does have probable security guarantees

603
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,919
uh in the queue room

604
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,559
it does it in ncc security cams

605
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
in our work which uh so the only

606
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,120
difference in the hfo transformation is

607
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,799
that now your ciphertext has an

608
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,840
additional hash here c2

609
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,360
where you has the m as well so this is

610
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,400
somehow called the plain text

611
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,559
confirmation hash so your ciphertext is

612
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,120
a bit longer but it's fine

613
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,320
at least to prove security in the queue

614
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,080
in our work we showed that if you

615
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,679
replace this hash

616
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
by another hash like

617
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,000
where you also hatch the c1

618
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,880
then

619
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
it turns out that this transformation

620
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
not only does it result in ncc secured

621
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,520
camps but also anonymous and strongly

622
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
robust camps in the q rom

623
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
and it's nice thing because now we can

624
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
just take such a cam and apply our

625
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
earlier camden composition result

626
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,360
without caring a lot about the internal

627
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,440
workings of the chem in a non-black box

628
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,880
manner

629
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,640
so to conclude my talk

630
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,360
so here uh we started by showing that

631
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,919
how one can hope to achieve anonymous

632
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,320
and robust hybrid pk schemes when the

633
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,159
starting chem is an implicit rejection

634
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,320
came as is the case for most nist

635
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
candidates

636
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
and the the main thing that we showed is

637
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,440
that we can overcome such impossibility

638
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
results by looking at such implicit

639
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
rejection camps in a non-black box

640
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
manner

641
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
so namely uh we focused on camps which

642
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,159
are obtained by this effort

643
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,320
transformation and then we showed that

644
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,799
such fo-based camps do result in uh

645
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,320
anonymous and rubish games in a

646
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
post-quantum setting and which could

647
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
also result in anonymous robust hybrid

648
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
pk schemes in the end

649
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
and then we did a case study of the nist

650
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,799
finally so here we have some summary

651
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
again so we showed that classic

652
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,159
michaelis hybrid pk schemes cannot be

653
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,240
robust unfortunately

654
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
but they can be made anonymous uh as

655
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,640
shown by kusagawa again if you're

656
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
interested please do attend his talk

657
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,440
which later on

658
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
then coming to kyber and sabre we

659
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
identified some barriers towards proving

660
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
that in cc security and also anonymity

661
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
uh but somehow we were able to show that

662
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,120
they do result in strongly robust hybrid

663
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
pk schemes uh so one thing one thing

664
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
worth pointing out is that even kusagawa

665
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,760
leaves proving anonymity of kyber and

666
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039
saber to be an open problem

667
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
and finally to end things on a positive

668
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,039
note we showed that the alternate

669
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,559
candidate for a chem does result in

670
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,320
anonymous and rubbished hybrid pk

671
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,039
schemes in the queue

672
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,559
so this brings me to the end of my talk

673
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,840
uh thanks for your attention

674
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,600
thank you very much

675
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,240
so if there's any questions please

676
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
either type them in zulu or go to a

677
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:46,800
microphone

678
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,720
[Music]

679
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,039
yes

680
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,400
you mentioned that in the security proof

681
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,720
for photocam here

682
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
you derived some concrete parameters or

683
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
some security losses can you comment on

684
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
roughly how big they are

685
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,000
uh yeah so generally uh security proofs

686
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,919
in the queue rom tend to be non-tight

687
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,120
compared to their rom counterparts

688
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,559
so one

689
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,679
not sure if it's a fortunate or an

690
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
unfortunate thing is that yeah security

691
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
proof in the q rom tend to be non tight

692
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,679
but if you look at these concrete

693
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,080
parameters in their next candidates like

694
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
the specification documents they choose

695
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,080
a parameters not based on the tightness

696
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
of the security proof but on the worst

697
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,360
on the best known attacks on their

698
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,480
underlying lattices so yeah maybe

699
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,919
from a very pessimistic point of view

700
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
you can say that maybe these tightness

701
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,039
of the security group doesn't really

702
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
matter in choosing the concrete

703
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,960
parameters in the scheme but still it

704
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
should at least give us some confidence

705
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,559
uh in terms of provable security

706
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,679
guarantees so yeah i would say that the

707
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,159
the proofs are non-tight but they're not

708
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,720
used to select the parameters so just a

709
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
bit more specifically is it like a

710
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
linear in the number of quantum noun

711
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,640
oracle calls well it's quadratic

712
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,679
quadratic okay thank you

713
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
okay there's time for one small question

714
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,039
yeah please go to the microphone

715
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,679
you said that uh

716
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,720
to get uh certainly even if you start

717
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,880
from cca secure and see anonymous scam

718
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,919
uh

719
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,840
the transformation to see an anonymous

720
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,480
encryption

721
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
somewhat surprisingly requires some form

722
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,039
of robustness

723
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,120
i don't believe you

724
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,159
gave an explanation why

725
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,919
yeah

726
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
so yeah that's a good question so um

727
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,480
so i did uh talk about earlier on that

728
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
this which is somehow

729
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
not only sufficient but also necessary

730
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
because we came with an artificial

731
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
counter example where if you have a chem

732
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,159
which satisfies anonymity in the cca

733
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,520
intuitively okay

734
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,640
yeah uh

735
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,919
so i'll be going to the integrated

736
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,400
details of the security proof but let's

737
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,880
say okay so the cipher text the hybrid

738
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
cipher text right it's made up of a chem

739
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,120
component and a dem component

740
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,799
right and you want to reduce it to the

741
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,679
anonymity of the chem

742
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,840
right so now somehow

743
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,640
uh

744
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,520
you want to make sure that so if you are

745
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
the adversary

746
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
against the anonymity of the chem you

747
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,039
only have the decapitation access to a

748
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,799
decapitation oracle

749
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,480
and not access to the hybrid decryption

750
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
oracle

751
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
so you somehow want to make sure that if

752
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
the adversary

753
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,919
against the anonymity of the hybrid

754
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,399
scheme if he gives you a cipher text

755
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,840
which has

756
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
the chem component to be the challenge

757
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
ciphertext but the dim could be anything

758
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
you want to return

759
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,480
an error with respect to both the

760
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,840
capsulation oracles against sk0 and sk1

761
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
so for that you somehow need weak

762
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
robustness

763
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
i'm sorry if i have to be very but i can

764
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
we can discuss it often if you're really

765
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,200
uh

766
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
i'll be present i won't be hiding in the

767
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,559
coffee break

768
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,039
i'll i'll grab hold of him for you so he

769
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,240
can't escape um so with that

770
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,679
that concludes the session so let's

771
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,720
thank

772
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,120
speaker again

773
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,799
you
