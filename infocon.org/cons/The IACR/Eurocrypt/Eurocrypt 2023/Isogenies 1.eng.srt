1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,780
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,920
please take a seat

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,040
and welcome to this already last

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,240
session for today

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,060
because we have our free afternoon but

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,220
at least it's not the final session for

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,000
today

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,580
but the last with uh yeah technical

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,400
contributions and I'm really glad my

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
name is yopobos that I can chair this

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,580
session

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,299
related to isogenes

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,640
you probably have heard already or have

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,920
seen the impact of some of these talks

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
and we start I'm really glad with the

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
best paper award the official ceremony

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,820
for this will be this evening and then

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,579
later we have three talks in total in

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,800
this session two honorable mentions also

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,239
related to this important isogeny work

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,059
important in terms of impact for many

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,579
PhD students and postdocs but also for

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,500
industry

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,960
um there has been a lot of impact with

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,360
the results of these papers so without

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,280
further Ado let me

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,760
introduce the paper by Walter kostrik

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,860
and tomodokru on an efficient key

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,000
recovery attack on sidh

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,979
thank you for the introduction so I'll

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,479
be talking about an efficient key

32
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,580
recovery attack on sidh which is joint

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,060
work with

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,560
so for those of you who don't know sidh

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,420
stands for super singular isageny Diffie

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,560
helmets so we're going to do a key

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,380
exchange it was first discovered in 2011

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,020
by Luca Di fio and David Zhao because if

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,640
you're sitting there

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
and previously the security was well

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,900
established for generic attacks both

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,479
classical and Quantum we had exponential

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,759
time but there were some issues

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
in the sense that if you took unbalanced

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
parameters it was unsafe but also some

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,460
chosen ciphert ciphertext attacks and

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,700
didn't allow for a static key

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,920
however this was changed by a key

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
encapsulation and then this got

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,820
submitted to the nist post Quantum

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,680
standardization process

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,440
and early July previous previous year

53
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,180
this actually Advanced to the fourth

54
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,800
round

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,480
um in a post Quantum standardization

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,500
process as one of only four contenders

57
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,879
but in this work we're going to show how

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,540
we can classically break sidh and well

59
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,520
at least psych and polynomial time and

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,620
depending on the instantiation of sidh

61
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,720
and

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,959
sub-exponential time

63
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,400
what's an exogeny I'm assuming not

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,620
everybody knows what an isotony is in

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,360
the simplest sense an isogeny is a map

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
from one elliptic curve to another and

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,560
it's a map so typically we denote this

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
by arrows

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,500
and it has many interesting properties

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,940
but for the sake of this presentation

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,519
you only need to know two properties

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,800
one of them is that an isogeny has a

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,459
degree for instance this point on the

74
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,680
second curve has three pre-images

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,360
that means that all points in this Curve

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,459
will have three pre-images and this will

77
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,440
be a tree isotony because the degree of

78
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,480
this isageny is tree

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,160
so this is the first

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,660
property that we're going to need but

81
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,400
what you can also do with maps is you

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,260
can concatenate Maps

83
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,879
so let's say we have another map from

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,959
the second place that you need to a

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,640
third is actually

86
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,000
and now this has two pre-images this

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,860
will then be in two isogenes so nice

88
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,840
actually you have to create two and by

89
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,540
simple concatenation you can see that

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,000
this point then has six pre-images so

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
concatenations of maps means

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,440
multiplication of isogenes

93
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,859
okay

94
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,900
if you remember this slide then I feel

95
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,280
like you'll be able to follow the rest

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,379
of the talk with one small remark we're

97
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,879
going to remove the arrows for the

98
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,739
simple reason that every isogony of the

99
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,379
degree has a dual exogeny so there's

100
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,060
also an isolation of degree six going

101
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,739
from the third curve to the first curve

102
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,480
and so on it's not really an inverse but

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,220
you can think of it as an inverse if you

104
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,400
wish

105
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
so sidh the element key exchange we're

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,440
going to work with Alice and Bob Alice

107
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,940
and Bob want to exchange some key over

108
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,099
some possibly insecured Channel

109
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,220
the I and sidh stands for isogenes which

110
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,860
now already know enough about and the

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,659
Snee stands for Supercenter

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,100
now what does Super singular mean

113
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,298
technically I'm not going to explain it

114
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,580
mathematically but allows Alice and Bob

115
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,979
to work with a well-defined or

116
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,400
well-behaving set of elliptic Curves in

117
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,199
particular it's a finite set which is

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,820
nice in cryptographic settings we're

119
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,979
talking about 2 to the 400 or more

120
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,139
curves but for this toy example I've

121
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,340
given both of them 20 elliptic curves

122
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,320
obviously we cannot store two to four

123
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,699
hundred elliptic curves

124
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,620
so there's like one starting curve that

125
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,960
we choose and then Allison Bob will use

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,380
isogenes to actually compute along a

127
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,300
large degree isageny and this toy

128
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,860
example again this is not going to be a

129
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,020
large exogeny but just something simpler

130
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,000
and for technical reasons they need to

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,360
use co-prand degree isagenes and the

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,880
smaller the isogenic degree is the

133
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,440
easier it is to actually compute an

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
isotony so this model's primes are two

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,639
and three typically Alice uses two

136
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,800
isogenes and Bob uses three isogenes

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,139
okay so Alice starts Alice is going to

138
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,880
compute a synchronize actually has many

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,380
options she starts with an issue of

140
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,680
degree 2. 4 8 16 32 64.

141
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
and then she stops now keep in mind this

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
is not an Arbitrage Choice she doesn't

143
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,220
choose to stop at degree 64. she just

144
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,320
this is really inherent to the system

145
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,139
she cannot stop at 32 or something she

146
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
really needs to do an isogeny obviously

147
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,220
64. and Bob does something similar

148
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,960
degree three

149
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,699
9 27 81 and then he stops

150
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,979
again another choice at least not a

151
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,720
choice at the moment this is inherent to

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,860
the system

153
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,720
now in typical diffie-hellman style what

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,639
do they want to do then obviously they

155
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,080
want to perform a key exchange right

156
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,900
Alice sends her curve to Bob Bob sends

157
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,520
his curve to Alice

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,020
and then they want to do the similar

159
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,419
isotony chain starting from each other's

160
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,400
curve

161
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,020
now the big question is how can they do

162
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,198
that

163
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,120
and the answer is they can't at least

164
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,860
not at this point they are lacking

165
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,380
information there's no way for Alice to

166
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,300
interpret her Isaac new her secret Isaac

167
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,639
need just from Bob's curve it's not

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,259
possible it's not visual on this

169
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,819
graphical representation but there's

170
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,100
information missing for the simple

171
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,240
reason that it's not really a

172
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,160
commutative action

173
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,080
so we're going to start over

174
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,180
and in small you see that the starting

175
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,639
curve of Alice now has two points which

176
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,919
will allow Bob to actually interpret his

177
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,800
secret isageny from Alice's curve hence

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,780
the same color as the isogenes that Bob

179
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,039
will use

180
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,199
and Alice computes the exact same degree

181
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,460
64 isageny

182
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,380
however now at the final curve she also

183
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,819
has two points

184
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,880
and Bob does the same phrase 81 degree

185
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,780
81 isotony

186
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,340
and now instead of just exchanging

187
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,360
elliptic curves they're going to

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,919
exchange elliptic curves with extra

189
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,319
points and these points these auxiliary

190
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,960
auxiliary points actually allow Alice to

191
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,060
interpret her secret isageny whichever

192
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,740
she chose

193
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,419
exactly

194
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,840
as needed to end up and this curve

195
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,900
called Els plus Bob and Bob can do the

196
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,759
same

197
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,220
and he ends up in the same curve

198
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,319
now they've exchange the key they end up

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,580
in the same curve they can use the J

200
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,319
invariant or whatever they want for this

201
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,660
curve but in the end they just end up on

202
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,940
the same curve

203
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,800
um it's very essential without these

204
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,099
auxiliary points the protocol does not

205
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,380
work but these points are also what is

206
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,440
what makes the protocol insecure

207
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,479
so the way we're going to attack is

208
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,580
is actually a full key recovery on Bob's

209
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,580
secret key so his secret isageny

210
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,539
um and we're going to do that by

211
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,880
building an oracle which basically

212
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,800
predicts what was his last step

213
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,139
was it E1 E2 E3 or E4

214
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,880
now as you can see this is only a chain

215
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,680
of length four so three to the fourth

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,419
but in practice for cryptographic

217
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,060
parameters this is a couple hundred long

218
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,520
at most but you can see that iteratively

219
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,860
you can just if you can make an oracle

220
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,479
that can predict this you can make an

221
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,360
oracle which can iteratively recover the

222
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,080
entire secret isageny from Bob okay so

223
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,360
our question is which one is these is

224
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
the last step and maybe it's worth

225
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,799
noting is that the correct one is an

226
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,200
isolation of degree 27 removed from E

227
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,940
start right because the last one was

228
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,380
degree 81.

229
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,779
so one of these is an isotony of degree

230
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,120
27 removed from the starting curve

231
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,920
we're going to have to go to a higher

232
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,500
Dimension quite literally and talk about

233
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,959
a billion surfaces how can we construct

234
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,519
an abelian surface which is the

235
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,620
generalization of an elliptic curve

236
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,420
uh pretty simple actually most people

237
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,339
have seen in elementary school what a

238
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,959
number line is and at a certain point

239
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,940
you said okay let's call one of them an

240
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,480
X axis and the other y-axis and now we

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,279
were component wise and we just make a

242
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,260
plane right you can do the same with two

243
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,000
elliptic curves just take one elliptic

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
curve another one and now you say okay

245
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,440
two components we have a surface

246
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,700
and you can do aromatic with that as

247
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,440
well and you also can do isogenes

248
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,839
between a billion surfaces as well as

249
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,339
you can probably see there's a lot of

250
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,680
them so I'll be not drawing the full

251
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,380
picture here even for the degree 2 case

252
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,360
and two Dimensions it's already 15

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
options just to start for a degree three

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,860
case we're at 40 options so we're not

255
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,300
going to be drawing that

256
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,220
maybe we're noting that the common

257
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,440
notation is the correct mathematical

258
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,260
notation too sort of display the

259
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,019
two-dimensionality here

260
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,540
but we got more info right we didn't

261
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,040
just have the courage we also had the

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,360
points on the curve built on the

263
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,160
starting curve and on the ending curve

264
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
of a bob but we can easily push those to

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
the e i as well okay

266
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,100
now

267
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,459
the points on evolve allow

268
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,380
Alice to interpreter is actually of

269
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,740
degree 236 and one Dimensions however

270
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,019
if you actually embed this into this

271
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,120
civilian surface this information

272
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,760
determines a unique isogeny between a

273
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,680
billion surfaces so in a way it's

274
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,480
interesting to look at this unique

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,260
isogeny

276
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,940
as per usual you can decompose and is

277
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,100
actually two to the six and six I just

278
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,140
needs of degree two the same holds in

279
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,360
two dimensions that's normal but you may

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,579
one you may be wondering now like okay

281
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,380
what is this is this still on a billion

282
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,839
surface this looks very different

283
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
um yeah it's still on a billion surface

284
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,339
for the reason that there's actually two

285
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,200
types of a billion surface one of them

286
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,019
consists of pair of elliptic curves and

287
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,760
the other consists of a hyper elliptic

288
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,720
curve of genus two

289
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,920
um for those of you don't know what a

290
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,500
hyperlip curve of genes 2 is basically a

291
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,120
curve with two holes whereas an elliptic

292
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,920
curve is curved with one hole so either

293
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,260
you want two holes either you want two

294
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,480
elliptic curves or one hyper elliptic

295
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,260
curve in this sense

296
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,360
but more importantly here actually is

297
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,860
well

298
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,040
the first type so the pairs of elliptic

299
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,800
curve are a lot more rare even in this

300
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,959
toy example only like four percent of

301
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,800
them

302
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,779
four percent of a billion surfaces are

303
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,700
actually pairs of elliptic curve or

304
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,079
constructed from pairs of elliptic

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,839
curves whereas the overwhelming majority

306
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,899
is of the second type okay that's going

307
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,920
to be important for the attack

308
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,620
and the attack relies on a theorem by

309
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,040
Adams County from 1997 already

310
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,540
the theorem is a lot more Technical and

311
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,040
mathematical so I'm going to skip over

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,600
all the details here

313
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,040
um

314
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,800
but apply to sidh in essence what it

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
says if you start from an abelian

316
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,519
surface which is a product of elliptic

317
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,920
curves when will you end up again on

318
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,019
this rare occasion so when will this new

319
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,300
abelian Surface be constructed again

320
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,399
from a product of elliptic curves

321
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,779
so we're starting from a special

322
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,120
situation when are we ending up again in

323
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
a special situation right

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,399
and this happens only if and only if so

325
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,860
it's full characterization if you have a

326
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,079
degree M times an isogony

327
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,360
and dimension one and you are also given

328
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,600
the point information for an M plus an

329
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,360
exogeny if you then do it this way then

330
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
you will end up on a product of elliptic

331
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,579
curves again

332
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,880
mathematical speeding speaking I think

333
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,740
this is quite interesting and one

334
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,959
dimensional case you have well a

335
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,760
multiplication of degrees but that makes

336
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,279
sense right a lot of maps multiply their

337
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,440
degree but for some reason for isogenes

338
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,420
you can embed this into a higher

339
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,399
Dimension and then actually talk about

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,160
addition of degrees which I don't think

341
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,839
is something that occurs that often

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,899
should we now be surprised with this

343
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,180
knowledge that in the previous examples

344
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,459
if we like put e start and EI together

345
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,560
that we ended up and in a billion

346
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,880
surface constructed from a hyper

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,079
elliptic curve

348
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,060
well no there's such an English degree

349
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,680
226 and dimension two

350
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,139
and if we assume that REI was the

351
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,700
correct one so we guessed correctly

352
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,620
correctly already

353
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,620
then this one was a 27 isageny away from

354
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,880
E start

355
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
so if you want to put this into Carney's

356
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,100
theorem we would need to factor 27 into

357
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,160
integers which sum up to 64 but in

358
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,339
general factors of

359
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,980
of 27 are divisible by 3 so we can't

360
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,320
really do that and in general you can

361
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,820
never do that so this should not be a

362
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,180
surprise

363
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,639
but we're trying to attack something so

364
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,980
we can do some little bit of extra

365
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,079
work if we want and we can actually

366
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,959
compute an extra isogeny here to this

367
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,839
new curve elliptic curve extra cold

368
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,940
and the size engine will be of degree 26

369
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,800
minus 3 cubed

370
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,779
and why exactly well simply because

371
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,760
these two numbers add up to 2 to the

372
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,459
power 6 right it's exactly Connie's

373
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,839
Criterion and the only thing we need to

374
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,320
do is

375
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
change this e start at the bottom to the

376
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,279
E extra

377
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,260
and then we're perfectly in kani's

378
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,300
Criterion and we're in this exceptional

379
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,339
case

380
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,440
now the important thing to notice this

381
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,320
only works if the e i as the correct one

382
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,519
right

383
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,519
because this purple pink magenta

384
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,800
whatever isageny needs to be an isogeny

385
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,980
of degree 27. but the other EI are

386
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,620
almost surely no isageny of degree 27

387
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,620
removed from E start in which case this

388
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,839
sum would never match out and we would

389
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,180
not have an isotony of degree to the sex

390
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,740
so that's essentially the Oracle which

391
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,500
is trial and error we just take this e

392
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,579
extra

393
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,500
put it together with E1 and an evilian

394
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,060
surface and we compute this unique

395
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,060
isogeny and then we see okay

396
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,399
bad luck it's not an Abilene surface

397
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,820
constructed from a hyper elliptic curve

398
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,480
E2 just the same E3

399
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,060
just the same

400
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,639
and then E4 okay perfect we end up on a

401
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,500
pair of elliptic curves again

402
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,839
we sort of win because

403
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,459
this is only possible if we actually

404
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,860
choose E4 to be the correct one and it

405
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,480
will not be possible otherwise

406
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,380
I know this is only for E4 but you can

407
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,639
it relatively backtrack the entire

408
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,620
secretary from Bob this way

409
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,100
something that I've sort of really swept

410
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,899
under the rug here is how do we compute

411
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,839
these isagenies for toy examples this is

412
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,240
easy because this is a small number

413
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,959
but for concrete parameters A and B are

414
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,740
let's say 100 to 400 roughly

415
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,199
how can we compute

416
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,180
an isogony of that degree because that's

417
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,040
not always easy

418
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,860
and the initial psych submission and the

419
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,680
starting curve was this e0

420
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
and it has a specialized actually

421
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,660
called Yota from e0 to itself which is

422
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,160
also possible it doesn't have to be in

423
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,620
different elliptic curve and it sort of

424
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,360
acts like multiplication by the square

425
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
root of minus one

426
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,740
without going into detail this allows

427
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,160
for enough choices of A and B to

428
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,740
actually compute this extra isogeny on

429
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,360
the starting curve itself

430
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,420
in terms of time complexity we're

431
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,279
talking about milliseconds simply

432
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,019
because it's roughly a scalar

433
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,279
multiplication

434
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,959
so this is very easy to do

435
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,500
later sex emissions used a different

436
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,640
curve

437
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
but something similar applies there for

438
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,599
a simple reason that it's only a 2

439
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,579
isotony away from this e0

440
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,319
so you can compute a very easy to

441
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,540
compute two-ways originally do the same

442
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,720
trick on e0 and then just move back to e

443
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,419
start and again Computing and I search

444
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,919
you have to create two to the a minus 3

445
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,740
to the B is milliseconds word

446
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,260
more generally for sidh

447
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,960
you can do a similar trick but with more

448
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,360
involved Yota

449
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,799
if you know all the isotonies from

450
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,780
estar2 itself

451
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,059
but this is a hard problem so this is

452
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,280
definitely not always known just finding

453
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,740
a description of all isogenes from a

454
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,160
curve to itself is not easy for

455
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,380
cryptographic parameters and if this is

456
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,720
not possible then we hope that this is a

457
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,120
smooth number so we hope that this does

458
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,000
not have large prime factors but for the

459
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,140
people who work with integer

460
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,120
factorization we'll probably realize if

461
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,080
a and b are like 100 to 410 well this

462
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,799
has large prime factors period you're

463
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,600
never lucky enough that this is smooth

464
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,220
there's some leeway in our attack which

465
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,620
allows us to find smooth expressions of

466
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,000
the following form

467
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,620
you have like four parameters to play

468
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,840
with which which all have a slightly

469
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,120
different interpretation

470
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,340
for example you can guess a part of bulb

471
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,740
secretization but you can also do some

472
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,200
extra isotony computation in dimension

473
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,780
one or even two and so on

474
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,559
um

475
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,179
so as soon as we find a smooth enough

476
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,400
expression of this form our attack

477
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,500
applies and it was then pointed out to

478
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,780
us by Luca diffio and Benjamin

479
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,820
mavislovsky that is this a

480
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,559
sub-exponential attack even in the worst

481
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,740
case

482
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,020
but I said before for psych this wasn't

483
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,520
an issue

484
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,419
um

485
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,220
because this extra isotony was

486
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,620
negligible and a complete story so we

487
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,900
had something polynomial time but also

488
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,360
practical polynomial time so the first

489
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,220
two are the Microsoft challenges uh

490
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,500
second one was the 50 000 challenge

491
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,140
which was not claimed yet uh broken in

492
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,400
85 seconds

493
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,960
and the rest for the nist level

494
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,600
Securities the highest level was broken

495
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,220
in three hours and everything else

496
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,660
within one hour

497
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,260
so this is my last slide so instead of a

498
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,400
conclusion I wanted to put something

499
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,720
else there because I've heard some

500
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
people talk about how exogeny based

501
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,020
crypto is dead but this is definitely

502
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,940
not the case

503
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,340
um because to make this stack work we

504
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,960
really need two key ingredients for

505
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
example we need to know that Alice and

506
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,640
Bob use a fixed degree isageny and we

507
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,679
need to know the degree and we also need

508
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,660
to know these extra points these

509
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,340
auxiliary points that they exchange with

510
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,639
one another

511
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,120
now in general

512
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
this information is not provided and

513
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,679
other cryptographic schemes such as

514
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,780
Seaside which is also a key exchange

515
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,940
protocol but you don't know either of

516
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,280
them so this attack does not apply to

517
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,039
seaside's key sign most of the sidh and

518
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,380
so on So isotony based crypto is

519
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,200
definitely not that sidh is insecure yes

520
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,820
but

521
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,780
only that really

522
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,740
I've also written a blog post of this

523
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,340
talk with some references including uh

524
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,320
reference to Connie's theorem and so on

525
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,080
so you can click true on that

526
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,880
I hope you enjoyed the talk thank you

527
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,860
for your attention and I'm open to it to

528
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,459
answer any questions

529
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,539
if you have a question please come to

530
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,700
the front and ask it in a mic

531
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,179
no so let me

532
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,539
start with a question then so you ended

533
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:05,340
your presentation that I saw Ginny based

534
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,900
crypto is not dead

535
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,460
far from far from that I think a lot of

536
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,500
Outsiders would perceive that it is at

537
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,620
least a bit wounded

538
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,760
based on this work and the following

539
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,039
presentations in this session

540
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,200
how how do you see the future of

541
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,480
isogeneous crypto do you do you still

542
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
see a path towards schemes which can be

543
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,919
used in standardized in post Quantum

544
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,059
crypto

545
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,600
and maybe strange way to Outsider I see

546
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,299
more Avenues to be

547
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,059
um explored now because of Carney's

548
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,799
theorem we can go to higher dimensions

549
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,840
and actually make things

550
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,640
more interesting computationally certain

551
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,679
things become easier for examples key

552
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,480
signings mentions here now digital ready

553
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,820
is key sign higher Dimensions which has

554
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,900
a lot faster signing time for example so

555
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,640
if anything this is like an opportunity

556
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,020
to actually

557
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,659
like find new avenues which we have not

558
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:01,799
really

559
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,780
looked at previously

560
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,179
so I think in general higher Dimensions

561
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,980
will have to be taken into account in

562
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,440
the future of a resident-based crypto

563
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,280
and

564
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
certain things they will be and I'm

565
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
assuming that they will be used

566
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,799
constructively as well

567
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,940
thanks any other questions

568
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,090
if not then let's thank Thomas again

569
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:36,988
[Applause]

570
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,140
then we continue from an efficient key

571
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,620
recovery attack on sidh to a direct key

572
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,500
recovery attack

573
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,400
this is a work by Luciano myino Chloe

574
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,220
Martindale Lawrence Penny yokomo Pope

575
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,360
and Benjamin velavoski and Luciano will

576
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,100
give the presentation when it's ready

577
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,039
okay so thanks and hi everyone

578
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,799
so today I'm going to present this work

579
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,559
a direct Q recovery attack on sadh this

580
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,260
is Joint work with Chloe Martindale

581
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,419
Lauren spani Giacomo Pope and

582
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,760
measurement

583
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,100
so this work is actually a merge of two

584
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,460
different papers one by myself and Chloe

585
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,559
Martindale and another one by Benjamin

586
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,840
with a lot of scheme in the first paper

587
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,260
we show an attack on this at the age

588
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,299
when the starting curve is actually an

589
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,580
arbitrary starting curve so we can't use

590
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,980
the knowledge of the normal friends ring

591
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,700
and this work is independent from the

592
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,480
work presented before by Thomas

593
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,000
and actually there is also another paper

594
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,820
a bench one by Benjamin with a lot of

595
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,020
scheme

596
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,320
he describes a polynomial time attack

597
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,140
when the um the normal friends ring of

598
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,240
the starting curve is known

599
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,120
and differently from the strategy

600
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,220
described in the previous talk rather

601
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,860
than using this trial and error strategy

602
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,299
to recover the secret key and going

603
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,940
through all the possible uh going all

604
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,559
these steps

605
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,460
um constituting the secret key which is

606
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,820
like an esogenic computed by Bob we

607
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,760
provide a direct a direct key approach

608
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,299
the Direct Key recovery to this is

609
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,059
um to recompute this I saw genuine

610
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,039
also we provide the proof of concept

611
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,919
implementation and this has mainly been

612
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,500
developed by Lawrence pania and Giacomo

613
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,760
Pope and it's free available on GitHub

614
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,340
okay so I'm not going to introduce Again

615
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,220
The sadhq Exchange rather I will

616
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,740
describe what the hardness assumption

617
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,500
what's actually the hard problem

618
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,140
underlying sadh so this problem is

619
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,179
called the super singular exogeny with

620
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,919
torsion

621
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,120
and it's the following so we have a

622
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,539
prime P which is a big Prime and then we

623
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,240
have two public elliptic curves each

624
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,000
start and e-bob and the secret the cell

625
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
genify Bob

626
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,020
originating from a start and mapping

627
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,840
onto a bob so there's such a neat secret

628
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,880
but actually the degree of this

629
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,460
assertion is known and is equal to 3 to

630
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,860
the B also we are given additional

631
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,140
information which is the image of the

632
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,140
228 torsion of his start under the

633
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,179
secret test of Jennifer Bob

634
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,460
so having this knowledge having this

635
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,039
data we want to recompute we want to

636
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,380
reconstruct the cell genify Bob

637
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,500
so I've used different colors for

638
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,159
different parts of the different bits of

639
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,620
the problem so everything which is blue

640
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,340
will denote public information whereas

641
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,659
the color red would refer to secret

642
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,400
information and I will use this

643
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,900
convention through throughout the talk

644
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,360
okay I'm gonna give like a little bit of

645
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,779
brief history of the SNH problem

646
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,380
so srdh was introduced and in turn also

647
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,500
the its hardness problem was introduced

648
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,520
in 2011 by the field Zhao and plut then

649
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,640
five years later garbage Petit shining

650
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,980
tea give like an active attack on the

651
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,799
key exchange and just one year later

652
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,500
Petit describes passive attack on some

653
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,220
parameter sets but the parameter sets

654
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,380
affected by this attack were not the one

655
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,400
used in the sadh key exchange

656
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
um few years later in 2020 the queen

657
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,159
kutash Leonardi Martindale Pani Petit

658
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,220
stage Giver improved this attack and

659
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,140
give passive attacks on more parameter

660
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,140
sets but they didn't achieve to they

661
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,039
didn't reach sadh parameters the main

662
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,900
reason why it's not possible to achieve

663
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,700
this parameters is the impossibility of

664
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,860
solving certain equations

665
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,799
so we are now in the next slide I'm

666
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,980
gonna try to use a different approach

667
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,799
and okay so let me

668
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,140
recall a little bitty situation

669
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,059
so I've used notation of five bulb to

670
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,279
then I'll to refer to the fact that we

671
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,659
are going to attack the secret

672
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,200
technology computed by Bob so we have e

673
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,419
start which is our starting curve we

674
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,740
have

675
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,960
um an encoding of the two to the a

676
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,720
torsion of e stars and that's public

677
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,220
information

678
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,440
and then we have the

679
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,260
um image curve above and the image of

680
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,480
the East start the of the two to the

681
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,059
torsion of this star under this secretes

682
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,919
of genify Bob

683
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,640
so we have this public information

684
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,039
then to launch the attack we need to

685
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,440
compute an x-raysogeny

686
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,679
this exogeny

687
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,600
Maps

688
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,700
originates from E extra and mapsun to

689
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,460
start and then we need to find

690
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,279
description of the two today torsion on

691
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,400
E extra which matches the constraint of

692
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,559
the public key of the public information

693
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,080
which is like the encoding of the 2 to

694
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,659
Da torsionally start under this secret

695
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,480
exogenify extra

696
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,760
this is a genify extra especially in the

697
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,059
sense that we must have a certain degree

698
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,059
and I'm gonna talk about the degree of

699
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,580
this exogeny in the next slides so right

700
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,980
now we have a couple of blue things on

701
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,779
the slide which means that we have quite

702
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,480
a lot of public information what can we

703
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,120
do with this public information

704
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,559
well

705
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,400
morally we have computed we have a

706
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,260
nasogenic Phi between e extra and ebob

707
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,679
we have also the image of the two today

708
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,159
torsion of EX under this new exogeny Phi

709
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,159
so using this assert Journey we can

710
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,620
actually compute an exogeny between

711
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,679
elliptic products what's an elliptic

712
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,960
product product of two elliptic curves

713
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,059
and we can compute actually this

714
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,960
exogenic Capital Phi which Maps which

715
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,880
originates from ex or time C Bob so ex

716
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,279
tries the assertion that we computed as

717
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,039
the domain of the extra isogeny

718
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,640
auxiliary exogeny and ebob is the

719
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,100
um I saw Jenny part of the public key

720
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,779
Bob's public key

721
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,539
and this I saw Jenny Capital fly maps

722
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,700
onto another elliptic product

723
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,880
and which these elliptic products given

724
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,059
by is start times in known in known is

725
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,100
another curve that is actually not

726
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,440
relevant for the attack so I'm not gonna

727
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,220
talk about the the other of this curve

728
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,000
however one of the main properties of

729
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,559
exogenes between elliptic products is

730
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,539
that it's possible to represent such a

731
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,679
surgeon is using Matrix notation so

732
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,020
using the Matrix form of this Exogen and

733
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,799
capital Phi we have we have a knowledge

734
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,200
of something really relevant for the

735
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,480
attack so the first component of capital

736
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,820
Phi of this Exogen between elliptic

737
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,399
products is actually the isogen Phi

738
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,620
x-ray that was already known that's the

739
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,720
Exogen that we picked to launch the

740
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,659
attack but interestingly in the second

741
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,320
component we have a description of the

742
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,220
Dual of Phi of the secret associate Bob

743
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,700
having like information regarding

744
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,500
um having like a description of the Dual

745
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,720
of this exogeny is actually equivalent

746
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,720
to have their surgery fiber itself

747
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
so well we have reconstructed the

748
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,700
exogeny we have a way to reconstruct the

749
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,919
secret asogenify Bob which means that we

750
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,919
we are successful in our attack also

751
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,659
there are other two different components

752
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,059
for this Matrix form but they are

753
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,220
actually not useful for the attacks so I

754
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,659
kind of omitted the other two components

755
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,880
I said that we can construct this search

756
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,880
and capital Phi using public uh the

757
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,500
public info using public information

758
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
using blue information in the slides

759
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,220
what does it mean then to compute this

760
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,200
exogenic Capital five

761
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,940
we need

762
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,220
um the description of a description of

763
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,220
the 2da torsion e extra and we take this

764
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,020
description and we scale this

765
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,020
description by three to the beam and

766
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,299
this is basically just a scalar

767
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,299
multiplication and then we have a map of

768
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,220
the exogenify which is the surgeon

769
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,700
between exor and Bob and we have the

770
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,860
image of the this description of the two

771
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,600
to J torsion under this secret

772
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,179
testogenify so everything is blue which

773
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,580
means that everything is public and in

774
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,840
turn that means that we can actually

775
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,320
compute the exogeny capital Phi and as I

776
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,940
said before research in capital Phi

777
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,140
reveals the secretary so well we are

778
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,940
done

779
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,039
now let's move on in the case of the

780
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,899
unknown and the morphine spring I've

781
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,899
been a little I've kind of hided the the

782
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,820
fact that they saw genify x-ray is

783
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,059
special in some way well that's a 25x

784
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,860
right special in the science it must

785
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,580
have degree 2 to the a minus three to B

786
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,220
and this number this value actually may

787
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,500
not be smooth which means that Computing

788
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500
such a misogyny is not easy and makes

789
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,399
the attack really impractical so what we

790
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,799
can actually try to do is rather than

791
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,460
using the the entire 2da torsion and

792
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,580
rather than attacking the entire

793
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,200
isogeneous degree 3 to the B which is

794
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,419
actually the exogeny the secret

795
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,080
isogenify bulb we can try to take some

796
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,299
guesses which means that rather than

797
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,880
attacking the entire length of the

798
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,880
entire chain of three of three isogenes

799
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,120
we attack like a shorter chain and then

800
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,820
rather than using the entire 208 torsion

801
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,679
we we can try to use

802
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,140
and less information regarding to the

803
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,120
day torsion which means that we use the

804
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,659
2 to the a minus J torsion and also we

805
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,940
rather than using the knowledge about

806
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,159
the 238 torch and we can also try to use

807
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,880
we try to guess part of the torsion map

808
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,399
under the secret exogeny

809
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,500
so

810
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,679
using for finding these parameters once

811
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,200
we find these parameters this leads to

812
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,080
an attack of sub-exponential complexity

813
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,179
and the argument for this attack was

814
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,419
suggested by look at FAO

815
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,720
and okay let me explain specifically how

816
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,519
this attack works

817
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,980
so suppose that we have found like nice

818
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,179
parameters

819
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,779
e i and J so we can actually compute the

820
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,120
exogenic Phi X from which has kind of

821
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,059
smoother degree then once we have this

822
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,059
exogenify X from well we start from the

823
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,820
exogenic e-bob which is a part of the

824
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,879
public key Bob's public key we also have

825
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,800
as I said before in the description for

826
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,418
the problem

827
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,719
um the image of the two today torsion

828
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,960
under this Secret exogeny and then we

829
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,480
take guesses from this exogeny bulb

830
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,540
which means that we try to compute all

831
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,080
possible isogenes of degree 3 to the eye

832
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,060
and we Mark these points under this

833
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,940
secret exogeny and for each gas we try

834
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,699
to launch the attack whenever we are

835
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,159
successful

836
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,739
then we have reconstructed the exogeny

837
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,960
Phi which is the surgeon that I have

838
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,060
used before to describe the kernel of

839
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,879
the Exogen between elliptic products

840
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,000
which means that we have construct again

841
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,520
a surgeon of degree three to the

842
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,200
um a minus I between e stars and E gas

843
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
and

844
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,280
three to the B minus I and which means

845
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,020
that we have constructed is the first

846
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,720
steps of this exogeny

847
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,540
and also we we already know the the the

848
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,420
gas part that we have taken which means

849
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,339
that in turn we have reconstructed the

850
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,779
entire Secret exogeny

851
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,400
and now let's move on in the case of

852
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,579
known endomorphism ring so in this case

853
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,460
it's actually okay if the degree of 2 to

854
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,520
J minus 3 to the B is not smooth so in

855
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,599
this case

856
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,060
we can use the following result to

857
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,099
recompute data surgery

858
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,380
so we assume assume that the generalized

859
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,680
Roman hypothesis holds then we have e

860
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,940
start which is like these super singular

861
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,900
elliptic curve

862
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,900
that we we have in the protocol and then

863
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,579
let's assume that we have additional

864
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,700
information additional data which is a

865
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,740
description of the the basis of the

866
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,859
endomorphism Ring of start then there

867
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,780
exists the polynomial time algorithm

868
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,420
that finds an exogenify extra which is

869
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,859
the surgeon that actually we need

870
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:11,520
between e extra and a star and the

871
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,380
degree of this estrogen Phi x-ray is

872
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,119
actually the degree that we need we need

873
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,940
then we can launch the attack the high

874
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,380
level overview of the attack that have

875
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,300
described like in the previous slides

876
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,760
which means that we have description of

877
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,220
Phi extra and also from this description

878
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,339
we can actually retrieve the Dual of the

879
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,079
secret searching for bulb which is

880
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,240
equivalent to the exogenic fiber itself

881
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,760
okay so that's all from me thanks for

882
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,570
your attention

883
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:46,979
[Applause]

884
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,040
thanks a lot if there are any questions

885
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,079
again please come to the front and ask

886
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,660
your question in the mic Maybe

887
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,520
I can kick off with exactly the same

888
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,180
question to the other expert on isogenes

889
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,660
so how do you see the future of isogeny

890
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,420
based cryptography

891
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,880
um well that's a good question I think

892
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,740
that the future is really interesting I

893
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,180
think that there will be main

894
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,520
applications of the of this kind of

895
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,380
attack so maybe we can use higher

896
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,240
dimensional misogynist to construct new

897
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,640
protocols and maybe also Advanced

898
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,280
protocols rather than just key exchanges

899
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,700
or PK maybe other Advanced Primitives so

900
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,420
that's one of the venues and yeah I

901
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,180
think there's as Thomas said the

902
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,520
resource there's already work using this

903
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,980
kind of attack which is like a variant

904
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,800
of ski sign which is the the signature

905
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
scheme at the moment for for

906
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,180
shogenic-based cryptography so yeah I

907
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,919
think that the future could be bright

908
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,660
okay it sounds promising

909
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,560
any other questions

910
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,150
no then let's thank the speaker again

911
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:06,080
[Applause]

912
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,400
good so now we come to the last

913
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,520
presentation in this session first

914
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,920
session on isogenes so we went from and

915
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,280
two practical attacks

916
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,119
um yeah we've shown how to break sidh

917
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,920
but of course as you saw from the two

918
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,300
previous talks

919
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,760
um there were still super exponential

920
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,980
so now we come to the to the third and

921
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,079
last presentation in the session where

922
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,060
it is shown how to break sidh in

923
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,500
polynomial time

924
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,960
and the presenter is Damian Robert so

925
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,540
Damia please go ahead okay thank you in

926
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,920
Japan let me stand this okay so uh I'm

927
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,200
sure you're all tired about hearing

928
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
about breaking his idh so I'm sorry

929
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,599
about that uh so Thomas was complaining

930
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,579
that an earlier version of the slides

931
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,700
did not have enough memes so I put more

932
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,619
memes in it so hopefully you'll find

933
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:02,940
them funny

934
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,820
uh so I'm going to talk about working as

935
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,520
ADH in polynomial time so the difference

936
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,740
between the two players the main

937
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,180
difference with the two previous

938
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,700
presentation is that the attack will

939
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,859
apply Heaven if we don't know the

940
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,740
morphism and also the attack is not

941
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,260
heuristic does not rely on Jared it's

942
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
completely proven

943
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,820
but first i'm actually completely going

944
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,560
to forget about inside the edge because

945
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm going to want to work with a

946
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,599
marginalized context and the context is

947
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,380
about isogenes so we have an isogeny

948
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,540
between two ethic curves I'm going to

949
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,180
raise the same notation Phi is going to

950
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,940
be an anisogyny which simply means the

951
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,599
degree is n and the network question is

952
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,480
to evaluate file on point so whenever

953
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,000
nitrogen you want to evaluate it are we

954
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,619
going to call that the evaluation

955
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,380
problem and that's what we want to do

956
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,920
so when we have a way to evaluate an

957
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,500
isogeny we can ask about the reverse

958
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,660
problem meaning that we have an

959
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,480
isogeneous we have some image and from

960
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,880
these I made we want to reconstruct the

961
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,960
isogenes

962
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,760
so I'm going to call that the

963
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,099
interpolation problem now you'll see why

964
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,560
in a moment and more precisely it

965
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,940
defines the NN parameter position

966
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,359
problem when I have an isogeny the image

967
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,839
of this isogenium on the basis of the N

968
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,880
Prime torsion so I would like only in

969
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,560
one point of endpoint version but for

970
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,200
technical reason I need the basis and I

971
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,940
want to work on stock design which means

972
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,680
being able to evaluate it on any other

973
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,880
point

974
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,720
so coming back to sidh the key exchange

975
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,500
itself was using the evaluation problems

976
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,720
namely the two to the A and three to the

977
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,540
B evaluation problems and since the

978
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,760
protocol did publish the image of some

979
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,859
points breaking sidh as Luciano said is

980
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,299
wait in this settings called ssites

981
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,300
we're used to working solving the

982
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,400
interpolation problem

983
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,940
so let's first

984
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,760
yeah so the lesson that we have is that

985
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,440
if you have a collection protocol which

986
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,020
use torsion point it's actually a bad ID

987
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,839
so don't do that

988
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:22,980
so let's go back to Evolution versus

989
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,740
interpolation in the general case so we

990
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,980
have an isogeny and concretely xyzogenes

991
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,220
given by a rational function G over H

992
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,160
was a degree is more or less n so

993
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,320
evaluating the isogene on the point is

994
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,180
simply evaluating the rational function

995
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,800
we have explicit formula from the

996
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,859
rational function due to value and coel

997
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,500
and so the ovulation is linear it takes

998
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,940
o of n

999
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,579
uh and so what is interpolation well

1000
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,619
it's really an interpolation of rational

1001
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,599
function because we have the image of a

1002
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,359
point say P1 we have the group launch

1003
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,400
analytical so we also have the image of

1004
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,579
2p1 three prior one and so on and if you

1005
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,859
have NOS image it's a simple rational

1006
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,599
function or construction and we can

1007
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,780
reconstruct the isogeneous time using

1008
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,760
fast algorithms

1009
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,720
so evaluation on interpolation is linear

1010
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,960
time in general but to do a key exchange

1011
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,940
or attack things we don't want linear

1012
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,760
time we want logout in time because n is

1013
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,339
going to be 2 to the power will be a big

1014
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,540
problem

1015
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,020
and in some cases we have a much faster

1016
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,300
way to evaluate an isogeneous namely

1017
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,760
when n is smooth we can decompose it

1018
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,920
into a product or small isogenes

1019
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,619
evaluate each of these small isogenes

1020
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,400
and then we get an evolution which is

1021
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,800
logarithmet time and so the question is

1022
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,560
can we also have interpolation that

1023
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,520
could be also of logarithmic time

1024
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,500
but trust I'm still going to speak about

1025
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,260
evaluation because there's one specific

1026
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,400
case where evaluation is fast even when

1027
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,060
n is not smooth namely if you look at

1028
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,280
the isogenic event by multiplication by

1029
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,400
L so we are back to standard electrical

1030
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,460
cryptography you all know that even if L

1031
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,980
is a prime number so the degrees L

1032
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,500
square is not at all smooth we can still

1033
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,660
evaluate scalar multiplication in

1034
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,660
overflow L and in this slide I want to

1035
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,640
reinterpret the double known algorithm

1036
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,339
so one way to interpret it which is was

1037
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,260
node ready to reman and maybe even

1038
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,540
before him is that the double and add

1039
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,880
algorithm is can actually be interpreted

1040
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,119
as an isogeneous in dimension two so

1041
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,319
already when you're doing the

1042
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,380
development are actually doing isogenic

1043
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,900
Dimension too namely if you look at this

1044
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,960
Matrix Phi which is given by 1 1 minus 1

1045
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,800
1 so it means that on point P1 p2m the

1046
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,079
sermon the difference these metrics

1047
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,119
encode the doubling and the addition of

1048
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,280
the double and add algorithm so one way

1049
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,500
to reinterpret the development is that

1050
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,940
the double anal algorithm is a

1051
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,540
composition of log of L isogenes which

1052
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,359
are smaller gazogeneous but in dimension

1053
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,180
two so somehow we embedded or scalar

1054
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,640
multiplication into a product of small

1055
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,520
degreesogenes in dimension 2.

1056
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,980
so this is an interesting idea and we

1057
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,839
would like to use this ID not only for

1058
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,300
evaluation but for interpolation and

1059
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,040
this is where I'm going to cite candy

1060
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,560
Slimmer so this is the only technical

1061
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,920
slide and for technical reason I'm going

1062
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,839
to need to extend conditioner which was

1063
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,180
stated phalactic curves to arbitrary

1064
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,359
average

1065
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,180
Dimension and this assumption is very

1066
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,040
simple you take the same proof and

1067
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,440
challenge electrical vibrant writing and

1068
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,119
still works the same so it's very easy

1069
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,579
to extend it Slimmer and essentially

1070
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:53,220
what it says the Slimmer is that if you

1071
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,079
have some isogenes in a commutative

1072
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,660
diagram you can combine them in a matrix

1073
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,400
it's still a two by two Matrix so if you

1074
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,740
look at my Matrix file it's exactly the

1075
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,020
same type of Matrix I had before for the

1076
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,940
double on N it's just a bit more General

1077
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,700
and the magical thing about this metric

1078
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,980
is that it gives an isogene in dimension

1079
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,440
2 which is an A plus b isogen so as

1080
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,960
Thomas said we don't have a product of

1081
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,400
degree like we would if we were foreign

1082
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,540
which is a

1083
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,099
somewhat magical

1084
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,380
so in summary one way to interpret

1085
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,000
kanislima is like some soft

1086
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,980
generalization of the double and other

1087
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,780
great generalization where we use more

1088
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,720
General isogenes

1089
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,599
okay so how can we use this Lima for the

1090
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,579
interpolation problem

1091
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,460
well we have an isogeneous files that we

1092
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,740
want to reconstruct and so we only need

1093
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,960
to find an auxiliary isogeneous so my

1094
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,819
Alpha here was what was called Phi extra

1095
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,040
before

1096
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,400
an axial isogeny which is so what we

1097
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,160
want to do is to web class or isogenify

1098
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,619
by which is an anisogyny by another

1099
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:01,440
hydrogeny which is an antibisogynist and

1100
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,420
Kenny Slimmer allow me to do that if I

1101
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,460
can construct an estrogen of degree M

1102
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,400
where m is n Prime minus n

1103
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,359
Dimension 2 so by assumption I know the

1104
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,280
image of the end Prime Direction I know

1105
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,260
Alpha so I can know also the image of

1106
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,420
iPhones and Prime torsion on the 10

1107
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,760
North Circle the canal of a big file and

1108
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,560
when there is a kind of big fire can

1109
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,619
evaluate it on any point and since 5 on

1110
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,200
beds modify I can work over a small file

1111
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,440
on any point that's the basic ID and the

1112
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,079
evaluation is fast if n Prime is smooth

1113
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,200
which is the case for sidh

1114
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,780
so some example of constructing Alpha

1115
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,420
which are already seen is if m is smooth

1116
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,119
you look for I5 product a small degree

1117
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,440
is a journey

1118
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,900
if m is L Square you can take another

1119
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,700
Murphy's which is simply the

1120
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,480
multiplication by L and marginally if

1121
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,700
your nose on the Murphy's Wing you can

1122
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,680
combine this on the Mafi to construct an

1123
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,960
exogeny of the correct degree as Luciano

1124
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,260
showed

1125
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,160
already

1126
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,640
it's already a bad five side edge when

1127
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,740
using a other merchandisogyny but it's

1128
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,560
not a polynomial attack yet foreign

1129
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,220
and remember that I want to work on the

1130
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,140
general case so I don't even want to

1131
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,940
assume that I'm over a financial field

1132
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,560
so maybe I don't have any of them office

1133
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,200
at all but that's not quite true even if

1134
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,760
I don't have any other movies I still

1135
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,099
have the scalar multiplication and if I

1136
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,200
have the scalar multiplication maybe I

1137
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,780
can use them somehow and we already went

1138
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,420
to IR Dimensions so maybe I can go to

1139
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,099
have a higher Dimension to combine

1140
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,500
scalar multiplication and that's exactly

1141
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,240
what I'm going to do

1142
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,339
is that even if I have only the scalar

1143
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,099
multiplication on E if I look at e

1144
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,500
Square I can build on the Murphys of

1145
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Norm sum of two square

1146
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,900
which is uh you can see that as a brand

1147
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,240
of candies it's simply looking at

1148
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,839
complex integers and

1149
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,540
a number is widely a square but it's

1150
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,160
much more frequent to be a sum of two

1151
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,619
squares but not every integer sum of two

1152
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,060
squares so we need to go ahead and

1153
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,980
higher and what is two is that every

1154
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,740
integrate the sum of four square and if

1155
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,540
it's we have some and it's easy to find

1156
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,060
this decomposition and if you have this

1157
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,400
decomposition we can build a big four by

1158
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,040
four Matrix which is of Norm m

1159
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,400
so on e to the 4 I have all the random

1160
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,619
office I need maybe not an ear neither

1161
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,720
integers but e to the four I always have

1162
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,819
always on the Murphys I need and that's

1163
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:40,920
enough to launch the attack except that

1164
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,980
this time my big file would be nitrogeny

1165
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,140
from E1 to the fourth and E2 to the

1166
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,000
fourth to E1 to the fourth times two to

1167
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,540
the four so now I'm in dimension eight

1168
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,960
and this General case it was already

1169
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,460
known it's something called design

1170
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,660
strike

1171
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,500
so in summary if I combine candy Slimmer

1172
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,500
and downwind streak what I get is what I

1173
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,180
call it's a stupid name but I call it

1174
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,520
the embedding Lemma which essentially

1175
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,619
says

1176
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,440
it also applies for any ability not only

1177
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,140
electric curve but its resources says

1178
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,680
that when you have an anisogyny for any

1179
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,680
n Prime which is greater than n so any n

1180
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,520
Prime not only the multiple of n but any

1181
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,940
n Prime you can embed the isogen E5 into

1182
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,579
a bigger isogeneous which is of degree n

1183
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:35,640
Prime but in higher Dimension so always

1184
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,460
in dimension 8G and sometimes Dimension

1185
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,140
4G and 2G

1186
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,540
so this being consider considerable

1187
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,660
flexibility at the cost of going up in

1188
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,740
dimension

1189
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,500
so we if we think about it from the

1190
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,240
cryptographic point of view what this

1191
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,220
does is that it reduces the

1192
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,500
interpolation problem to the end Prime

1193
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,380
evaluation problem in IR Dimension so we

1194
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,480
have a reduction and if n Prime is

1195
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,960
smooth this reduction is we can we can

1196
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,900
evaluate it and then Prime isogenes and

1197
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,599
actually I don't need n Prime quarters

1198
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,700
and n it already works if we only have

1199
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,160
in point square that has an N I want to

1200
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,000
explain why but it used dual exogenes

1201
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,500
so as I said this solves interperson

1202
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,780
problem and Prime is plasmus and it's a

1203
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,880
very general Lemma it's not applies not

1204
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,940
only for sidh and as I said the amazing

1205
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,460
fact is that it works even if any n is

1206
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,819
prime so for sidh and it was smooth it

1207
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,099
was 2 to the air 3 to the B but this

1208
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,720
General version works even if any

1209
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,660
experiment this has applications so the

1210
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,579
first application which we saw is that

1211
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,040
the competitive wax acid Edge but it

1212
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,740
also have constructed applications

1213
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,859
so just to set a few examples we can use

1214
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,540
that to get an efficient open notation

1215
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,940
of any isogeny we can use it to compute

1216
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,339
ordinary on the Murphy's ring canonical

1217
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:58,619
lift we can use it for Point continuing

1218
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,180
Computing modular polynomial class

1219
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,400
polynomials you've heard about caching

1220
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,740
in any other dimensions so there's a lot

1221
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,900
of constructive applications so no

1222
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,420
higher dimensional isogenes are going to

1223
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,740
be everywhere in cryptographics

1224
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,319
so I have a few minutes still so I spent

1225
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,540
this minute to expand a bit about

1226
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,520
Computing exogeny in higher Dimension

1227
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,079
because I said we can reduce

1228
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,579
Dimension but can we actually do that

1229
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,680
can we compute hydrogen in the transfer

1230
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,380
in dimension eight and the answer is yes

1231
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,660
this is a problem I spent a lot of time

1232
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,559
working on mainly with David lubix and

1233
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,319
yeah more than a decade and what we

1234
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,819
managed to prove it took a lot of work

1235
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,619
but what we managed to prove is that an

1236
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,740
anisogyny Dimension G can be computed in

1237
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,900
linear time which means linear time in

1238
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,700
the degree in the size of the canal

1239
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,559
which is n to the G

1240
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,099
so for Dimension One vegetation was O of

1241
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,140
N and now we have algorithm which is in

1242
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,240
O of n to the G which is the size of the

1243
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,260
kernel

1244
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,960
uh there is a caveat that we're using

1245
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,579
something which is called Theta

1246
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:08,700
functions which work on any variety but

1247
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,640
the big whole eyed constant depending on

1248
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,240
G which is exponential in G so

1249
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,099
um the number of theta coordinates we

1250
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,200
need to use it two to the G or four to

1251
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,020
the G so of course 8 to the eight is

1252
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,059
already quite expensive as you'll see

1253
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,380
soon

1254
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,140
so in the special case where zabian

1255
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,940
varieties the Jacobian so can be

1256
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,339
described with a curve

1257
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:33,900
I have a much more compact

1258
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,700
representation because the curve is of

1259
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,859
Dimension one and we have an agree to

1260
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:39,720
compute the journey on Jacobian due to

1261
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,480
Covenant Azon which is also linear and

1262
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,579
we takes on to product the problem with

1263
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:48,180
that is that it doesn't uh genetically

1264
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,940
starting with Dimension 4 and IBM YT

1265
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,680
will not be a product of Jacobian it

1266
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,420
only works for Dimension one two and

1267
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,760
three and here for the attack from the

1268
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,579
application in dimension Forum 8 so I

1269
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,040
cannot rely on jacobians I need an

1270
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,839
algorithm work on all leveling varieties

1271
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,119
and for another one I know use data

1272
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,020
function also this exponential C and G

1273
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,559
so what can we expect

1274
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,020
to compute an L to the e isogen e while

1275
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,960
we decompose it as e times l isogeneous

1276
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,540
so e times o of L to the G but as I said

1277
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,280
the constant in the Big O we lie

1278
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,500
something corresponding to the dimension

1279
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,140
so what we can expect some constant

1280
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,780
times 2 to the G which is the number of

1281
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,660
theta coordinates times L to the G which

1282
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,359
is the size of the canal times one plus

1283
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,339
G because when we decompose is routine

1284
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:40,260
we have some points to push to get our

1285
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,280
kernels

1286
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,920
and if you look at the name ratio it

1287
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,440
goes up very fast compared to Dimension

1288
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,559
One if we look at the existing algorithm

1289
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,640
to attack psych this is some estimate on

1290
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,859
the number of field operation we need to

1291
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,500
Backside for an arbitrary starting curve

1292
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,780
with different security parameters

1293
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,280
and if you look at the associate system

1294
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,520
of precise estimation as you can see

1295
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,400
it's the estimated what shows are

1296
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,020
actually a bit better than the neighbor

1297
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,300
sure it's because the image of a point

1298
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,180
is once you've computed the image the

1299
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,640
isogenes of anxiety Computing image is

1300
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,980
faster than the naive estimate

1301
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,859
and this is the current state of the art

1302
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:29,160
but to be fair until the attack I didn't

1303
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,380
think a lot about Diamond transfer I was

1304
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,900
many interesting Dimension too and so I

1305
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,760
hope to improve the formula for

1306
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
dimension for I have some idea to do

1307
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,220
that

1308
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,920
but the constant of the hair the heart

1309
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,599
is that the estimated ratio is that

1310
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,760
Dimension 2 should be worsely five times

1311
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,579
slower than Dimension one dimension 4

1312
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:51,000
was the 100 times slower and dimension 8

1313
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,520
the weight is aware like thirty thousand

1314
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,980
even if you can hope to improve it it's

1315
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,440
still going to be slow but for an attack

1316
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,359
it's not a problem because uh

1317
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:07,319
so it's going to bike sidh

1318
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:09,859
so time for conclusion

1319
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:12,720
unfortunately it's time for the psych

1320
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,900
protocol to go but we can hold I think

1321
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,880
it's all the isogenic community can say

1322
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,960
it was a motivating it was a very

1323
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,359
automatic protocol to work on and it led

1324
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:25,940
to a lot of

1325
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,940
useful cryptography and so rather than

1326
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,160
being sad I think we should visualize so

1327
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,058
this is the last

1328
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,860
laughs So yeah thank you

1329
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:47,849
[Applause]

1330
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,880
thanks for Damia so again if there are

1331
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,980
questions please come to the front of

1332
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,540
the microphone to ask them

1333
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,980
so you said that there are some

1334
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,300
constructive applications for

1335
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,700
constructing and the morph Computing and

1336
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,720
the Murphy's rings of so of a billion

1337
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,440
varieties of any Dimension yes or and if

1338
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,160
so how ah so only for ordinary so for

1339
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,760
ordinary ellipticals and I can extend

1340
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,680
that for denial and varieties adhesives

1341
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,660
I can it's a bit technical but the idea

1342
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,720
for elliptic curve is that you can use

1343
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,960
this kind of embedding Lemma to when you

1344
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,300
know an isogeneous you can use this to

1345
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,700
divide it by any integer and still

1346
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,740
compute the diversion normally when you

1347
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,599
divide it you need to take an extension

1348
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,339
to complete the image of a point where

1349
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,859
but with this kind of technical we can

1350
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,359
divide by a large integer without uh if

1351
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,819
we divide by and take care of size l

1352
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:56,160
normally you need some scene which is

1353
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,319
bringing L which is kind of technical we

1354
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,400
can do that with something which is

1355
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,680
logarithic in L so we have a polynomial

1356
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,859
algorithm to compute ordinary

1357
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:07,140
so I have a paper on it if you know I

1358
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,220
can send it to a reference

1359
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:15,078
thanks a lot any other questions

1360
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,020
if not then let's think Damian first uh

1361
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,640
it's more of a comment so the ramp

1362
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,740
session deadline is in 20 minutes so

1363
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,839
please submit and

1364
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,059
that's as I said

1365
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,300
great so indeed please

1366
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,500
be reminded that we have a dinner and of

1367
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,000
course the rum session so if you have

1368
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,740
anything to submit there

1369
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,359
are still time

1370
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,859
and with that yeah thank let's thank

1371
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:45,300
Damia and all the speakers in this

1372
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,420
session let's go for them

1373
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:56,300
[Applause]
