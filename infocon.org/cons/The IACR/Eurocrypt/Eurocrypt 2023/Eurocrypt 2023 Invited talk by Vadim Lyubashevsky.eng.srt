1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,220
okay good morning everybody welcome to

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,260
this first session of Wednesday

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,360
so it's our second invited speaker uh

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,880
vadimirsky

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,640
um so Vadim received his PhD in 2008

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,080
from UCSD not MIT after which he spent

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,820
two years as a postdoc at Tel Aviv

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,699
University already then vadim's main

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,560
area of research is quantum safe

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,000
cryptography based on the hardness of

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,980
lattice problems and at the time he

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,140
co-authored a letter based initial 3

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,559
submission namely Swift X and that

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,780
didn't have the best of Fate but

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,440
from 2010 to 2015 he was a researcher at

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,660
India in Paris and during that period he

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,820
introduced together with Chris beichel

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,100
and audreygov the celebrated ring LV

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
problem which is just one example of the

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,120
influential foundational work on

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,100
constructions of efficient cryptographic

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,899
Primitives including encryption digital

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,000
signatures and zero knowledge proofs

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,220
currently Vadim is a principal research

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,720
scientist in the cryptography group at

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,299
IBM research Europe in Suri and he was

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,640
awarded an ERC starting run in 2014 and

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,180
an ERC Consolidated Grant in 2020.

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,820
a lot of his designs have been used as

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,220
blueprints for submissions by many

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,960
various groups to the recently completed

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,520
nist post Quantum standardization

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,740
process and in fact he is part of the

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,840
Consortium of both schemes crystals

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,939
kyber and crystals dilithium which were

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,340
chosen as the primary standards

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,900
however there's still a lot of work to

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,700
be done from nist selections of those

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,799
two very basic Primitives to the

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,299
deployment of a rich lattice based

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,460
cryptographic ecosystem and with his

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,320
experience Fatima's ideally placed to

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,579
interpolate from what happened during

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,740
the standardization process to what

45
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,259
shooter could happen next and we are

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,720
very pleased he is here today so let's

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,399
give a warm round of Welcome to our

48
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,400
second invited speaker

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:03,119
[Applause]

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,399
okay thank you Martin thank you karmit

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,320
for inviting me it's really nice to be

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,758
here

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,199
um yeah so I'm going to talk a little

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,360
bit a little bit about the new

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,959
standardization process and more about

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,000
other random things yeah you actually

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,940
didn't put my updated title on there it

58
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,260
was more about musings about

59
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,239
cryptography bladder space cryptography

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,980
so it's a bit a little more informal

61
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,200
until maybe the end but let's see what

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,920
happens

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,020
so yeah I should talk a little bit about

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,060
in this pqc standardization this is

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,739
something that happened

66
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,480
um recently and a lot of people were

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
involved and this could affect the

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,400
future of cryptography so this is about

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,319
standardization of quantum safe crypto

70
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,700
so basic

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,980
um uh just chems and digital signatures

72
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,760
so it started in about 2015 when the NSA

73
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,900
said

74
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,459
well the US government should use

75
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,680
quantum safe crypto so they should if

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
you haven't switched to elliptic curves

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,180
uh they're Suite B don't wait for

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,280
elliptic wait for a Quantum safe crypto

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,260
but of course there was no standardized

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,080
Quantum safe crypto at that point so I

81
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,180
mean in the US the rules are the US

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,280
government has to use some standardized

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,379
things by nist so nist of course had to

84
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,780
then announce a competition for Quantum

85
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,480
safe chems and digital signature so this

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,819
is very similar to what they did for

87
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,500
Shah and AES so they had experience

88
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,300
running this this was a popular thing

89
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,280
for cryptographers to kind of congregate

90
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
in

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
and

92
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,180
um so they said let's do the same thing

93
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,620
for Quantum safe crypto of course there

94
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,819
was a bit of a difference here because

95
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,080
this was public keywords the other

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,700
surface symmetric key so things would be

97
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
a bit different and that's why they

98
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,780
expected several standards in each

99
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,780
category so Main and backups because you

100
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,220
know publicly crypto has to be based on

101
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,599
some mathematical assumptions and

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,640
quantum computers already broke some so

103
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,620
well let's let's have backups so in case

104
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,940
they break others

105
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,540
and um and so okay so they declared this

106
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,480
competition uh 69 total submissions

107
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,659
and uh five years later they selected

108
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,239
some initial standards uh it was a one

109
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,700
chem and three digital signatures

110
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,360
and um in about a year from now they

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,459
expect to have fully written standards

112
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,340
that people can implement

113
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,560
um so a question that is often asked I

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,418
mean the US it's not asked in the in

115
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,880
Europe and other places why do people

116
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,740
care about this standards this is a very

117
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,240
U.S Centric

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
um you know this doesn't nist only cares

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
about you know what the US government I

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,500
mean implements why why does the rest of

121
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,840
the world care and

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,360
um the reason is okay one is kind of

123
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,860
obvious well the US does a lot of

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,180
business with the rest of the world if

125
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,979
it has some standards others if they

126
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,919
want to kind of be

127
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,419
compliant or can communicate with the US

128
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,180
they should use the same things okay so

129
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,460
but the other one is that well this is

130
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,780
kind of arbitrary but this is what

131
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,000
happened that nist competitions have a

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
tradition of attracting a lot of

133
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,240
designers and crypt analysts and this is

134
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,340
what you want when you deploy new

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,320
cryptographic schemes you want some

136
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,120
place where all these people congregate

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,940
to and sort of eventually come up with

138
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,440
the best schemes and it could have been

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,759
anywhere you know it could be any other

140
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,680
government body that that kind of had

141
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,660
this reputation but somehow people said

142
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,880
well this nist has this reputation so

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
maybe this is where

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
um they will congregate

145
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,840
and um of course um another thing is

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,220
well you let's say you don't care about

147
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,139
what nist selects but still because

148
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,180
there's a lot of people fighting it out

149
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,979
maybe you don't want to pick what nist

150
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,720
chose but a lot of the other schemes

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,280
received a lot of attention too so maybe

152
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
you can pick those so it's also a good

153
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,080
place to get ideas for other other types

154
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,900
of schemes so what happened at nist

155
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,120
um so they chose one encryption scheme

156
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,759
chem so this was Kuiper and they chose

157
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,560
three digital signatures

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,139
um telethium Falcon and Sphinx so three

159
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,100
of the four are based on lattices

160
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,280
and sphinx is based on hash functions so

161
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,620
I'm not going to really explain I mean

162
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,539
maybe the idea was to explain the

163
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,039
schemes but I'm not going to do this I

164
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,139
mean it's been around for six years and

165
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,639
there's many many presentations online

166
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,320
describing them so if you haven't seen

167
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,580
them it's probably because you don't

168
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,620
care and like no there's nothing wrong

169
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,360
with it at all right but I don't want to

170
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,039
use the invited talk to talk about

171
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,600
things you don't care about

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,180
so okay so I'm not going to talk about

173
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,100
the schemes so let's see what what else

174
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,780
is happening

175
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,699
um well there's there's the belgians we

176
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,380
have to talk about the belgians I mean

177
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,759
they're used to winning all these

178
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,639
competitions with AES shot three and

179
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,560
then kind of during the nist thing kind

180
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,060
of started looking like they weren't

181
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,740
going to win it and so they went

182
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,720
completely berserks started breaking

183
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
everything so we had rainbow gone uh

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
psyche gone so at this point in this

185
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
kind of smartly stepped in and said okay

186
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,699
look it's not over we can we'll have

187
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,220
another round maybe you know maybe you

188
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,660
can win that one so in this actually

189
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,900
called for additional pqc signatures

190
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,860
um

191
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,560
and it is due in a month

192
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,919
it the official reason was that you know

193
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,780
they want some other assumption

194
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,240
structured lattices

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,740
um that have shorter signatures maybe

196
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,080
but you know I don't think that's the

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,819
real reason and well it stopped the

198
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,039
bloodbath for now so I think the this

199
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,800
has satisfied the belgians

200
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
um so then there's other government

201
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,039
agencies

202
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,840
um so like I said before

203
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,180
um for for one reason or another you

204
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,919
know nist uh maybe somebody does not

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,960
want to use in this standard

206
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,240
right and um

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
and that's okay

208
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,199
uh so other government agencies kind of

209
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,060
looked at this pool of candidates that

210
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,440
were submitted to nist and they said

211
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
well maybe we want to use something else

212
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,039
and um so two somewhat popular ones

213
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,599
um actually especially in France and

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,120
Germany in Europe is uh Frodo which is

215
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,039
based on slightly unstructured lattices

216
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,560
and I'll explain a little bit

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,840
um what this means and also mccaleese

218
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,000
which is a hidden copper code so it's a

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
code based scheme so my personal opinion

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
is oh so I have nothing I have no

221
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
problem with either of these this is a

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,099
perfectly fine thing I cannot justify to

223
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,780
anyone hey you know you should really

224
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,819
use kyber or if you want to use

225
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,199
something else it's perfectly fine I

226
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,360
have no there's no reason why you should

227
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,099
think that kyber is more secure than

228
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,599
something else

229
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
um the one thing that is a little bit

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,860
you know bothersome is how little

231
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,819
attention people pay to Quantum Crypt

232
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,259
analysis because the point for these

233
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,300
things is to be secure against Quantum

234
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,080
attacks and so mcalees for example it's

235
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,580
a code based scheme but it's you know

236
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,919
there's a hidden copper code in there

237
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,500
and I have no idea if any Quantum

238
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,419
algorithms person has looked at this

239
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,159
problem it's I mean of course this this

240
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,679
has been around since the 70s but

241
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,720
how how well studied has it been the

242
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,420
quantum World lattice is maybe a little

243
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,160
bit better because it kind of came from

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,200
the quantum World almost and now even

245
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,500
like um lwe is used to prove some

246
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,839
results that not nothing to do with

247
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,580
crypto just Quantum results that you can

248
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,920
verify Quantum circuits and somehow

249
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,899
based on lwe

250
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,040
um so there I think Quantum people

251
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,540
looking more into it still I wouldn't

252
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,580
say I'm super happy with the amount of

253
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,040
cryptanalysis going on there but at

254
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,899
least it's something so personally I

255
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,820
would trust you know if you want to

256
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,440
choose not choose the new standard photo

257
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,480
kind of makes sense so let me just

258
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
explain the difference between

259
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
structured and unstructured lattices

260
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,420
um so the learning with errors problem I

261
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,459
guess everyone knows

262
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:27,120
um

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,860
so it kind of looks like this you have

264
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,779
some random Matrix

265
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,459
um you know one two okay not super

266
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,920
random but it's random

267
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,980
um and then you uh you multiply it by uh

268
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,800
by a short Vector which is secret you

269
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
add a small error and you get a result

270
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,959
so I chose mod 10 but okay whatever it's

271
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,399
a different module so this is learning

272
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,680
with errors

273
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
um then there is ring learning with

274
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,220
theirs the only difference there is that

275
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,839
it works over an algebraic ring and the

276
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:55,920
way you think you should you can think

277
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,459
about is the Matrix is now structured so

278
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,040
um so the First Column Is Random

279
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,500
the second column is the rotation of the

280
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,080
First Column and then you negate the

281
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,140
first coefficient

282
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,779
and then the third column is the second

283
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,360
column rotated and you negate the first

284
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
the top coefficient again

285
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,620
okay so that's Ring lwe

286
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,180
and then there is something in the

287
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,700
middle which is like module lwe which is

288
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,860
a combination of you know kind of

289
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,839
something in between it's exactly that's

290
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,420
something in between uh where you kind

291
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,980
of break up your Matrix into little

292
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,320
quadrants for example and then you only

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
rotate within that quadrant so you have

294
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,380
the one five becomes five one nine eight

295
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,140
becomes two nine so things like that so

296
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,620
it's really just how the how the this

297
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,980
this initial random Matrix is structured

298
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,100
uh sorry so I said I will not teach you

299
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,720
about the schemes and I'm not trying to

300
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,339
trick you this is background for the

301
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,899
jokes

302
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,680
um so so then there's them later on so

303
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,519
there's the structured versus

304
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,959
unstructured lattices right so

305
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,000
structured lattices are the let's say

306
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,620
the the ones with the purple stuff the

307
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,300
unstructured one is the one at top on

308
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,700
top so the main thing about the main

309
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,839
difference

310
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,120
is that I mean the main advantage of

311
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,680
these structured things is that they

312
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,260
take less

313
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,899
bits let's say to represent and so

314
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,760
because the first one it's all random so

315
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,320
you have to you have this you have to

316
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,180
you need 16 numbers the second one well

317
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,500
from the First Column we can generate

318
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,760
the whole thing

319
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
okay so that's kind of the idea sort of

320
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,740
so there's the kyber and Frodo right so

321
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,640
you can use structured versus

322
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,620
unstructured of course you would prefer

323
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,360
for security unstructured the legs

324
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,700
structure the better but you have this

325
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,519
problem that well if it's structured it

326
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,260
can be much shorter so public key and

327
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,420
ciphertexts are about a kilobyte whereas

328
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,720
the unstructured is about 15 kilobytes

329
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,300
uh and but you know so is it worth it is

330
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,420
it worth in security wise and I don't

331
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,880
know maybe but you can you also always

332
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,920
have to think all right but look we

333
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,660
don't have to use the one kilobyte we

334
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,760
can increase its size to something else

335
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,740
we can use a much bigger lattice so

336
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,360
let's say for example if you increase it

337
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,700
to something like six kilobytes you have

338
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,980
about 1200 bits of security for a

339
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,980
structured lattice so is that better you

340
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,240
know you're still shorter than the

341
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
unstructured one but now you have 1200

342
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
bits of security

343
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
um I don't know right so the question is

344
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,540
will the new attacks if they ever exist

345
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,660
will they exploit the structure so this

346
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,519
algebraic structure is that the problem

347
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,399
if it is well then yeah unstructured is

348
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,839
better but of course the other thing

349
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,060
Could Happen what if new attacks are

350
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,100
against all lattices and currently this

351
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,480
is the state of the Ark and all the

352
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,839
attacks are generic

353
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,120
then maybe the right thing to have done

354
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,100
if you're worried about if you want

355
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,720
something stronger than what nist is

356
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,060
giving maybe you want to in love maybe

357
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,380
you want to have your own standard and

358
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,139
in large structured one right or maybe

359
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,220
you want to do something in the middle

360
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,720
right maybe you want to protect against

361
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
maybe you don't need 1200 bits of

362
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,860
security that's a bit ridiculous uh you

363
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,779
know we hope an algorithm doesn't take

364
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,180
it down to to nothing

365
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,079
um

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,579
and so maybe you want to combine both

367
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,860
right so since the structured one is so

368
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,839
small maybe just adding it just for how

369
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,899
to have the uh the 1200 you know the the

370
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,820
huge Dimension is something that's worth

371
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,880
it right so

372
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,800
these are these are questions that um

373
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,139
that one could ask and I haven't could

374
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,579
things that one could do and I haven't

375
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,160
seen these done by people who said we

376
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
don't want to use this standards we want

377
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,519
to go with something else but you know

378
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,920
you could do something in the middle for

379
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,260
example which also makes sense

380
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,540
so this is just um

381
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm not saying you should do it but this

382
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,920
is something that maybe I should one

383
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,620
could consider doing

384
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,839
all right so kind of the standardization

385
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,160
finished

386
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,620
but of course you know of course there

387
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,200
were attacks other schemes and then the

388
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,579
interesting part there's and of course

389
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,560
you have to I don't want to say

390
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
conspiracy theories but at least you

391
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,399
have to think about

392
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,440
could could something bad has happened

393
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,480
because you know there was the the

394
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,300
problem where the NSA tried not tried

395
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,060
inserted a back door into a random

396
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,459
number generator and kind of bribed the

397
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,740
company to use it and so there was a

398
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,300
problem there so so it is completely

399
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,540
normal to always ask questions you know

400
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,459
so the first thing I want to say is that

401
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,200
well it's not actually a back door is

402
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,079
not possible in this case because all

403
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,120
the public Randomness in these schemes

404
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,480
is generated from a prg like shot three

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,300
or shake so there's no there's no

406
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,360
possible way to put a back door in so

407
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,399
but if you're really still convinced

408
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,680
talk to the ketchup team that's where

409
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,180
the back door could be but they're

410
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,579
Belgian so please be careful

411
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,440
um so

412
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,240
um okay so but then you know you could

413
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,279
have but that's that's the kind of this

414
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,899
doesn't stop people from coming up with

415
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,420
more conspiracy theories so the only one

416
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,760
that sort of has been around

417
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,339
is that well this is a djb

418
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,920
he says well it's not hard to imagine

419
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,860
that the NSA has been working at this

420
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,899
before 2003 true I I hope they have been

421
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,699
um and uh that they're years ahead of

422
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,740
the public in finding attacks I don't

423
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,360
know

424
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,639
um and the last one is the one I yeah

425
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,680
it's probably false is that the NSA has

426
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,779
been pushing this to select algorithms

427
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,540
that NSA secretly knows how to break

428
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,800
so

429
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
so the problem is the same argument was

430
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,399
made uh when people didn't want to use

431
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,620
Liberty curve crypto

432
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,240
um and you could could make and this is

433
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,680
an argument you could have you could

434
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,620
make against anyone any scheme that that

435
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,740
NIS selected you could say exactly this

436
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,260
right but this is extremely unlikely and

437
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,199
dangerous right the because uh the these

438
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,480
are the algorithms that the NSA said the

439
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,959
US government itself must use so you

440
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,940
cannot base Security on the fact that no

441
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,800
one else will find the same algorithm so

442
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,019
this this I would completely discard

443
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,920
this um this this one you could think of

444
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,500
so I'm going to propose some which are

445
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,740
maybe a little bit better basically what

446
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,180
would I do if I were in charge of the

447
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,360
NSA and I wanted to kind of fix the fix

448
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,639
this competition

449
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,920
um it could no so the NSA could know

450
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,899
that a lower security parameter set is

451
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,459
broken so they I mean they have let's

452
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,079
say they have analyzed this for 20 years

453
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,839
they have better attacks so let's say

454
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,779
they can decrease security by 50 bids

455
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,699
right so what the NSA and they're pretty

456
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,560
sure that you know you can't do better

457
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,199
because they spent a lot of time on it

458
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,000
um kind of like with RSA for example

459
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,100
with factoring let's say the NSA is 20

460
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,019
years ahead and they discovered the

461
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,360
number field SIV before everyone else

462
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,579
okay so

463
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,699
um so this what NSA could do in this

464
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,699
case is only allow for the highest level

465
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,220
security level to be used and maybe they

466
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,019
hope that others use a lower security

467
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,500
level

468
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,240
um yeah maybe right then they can break

469
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,859
into devices that use the lower security

470
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,140
this is still I would say a bit

471
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,900
dangerous because the secrets could

472
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,640
still be valuable to American interests

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
right because if you say this kyber is

474
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,500
okay but only 256 bit somebody would say

475
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,040
well maybe 128 bit is okay too and

476
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,959
yeah

477
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,599
it's it's more likely that they're not

478
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,820
themselves using broken algorithms but

479
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,440
still a bit dangerous because others

480
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,600
especially in America would

481
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,580
you know would trust trust the US

482
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,860
government to kind of not give them

483
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,799
broken standards now a more likely thing

484
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
is why not you know a foreign government

485
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
tries to infiltrate in this competition

486
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
I mean this is open to everyone

487
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm not going to blame the belgians here

488
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,440
I start the jokes of stuff

489
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,900
um so um let's you know so let's say the

490
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,280
foreign intelligence has a secret break

491
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,620
to some widely known scheme it submits

492
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,299
the scheme and tries to get it standard

493
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,460
so there's no there's no fix they just

494
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,260
really try to try hard to get it

495
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,740
standardized and this is this there's no

496
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,600
reason why somebody wouldn't do

497
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,820
something like this right so it's a huge

498
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,340
win you know if it succeeds great

499
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,740
they're reading uh everyone's uh you

500
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,720
know everyone's email if it doesn't you

501
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,580
know if if it succeeds and somebody

502
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,100
finds an attack it's an embarrassment

503
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
um yeah this is what you should do if

504
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,039
you're a foreign government you should

505
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,679
you should do this

506
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,080
um now if you're the NSA on the other

507
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,240
hand this is what I would do

508
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,940
maybe maybe I would do this if I had to

509
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,160
do something this would be it I would I

510
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,740
would if I know an algorithm is uh is

511
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,480
broken and of course how do I know it's

512
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,940
broken because as as was said you know

513
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,620
it's been hard at work since 2003

514
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,059
they're ahead years ahead of the public

515
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,039
in finding a tax

516
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,620
so let's say I could break something

517
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,900
what I would do is I would tell nist to

518
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,539
push it as far as possible up

519
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,059
and then not select it

520
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,059
and then the hope is that others still

521
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,440
use the unselected final round

522
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,980
algorithms and you know the cherry on

523
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,360
top would be if they use them because

524
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,700
they don't trust nist in the NSA

525
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,820
right so this is still a bit dangerous

526
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,760
but I I mean the irony you got to do it

527
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,340
so

528
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,460
so this is really and so if you want to

529
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,260
think of a conspiracy theory so I mean

530
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,400
the second thing is a foreign government

531
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,780
that's not a conspiracy that's that's

532
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,640
just obvious something someone could do

533
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,559
it and the only attack against this is

534
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,039
script analysis but this one

535
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,140
right I mean you know I don't want to

536
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,880
take a poll who would do this who

537
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,780
wouldn't but uh

538
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,919
I'll admit I would uh

539
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,020
so but the reality you know it's fun to

540
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,700
think about but the reality is probably

541
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,760
very boring I mean it's as I said you

542
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,980
know as the quote said it's not hard to

543
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,539
imagine they've been working on this for

544
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,760
a very long time and now they're just

545
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,740
confident in lattice cryptography or

546
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,440
whatever it is so it's a bit of a downer

547
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,880
but

548
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,220
that's I would guess that's probably

549
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,200
what it is at least they're definitely

550
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
not using themselves schemes that are

551
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,260
broke

552
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,120
all right so some other things that

553
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
happened in um the competition that

554
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,620
maybe this could be a lesson for the

555
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,700
future

556
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,160
so

557
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,960
intellectual property so this is

558
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,020
something like I think it's Universal so

559
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,419
you know I was I was at some a bar just

560
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,039
talking to a person next to me and then

561
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,600
it normally becomes you'd start

562
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,039
discussing what would you do if you

563
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,320
could do anything and if I said nothing

564
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,059
I would do nothing I would just sit on a

565
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,400
beach and and it's like okay well maybe

566
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,500
a little more like okay fine I would

567
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,960
hike and I would I would write reviews

568
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,620
about things I use while my hikes so I

569
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,000
mean there was a bit of a disappointment

570
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,460
in my lack of ambition so then she said

571
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,960
come on but like anything I said all

572
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,539
right if I had unlimited funds I would

573
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,299
take down the IP industry and there

574
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,840
because and you know yeah okay and

575
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,379
yeah

576
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,820
and yeah so so it turns out she was an

577
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,500
engineer or a completely different field

578
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,140
a car company I was like yes yes that is

579
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,700
exactly you know we have we're stuck

580
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,799
with these uh you know we plug in a

581
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
cable and like is that patented is

582
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,760
plugging a cable into into the the

583
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,740
entertainment system a patent and and

584
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,080
sometimes it is or if you plug it in you

585
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,820
know and hold the button rather than

586
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,159
press a button is that and this is a

587
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,960
huge problem right so I mean the way it

588
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,299
works and I was very naive about this so

589
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,980
this is more of a kind of a lesson maybe

590
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,020
it's obvious to everyone but like to me

591
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,820
this is kind of new this was pretty new

592
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,500
so you know you have this prior work

593
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,299
some of it is obvious some of it is not

594
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,400
but it's whatever patented not patented

595
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,500
paper it doesn't matter so then you know

596
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,179
there's this prior work and then a

597
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,460
patent appears and it kind of you know

598
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,299
it's not exactly what the prior work is

599
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,919
uh but it's very close and you could

600
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,960
argue it's I mean it's kind of obvious

601
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,700
but it's not it got patented whatever

602
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,400
okay you know fine so don't do that

603
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,760
okay that so far it's not a huge issue

604
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,740
but then there's a product

605
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,860
that also is not exactly like the prior

606
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,620
work right but it's also very close and

607
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,940
kind of obvious

608
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,799
but then what somebody could do is say

609
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,840
oh but actually the product is really

610
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,820
close to the patent

611
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,679
and now you have to go ahead and prove

612
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,780
no all those blue circles are kind of

613
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,760
basically surrounding it there's there's

614
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,480
no way this patent is covering it

615
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,460
and now you have a fight right so this

616
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,280
is this is the problem for example

617
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,020
what happened

618
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,020
concrete example or hypothetical well no

619
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,600
it's concrete Okay so

620
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,700
so there was lwe learning with errors

621
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,100
right so this is you know if you

622
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,600
remember the slide I told you I'm not

623
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,860
trying to teach you anything this is

624
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,620
where this is where it's coming in

625
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
um so um you have that you had

626
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,400
encryption from learning with errors

627
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
with small Secrets no problem so it all

628
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,860
existed nobody's contesting it's um it's

629
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,820
sort of a novelty or whatever

630
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,659
um

631
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,640
and then there's ring LW so this is the

632
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
structured lwe

633
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,880
and um so we had the encryption and then

634
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,380
but you know you didn't have the

635
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,820
encryption with small Secrets because

636
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,400
it's kind of obvious but this became a

637
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,539
patent

638
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,900
okay fine

639
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,620
um

640
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,620
so it does look kind you know if you do

641
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,360
the same or something with the top you

642
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,740
could do the same thing with the bottom

643
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,400
why is it a patent well the the the

644
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,500
argument was well because it's Rings

645
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,200
because it's a ring thing and not a

646
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
matrix you can now multiply com you know

647
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,640
you can do commutative multiplication

648
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,159
it's like okay but you don't have to do

649
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,620
it but you could but you know but why

650
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,960
okay anyway so this was this was a pet

651
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,240
okay fine no problem

652
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,520
um then came modulus the thing in the

653
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,740
middle they showed you right and then so

654
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,960
we had so kyber is encryption for

655
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,659
modularly with small Secrets right so it

656
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,059
was it's the bottom one

657
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,520
so now the question is

658
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,900
well

659
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,020
I mean why does it come why is it

660
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,240
derived from the bottom from the middle

661
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,640
one rather than from the top one I mean

662
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,900
they're

663
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,760
if anything now you don't even have this

664
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,679
commutativity so there's nothing to do

665
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,900
you know there's nothing uh

666
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,659
really that you need from the second one

667
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,000
and so when you know this kind of came

668
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,100
up and I thought well okay I mean this

669
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,080
this is probably obviously like lawyers

670
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,520
involved here so this is just a

671
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
misunderstanding and you know if I just

672
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,559
explain it to everyone this this will be

673
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,360
cleared up no problems you know just

674
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,799
just you know there's no malicious

675
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,539
intent just really a misunderstanding

676
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,000
and it was a misunderstanding

677
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,100
right but the misunderstanding was not

678
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,620
on their part it was on my part

679
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,500
so you know here's a I think everyone

680
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,960
understands what's going on here so this

681
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,580
is kind of how obvious it was to

682
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,520
everyone else except me and maybe Damian

683
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,400
who also spent a lot of time you know

684
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,500
clearing up these misunderstandings by

685
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,659
uh yeah so you know here we all know

686
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,700
what's going on except maybe the clerk

687
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,440
who says well okay

688
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,539
um I see what's happening there's a

689
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,460
person who's asking for money we are a

690
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,200
bank we do deposits and withdrawals

691
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,240
nothing out of the ordinary except for

692
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,559
the you know for the hands up I don't

693
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,179
know why that's necessary so okay so

694
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,679
just give me your your account number

695
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,659
and ID and you know we will

696
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,140
so but you know he's not so he's really

697
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,360
misunderstanding the situation

698
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
even though you know money is something

699
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,580
they have so this is what this is

700
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,220
basically what happens in

701
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,279
in these cases right that

702
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,500
people just say look I will just extend

703
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,960
the patent and uh you know and then

704
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,159
we'll have a shootout and see what

705
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,299
happens

706
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,700
so yeah so really the misunderstanding

707
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,980
was on our side as to what's happening

708
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,539
so here are the other bad things that

709
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,400
could happen with a patent right so

710
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,779
everyone knows this like there's the

711
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,520
first degree trolling right you threaten

712
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,080
the frivolous lawsuit for using a

713
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
product I mean no one is I mean this is

714
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,460
not a surprise to everyone anyone

715
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,360
um

716
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
uh so but it's not even like filing one

717
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,260
it's threatening one right that's that's

718
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,419
the that's the bigger issue then there's

719
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,279
also um something that um

720
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,779
wasn't aware but okay I guess kind of

721
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,400
obvious as well there's also like this

722
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,039
second degree trolling so if you make a

723
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,900
product yourself and then you can

724
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,840
threaten that the that the some other

725
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,059
person who is possibly a first degree

726
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,740
troll has a patent on a competing

727
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,900
product and will sue you so really you

728
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
should be using you know my product

729
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,460
instead of some other one which could be

730
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,260
and this one even you know has some

731
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,740
bonus points attached to it because

732
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,440
um uh so first what you can do I mean

733
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
the the person may not even be a troll

734
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,860
right who you're threatening that will

735
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,840
sue you he may not even to be aware of

736
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,340
anything but

737
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,840
um but you could actually help him

738
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,700
expand his patents so these are that's

739
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,559
something else that can happen if you

740
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,539
file a patent somebody can even if you

741
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,039
didn't intend it maybe you had a very

742
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,140
good intentions but somebody could do

743
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,880
something like this and then they could

744
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,340
also act like actually their product is

745
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,860
saving the world from patents right

746
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,799
um so this is again bad things that can

747
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,419
happen another bad thing that can happen

748
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,000
is that completely unrelated parties get

749
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,100
involved and now it's not even science

750
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,640
and lawyers now it's government and so

751
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
actually this

752
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,620
fiber it kind of went to you know the

753
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,179
Department of State and I mean kind of

754
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,860
almost the white I think to the White

755
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,380
House level in the U.S to the to the lez

756
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,880
level in um

757
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,620
in France and they were not talking

758
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,080
about modular Liberty there right there

759
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,779
was now it's now it's part of a package

760
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,940
for for a nuclear submarines right so

761
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,400
now your patent is

762
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,140
and so you know there's the tweet from

763
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,360
the US government saying we thank we

764
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,340
thank the French for

765
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,559
their engagement I think maybe it's a

766
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,000
very carefully

767
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,620
worded tweet because they didn't really

768
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,299
thank them for contribution they just

769
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,100
thank them for their engagement

770
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,679
which okay it's true

771
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
but we applaud we are actually they

772
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,460
didn't think we applaud it's like well

773
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,700
done well

774
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,799
well played okay so it's maybe it's not

775
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,799
so bad uh maybe maybe yeah I didn't give

776
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,059
them enough credit

777
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,620
okay

778
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,279
um yeah but like there's no reason why

779
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,380
I mean you don't want unintended

780
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,380
consequences right so what can we do as

781
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,940
people who are not who don't have

782
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,760
unlimited funds to fight the IP thing so

783
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,580
all we can do is we can realize that

784
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,600
look

785
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,240
even in this situation it's hard you

786
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,340
know once the situation gets to to this

787
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,779
point it's really

788
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,460
I don't want to blame anyone for doing

789
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,260
something wrong in that situation you

790
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,179
know the lawyers have a job okay that's

791
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,520
their job the patent owners have an

792
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,140
incentive to let the lawyers do their

793
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,419
job the politicians they don't care they

794
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,039
have other problems and they said ah

795
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,960
this can be a pawn that we use let's use

796
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,500
it maybe you know so so there's it's

797
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,179
hard like if you just come into that

798
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,520
situation it's hard to blame anyone so I

799
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,960
think what you have to do is you have to

800
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
nip the situation in the bud and just

801
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,400
don't be tempted to create patents

802
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,299
and so something I do to not be tempted

803
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,980
is really for myself because sometimes

804
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,779
you are tempted right and if you

805
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,340
attempted the situation can get out of

806
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,559
control pretty fast so I just write in

807
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,779
the grant it's my goal to keep all work

808
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,399
funded by this project open source and

809
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,440
royalty free that's it so I if someone

810
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,880
says hey you should probably say no I

811
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,919
cannot I have this Grant and if I'm

812
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,559
tempted I say well I can't lie and it's

813
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't know it and I it I think it

814
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,279
works because there were times I was

815
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
like oh maybe I should but now it's

816
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,480
written I cannot right and even if you

817
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,059
work for a university it's not

818
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:48,659
um

819
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,940
it's not guaranteed that it will not be

820
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,799
used bad it would not be used for bad

821
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,840
purposes so

822
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,260
um there's an article by the eff on the

823
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,700
eff website that 15 American

824
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
universities formed a company that looks

825
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,820
like a patent troll so basically what

826
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,679
they do is they have patents

827
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,899
and which are not very useful because

828
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,840
they couldn't get any startup to start

829
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,700
up with it so they said okay look we're

830
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,380
just going to release it and any lawyer

831
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,240
that would like to use our patent to sue

832
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,580
someone else can do it

833
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,100
and we we just get some you know we just

834
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,539
get some kickbacks from it

835
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,399
yeah this is obviously not something you

836
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,279
want and so the one solution that you

837
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,779
know eff of course they will say

838
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,220
something like this is that when tax

839
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,260
payers fund research the fruits should

840
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,059
be available to all

841
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,820
think this is much closer to what I

842
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,980
believe than the current situation so

843
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,899
and I think we can do something about

844
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,080
this by just not filing patents okay

845
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,279
anyway

846
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,200
so now luckily all this this situation

847
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,520
has been resolved and we can move to

848
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,200
Quantum safe

849
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,659
all right so um so of course the this

850
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,419
all started with the NSA so the NSA said

851
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:58,320
um

852
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,659
okay we want Quantum safe algorithm so

853
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,640
they got Quantum safe algorithms so they

854
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,159
got they chose kyber dilithium and a few

855
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,779
some other ones that were already in

856
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,480
this standards just for software signing

857
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,919
and they only chose the highest security

858
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,080
level

859
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,360
um and then okay so everyone has chosen

860
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,640
something and now the question you often

861
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,320
get is when do I need to switch to

862
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,940
Quantum safe

863
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,740
so this is a very tough question

864
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,260
obviously because no one knows when

865
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,760
we'll have a quantum computer that can

866
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,620
break RSA in discrete lock right no one

867
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,360
knows you can of course make guesses and

868
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,740
give probabilities but these are not

869
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,740
useful right let's say there's a five

870
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,539
percent chance in seven years what do I

871
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,399
do do I have to calculate how much risk

872
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,260
I'm you know how much money I will lose

873
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,559
in five years if this is impossible

874
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,659
right so this is analysis paralysis and

875
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,220
this is why I actually like what the NSA

876
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,200
did they said

877
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
we don't care when the quantum computer

878
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,140
is coming this is where when you're

879
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,220
going to switch

880
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,500
so the US government must be completely

881
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,620
switched over by 2033 that's it right so

882
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,720
all the questions have stopped

883
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,200
and uh this is this is now the answer

884
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,659
so now people are working who care about

885
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,700
this they're working hard to try to get

886
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,539
everything switched over by 2033.

887
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,419
so it made everyone's life easier when

888
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,000
do I have to switch this is the timeline

889
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,700
all right so I think the

890
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,360
um

891
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,600
the kind of the simple algorithms are

892
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,580
basically done so we have encryption we

893
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,220
have digital signatures but now as we

894
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,039
know I think a lot of us here we We Now

895
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,419
work on zero knowledge in privacy

896
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:38,580
and you know zero knowledge is a really

897
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,679
amazing concept starting in the 80s but

898
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,299
but

899
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,399
trying to get zero knowledge and privacy

900
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,659
into practice

901
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,059
no luck right so of course it started

902
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,799
you know there was digital cash by xiaom

903
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,179
then there's I would say Anonymous

904
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,279
credentials the umbrella term for all

905
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,260
this privacy-based stuff and I don't

906
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,820
know what happened in the 80s and 90s I

907
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,380
wasn't around but you know when I came

908
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,100
to IBM in 2015 they were trying really

909
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,559
really hard to get these Anonymous

910
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,940
credentials where you can have this

911
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,500
digital ID and you can prove just

912
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,059
certain information and hide everything

913
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,039
else I mean it seemed like a great idea

914
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,200
and people they were trying very hard to

915
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,720
get it the technology was great and just

916
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,059
nothing I mean you just could not like

917
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,340
no one wanted to use it just there was

918
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,140
no application I don't know and so you

919
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,059
have this amazing concept zero knowledge

920
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,580
you had applications that use it which

921
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,580
made perfect sense it was fast it was

922
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,179
nothing right and so like just let me

923
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,679
just explain what Anonymous credentials

924
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,539
are um so you have some user you have an

925
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,159
issue and you're verifier it's a very

926
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,620
common sense thing so the user blind you

927
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,840
know sends blind it's a expand you know

928
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,519
extension of blind signatures so you

929
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,799
blind some credentials I know my age my

930
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,840
nationality to the issuer the issuer

931
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,580
signs these credentials without knowing

932
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,380
exactly what they are

933
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,360
and then the user can present to the

934
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,460
verifier any credential he wants right

935
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,460
so he can protect present I'm you know

936
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,980
my age my nationality so I'm American

937
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,080
and the fact that the issuer really

938
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,419
signed that I'm American and this and

939
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,520
hide everything else and even the issue

940
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,918
when he sees these things he cannot link

941
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,500
who is who is really the user that is

942
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,020
all he all anyone including the issue

943
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
knows about me is that I have this

944
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,179
credential C1 so so you know digital ID

945
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,739
you know beautiful lots of zero you know

946
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,020
and this is just one application

947
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,719
um there's tons tons of others nothing

948
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,399
really nothing Well enter Bitcoin

949
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,040
okay so

950
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,239
um still I mean still knows your

951
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,580
knowledge right so this then became the

952
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,199
argument of distributed versus

953
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,619
centralized currents okay so I I admit I

954
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,500
picked a particularly nonsensical quote

955
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,719
but a lot of them are similar right so

956
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,119
this one says look Bitcoin allows you to

957
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,739
plan for the future and you don't have

958
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:55,139
to worry about bankers and smoke-filled

959
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,420
rooms somewhere and you know with

960
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,339
deflationary money everything will be

961
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,380
cheaper not more expensive it sounds

962
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,180
amazing you know deflation why haven't

963
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,220
we thought of deflation

964
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,580
um okay this is nonsense right but a lot

965
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,800
of it was

966
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,140
a lot of the you know the

967
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,359
Arguments for decentralized currency

968
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,579
distributed currency are similar right

969
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,680
we're taking away the power from someone

970
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,359
else

971
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,460
but there's no but giving it to who

972
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,060
right so I I my my view is that a

973
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,440
decentralized system will eventually

974
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,720
become ordered right if you if there's a

975
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,040
power vacuum

976
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,800
somebody will step in so just an example

977
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,300
right

978
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,579
um you know does anyone believe that you

979
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,560
know you had Bitcoin okay fine great but

980
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
then this this huge currents you know

981
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,359
cryptocurrency net you know Network

982
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,760
formed around it and now people are

983
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,380
inserting money into Bitcoin right does

984
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,119
anyone believe that stable coins are 100

985
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,220
backed by Fiat no I don't think so I

986
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,560
don't think anyone believes that but and

987
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,260
then they are creating money right just

988
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,320
like you know so these are the people

989
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,760
that uh that are

990
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,760
you know that are now the faceless

991
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,800
Bankers in a smoke-filled room and

992
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,359
actually I think right now we don't have

993
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,520
faceless bankers at least in democracy

994
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
we actually know who they are now they

995
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
really are faceless something right but

996
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,180
so but this you know self-delusion must

997
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,980
continue or else the whole system falls

998
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,920
apart right so I really don't think that

999
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,359
I think the bigger issue here is that

1000
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,339
technology cannot replace law the only

1001
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,440
thing if you don't like the system you

1002
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,599
have to change the law if you just rely

1003
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,240
on technology somebody will take

1004
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,220
advantage of it much more than you would

1005
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,380
right it's okay so then what so still

1006
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,060
there's no zero knowledge so what

1007
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,280
happened well there's another brilliant

1008
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,839
idea so let's allow the powerful parties

1009
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,359
to be anonymous that's what Bitcoin does

1010
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,780
and to hide everything that they do

1011
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,079
right so this is now the idea where zero

1012
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,460
knowledge can help

1013
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,119
and this okay

1014
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,000
like I'm very happy that zero knowledge

1015
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,579
Goods get used

1016
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,820
right but

1017
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,119
you know not for this right this is but

1018
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,700
you know it became big right this is you

1019
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,320
know privacy-based cryptocurrency right

1020
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,599
it's it's it got everyone's attention

1021
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,520
right it's exciting it's it's

1022
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,099
controversial it's full of ethical

1023
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,579
questions right and like to me this is

1024
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,260
this you know when somebody cannot get

1025
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,260
attention and does this this is like you

1026
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,119
know this is zero knowledge makes a sex

1027
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,640
tape right this is

1028
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,180
um

1029
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,180
this was the moment and but you know

1030
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,520
what it worked

1031
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,280
it always works right now central banks

1032
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,460
see this and the the the

1033
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,619
um the applications that we had before

1034
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,380
that we could not that nobody wanted to

1035
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,020
use now saying actually this is what we

1036
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,040
want

1037
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,920
and okay great so

1038
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,079
it makes me very happy and and this is

1039
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,339
this is why I also think that

1040
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,320
complaining about cryptocurrency you

1041
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,579
know so

1042
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,619
maybe what I was doing two minutes ago

1043
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,320
is pointless right you say Bitcoin uses

1044
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,060
more energy than Finland you know crypto

1045
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,859
allows for anonymous dark markets you

1046
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,480
know it's intrinsically worthless value

1047
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,160
going to zero

1048
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,980
and yeah okay but you can counter every

1049
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,960
argument you know Finland let's cut

1050
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,760
Finland Off the Grid you know and then

1051
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,800
we yeah

1052
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,260
I you know there's so many people

1053
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,880
without power what's six million more

1054
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,720
it's um you know saying X is bad is a

1055
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,820
very hard argument to win when X has a

1056
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,200
very loyal following and makes people

1057
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,660
money right so for example this is not

1058
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,359
not a nice example so all we allow a big

1059
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,579
argument for Pro for pro-gun people in

1060
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,079
the U.S was well you know if you're

1061
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,180
going to ban guns you should ban cars

1062
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,040
too because they kill more people well

1063
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,160
not anymore right so and still nothing

1064
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,020
is going to happen

1065
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,579
right

1066
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,020
um and you know being intrinsically

1067
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,540
worthless you know ah you know it's

1068
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,480
gonna go to zero will it I mean you know

1069
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,640
we had these are these uh yeah there was

1070
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,859
the nfts right that was pretty big you

1071
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,720
know you had these monkeys or apes or

1072
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Apes uh and they were poor I don't even

1073
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,339
remember what it was people said this is

1074
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,339
so stupid you know digital art you know

1075
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:20,160
it makes no sense you know okay but if

1076
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,119
you're gonna make an argument that

1077
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,500
because something is stupid it's going

1078
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,060
to go to zero you have to make that

1079
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,260
about everything but you know you know

1080
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,640
what else is stupid you know like real

1081
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,300
art right so I mean not because it's

1082
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,359
pretty right but not pretty but you know

1083
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,800
like you have an argument about

1084
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,599
something but then you let's say you

1085
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,339
know nothing and you read this argument

1086
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,920
why was this 51 million well because

1087
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,700
this red square is really big and you

1088
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,118
know so

1089
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,140
maybe if you know if you know this

1090
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,540
you're like yeah this but is this does

1091
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,020
this make more sense than anything else

1092
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,900
right so no so I would say no need to

1093
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,400
complain

1094
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,440
um the technology is amazing and it

1095
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,060
keeps getting better so people working

1096
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,480
on this maybe the maybe the you know the

1097
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,119
the motives are not quite I don't quite

1098
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,800
agree with them but the technology is

1099
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,859
great and this is what

1100
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,780
um kind of inspired it

1101
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,700
right and so

1102
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,260
and you know and the nice thing about

1103
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,700
zero knowledge and all this privacy

1104
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,500
stuff is that you can really use the

1105
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,200
exact same technology and only small

1106
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,820
changes will be needed to obtain

1107
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,820
virtually any policy that one wants and

1108
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,099
and so now maybe if you're afraid but

1109
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,099
you know if the banks start using this

1110
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,480
um now we're going to lose all privacy

1111
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,339
but I think no we're actually going to

1112
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:45,859
have privacy and the reason is this

1113
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,359
um so why do companies actually like

1114
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,700
privacy so there are reasons against

1115
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,339
privacy right well if you don't have if

1116
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:54,900
you don't promise privacy you can sell

1117
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,720
user data that makes money

1118
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,760
um you can also use user data to make

1119
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,260
the user happier

1120
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,000
so you know if you know more about the

1121
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,740
user you can kind of tell them which

1122
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,540
restaurant to go to and so it really

1123
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,880
really to help the user so so this is

1124
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,619
you know this is good and the user will

1125
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:12,780
be happy but then it also Arguments for

1126
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,700
privacy so first of all it sounds good

1127
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,640
and people think they want it

1128
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,440
um of course there's also keeping their

1129
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
user away from the competitive from

1130
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,000
competitors but I think the main reason

1131
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,520
why a lot of companies and you know even

1132
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
Banks or whatever anyone else wants

1133
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,480
privacy is because there's no liability

1134
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,400
for user behavior and I think every

1135
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,900
company does not want to have liability

1136
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,940
so they they argue for privacy and they

1137
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,780
say well we don't know what they're

1138
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,880
doing if it's a law if it's okay to to

1139
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,920
have privacy they say look we don't know

1140
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,420
what the user is doing

1141
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,820
okay so I think we will have privacy not

1142
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,920
maybe not for the reasons that everyone

1143
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,079
loves privacy but there will be selfish

1144
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,119
reasons why we will have privacy

1145
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,140
and um and then so now actually central

1146
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,240
banks and Banks they want that and then

1147
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,000
so they say this and then they also say

1148
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,300
we also want Quantum safe because I

1149
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,859
don't know because

1150
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,960
the things we do are kind of shady so we

1151
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,099
don't want them to be known in the

1152
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,599
future

1153
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,940
um so so then the the question is should

1154
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,619
they be Quantum safe by Design right

1155
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,839
away and the answer I usually give is

1156
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,820
that well you should definitely be

1157
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,560
Quantum safe against Harvest and decrypt

1158
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,119
so you should not just use classical

1159
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,380
encryption you should not use

1160
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,020
computationally hiding commitments uh it

1161
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,300
should all be secure you know if

1162
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,980
somebody stores the information Harvest

1163
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,800
information now they should be able to

1164
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,700
um

1165
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,760
should not be able to decrypt it

1166
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,960
and there should be a simple path to

1167
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,300
Quantum safe so for example you should

1168
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,859
not be using Primitives that probably

1169
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,960
will not have Quantum safe equivalents

1170
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,040
efficient ones so I think

1171
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,780
non-interactive key exchange is much

1172
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,180
less efficient oprfs are going to be

1173
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,980
much more less efficient threshold

1174
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,500
anything will probably be very different

1175
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,900
so my predictions for moving to Quantum

1176
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,119
say for the following so I think that

1177
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,800
zero knowledge proofs will be much more

1178
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,420
important to Quantum safe than for

1179
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,220
classical schemes in the classical world

1180
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,900
because there's a lot of things we can

1181
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,339
build kind of generically with your

1182
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,440
knowledge proofs that we cannot build

1183
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,420
otherwise but we could with the

1184
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,800
classical schemes

1185
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,020
uh just because we don't have enough uh

1186
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,260
algebraic structure I also think that

1187
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,700
more efficient so there's a lot of work

1188
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,079
in zero knowledge proofs but I think

1189
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,460
that more efficient zero knowledge

1190
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,380
proofs can be built based on lattice

1191
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,640
assumptions than with just hash

1192
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,440
functions but both will remain relevant

1193
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,119
and the simple reasons for is okay now

1194
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,040
we have it and also because once you

1195
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,900
make a computational assumption it's

1196
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,339
obviously it's obviously going to help

1197
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:35,040
you right so so you you will be able to

1198
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,300
do something better based on

1199
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,599
computational assumptions and for added

1200
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,900
efficiency we'll have assumptions beyond

1201
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,599
the standard lattice ones and so now I

1202
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,220
want to maybe a little bit talk about

1203
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,640
actual technical things that maybe this

1204
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,700
can help you know with privacy in the

1205
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,560
quantum safe world

1206
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,140
so how to build things based on lattices

1207
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,240
so this is the uh the fundamental

1208
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,099
lattice equation

1209
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,560
as equals T so you have a public a you

1210
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,079
have a secret s you multiply a by S you

1211
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,420
get T and Norm of s is small this

1212
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,160
appears everywhere many schemes require

1213
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,260
proving knowledge of such an S so this

1214
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,359
is this is the you know the discrete log

1215
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,579
equation of the classical world this is

1216
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,440
the the equation of the lattice world

1217
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,599
and of course the sister LW probably

1218
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,060
depends how you set up a is you're given

1219
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,680
a and t and you're asked to find s

1220
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,140
okay so uh the comparison with discrete

1221
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,000
log why are things a bit harder in the

1222
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,619
lattice world is the following so in the

1223
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,240
lattice world we have a s equals T where

1224
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,280
s is small in discrete log you just have

1225
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,440
G to the S equals T you don't have this

1226
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,359
restriction on S and the restriction on

1227
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,160
S is the hard part

1228
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,740
this is just an algebraic relation while

1229
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,300
in the lattice world you have an

1230
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,880
algebraic relation and the range proof

1231
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,460
and the quadratic relation over Z right

1232
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,079
so the norm is a quadratic relation over

1233
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,300
z a range proof is to show that the norm

1234
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,099
is small so this is where things get

1235
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,680
less efficient

1236
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,359
and um

1237
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,980
but there's been a lot of work in this

1238
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,920
area so about 2018 there was I mean

1239
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,720
we're just using generic techniques from

1240
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,420
coding based zero knowledge proofs but

1241
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,920
then they've really improved in the last

1242
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,780
five years so we went from proving for

1243
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,460
proving simple relations from just like

1244
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,920
three megabytes it was now it's just a

1245
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,839
few a dozen kilobytes

1246
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,760
right so this is efficient and uh even

1247
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,400
more interesting is some work that work

1248
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,619
for sublinear zero knowledge proof so

1249
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,660
for any relation and there was nothing

1250
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,180
in 2018 you had to use generic hash

1251
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,859
based stuff and now you can get

1252
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:37,380
something that is around 60 kilobytes

1253
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,640
maybe even less

1254
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,220
so you basically snarks are quite

1255
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,800
compact with lattices

1256
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,839
um so I wanna but the thing is we still

1257
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,280
wanna you know 12 is still better than

1258
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,640
60 and we want to use the linear uh this

1259
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,560
proof system as as much as possible so

1260
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,359
it's very fast uh just a few

1261
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,920
milliseconds so a lot of space zero

1262
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,060
knowledge proofs if you just want to

1263
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,339
prove simple relations

1264
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,920
um are quite quite nice

1265
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
so

1266
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,280
um I'm just going to give a very short

1267
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,020
outline of how this was done you know

1268
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,700
you have to how these algebraic

1269
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,500
relations were proved so we have this

1270
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,240
ring whatever ring

1271
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,400
and we already knew how to prove linear

1272
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,319
relations over this ring so this just

1273
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,359
came with commitment schemes so then

1274
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,980
later you can actually prove quadratic

1275
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,660
relations so this was this was the work

1276
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,220
these are the works that started this

1277
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,300
whole push

1278
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,560
uh you can now you could prove a

1279
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,599
quadratic relations over the ring then

1280
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,760
you can prove inner product over the

1281
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,380
integers so now kind of moving to the

1282
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,819
integers becomes a little more difficult

1283
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:35,520
but you can do that and then you prove I

1284
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,020
do proofs of inner products over the

1285
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,720
integers so kind of these kind of simple

1286
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,500
steps logical steps they I'm not going

1287
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,579
to talk about your knowledge proofs

1288
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,260
maybe some of you are going to this

1289
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,579
Workshop in Luzan on Monday it's going

1290
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,140
to be there but it should be online

1291
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,720
somewhere as well

1292
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,940
um yes so this is what um what has been

1293
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,060
done in lattices and and um combining

1294
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,099
zero knowledge proofs with the trapdoor

1295
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,339
sampling gets you Anonymous credentials

1296
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,920
and I will shortly explain this mostly

1297
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,960
because I don't think that because I

1298
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,099
think this is the most interesting thing

1299
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,480
but I think the Assumption the new

1300
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,040
assumption I want some Crypt analyst to

1301
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,020
break it or attack it and say they

1302
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,140
cannot break it okay so uh lattice has a

1303
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,640
lot of lattices um you know this start

1304
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,980
in 2008 is is based on the security of

1305
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,900
giving out pre-images so for example if

1306
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,940
you have a random Matrix a and I have an

1307
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,859
oracle the following Oracle so it

1308
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:32,040
generates a vector why and then samples

1309
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,140
an s from some distribution where the

1310
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,720
norm of s is small such that a s equals

1311
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,500
y

1312
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,800
so it does pre-image sampling is this

1313
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,440
Oracle useful so

1314
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,260
it is useless because the same

1315
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,420
distribution Sy can be generated the

1316
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,160
other way around so you generate a small

1317
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,740
s and then compute as equals y so if the

1318
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,119
two distribution if the distributions

1319
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,460
are the same then this Oracle that gives

1320
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,040
you out pre-images is not very useful so

1321
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,619
this was the kind of the the basis of

1322
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,859
this breakthrough work of gpv with their

1323
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,680
signature scheme uh Gentry pieces so

1324
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,079
they had a random Matrix a and they had

1325
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,300
they basically had an oracle when given

1326
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,540
a message it generates a small s which

1327
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,300
is the pre-image of the random Oracle

1328
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,339
um so h of okay M should be X

1329
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:24,599
the pre-image of H of X right because

1330
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:25,859
it's a random Oracle is the same thing

1331
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,839
as a random thing right so this is

1332
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,300
useless because exactly because s h of X

1333
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,359
can be generated by moving forward

1334
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,880
generating an S Computing a s equals y

1335
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,339
and then programming h of x to be y

1336
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,079
right so this is the gpv signature

1337
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,760
scheme

1338
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,460
so then the question that we want to ask

1339
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,339
is the problem is that if you start want

1340
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:48,660
to start doing zero knowledge proofs now

1341
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,220
you have to do zero knowledge proofs on

1342
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,619
H and H is if H is a random Oracle it's

1343
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:54,660
not great and even if it's like some

1344
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,760
structured function people are using for

1345
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,079
zero knowledge proofs it's still not

1346
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,480
super great because

1347
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,700
um the domain of uh you know you have to

1348
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,319
map into the lattice domain which is

1349
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,480
much bigger so it's not just 32 bytes to

1350
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,960
32 bytes it's 32 bytes to quite a bit

1351
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,960
so you maybe don't want to use a random

1352
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,760
Oracle so this is a question what if H

1353
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,880
is not a random Oracle what if you

1354
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,640
have an oracle that generates an X in

1355
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,500
some set m

1356
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,839
and then generates a small s from a

1357
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,300
distribution that as equals f of x

1358
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,740
right so it's not you can no longer

1359
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,160
argue that f of x Is Random

1360
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,920
um because you know X is known f is

1361
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,240
known

1362
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,440
um and it's not a random or you can't

1363
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,020
model this random Oracle is this hard

1364
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,359
is this Oracle useful

1365
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,300
to generate pre-images of another of

1366
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,480
something new right so can I then if I

1367
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,700
can do if I'm given pre-images of f of x

1368
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,700
for random X can I create a pre-image of

1369
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,520
f of x star for a random X star

1370
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,280
that's given to me

1371
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,859
even if f is a linear function so this

1372
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:04,200
looks extremely dangerous and actually

1373
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,780
when we were trying to build Anonymous

1374
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,819
credentials we had something very

1375
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,040
complicated and we wrote well you

1376
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,680
obviously cannot do this

1377
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,339
um but then if you then erased it

1378
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:21,480
because uh it's actually not obvious at

1379
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,880
all that this is dangerous so for

1380
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,460
example even if it's linear right so

1381
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,000
let's say I give you pre-images of

1382
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,640
you know F of X1 F of X2 so now you can

1383
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,440
you know they're linear you can combine

1384
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,880
them so now you have pre-image of X1

1385
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,700
plus X2 okay so this is the dangerous

1386
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,640
part right because now you have

1387
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,700
pre-images of something new

1388
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:50,359
and S1 plus S2 is still kind of small

1389
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,240
but the problem is X1 plus X2 may not be

1390
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,859
in this set m

1391
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,920
right so this is the part that makes it

1392
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,839
not obvious at all that this is

1393
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:02,520
dangerous

1394
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,800
right so it's linear but the set itself

1395
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,300
is not

1396
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,280
so for example let's say m is the set of

1397
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,740
binary vectors so if you if you have

1398
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,440
pre-images for random X1 and X2 well X1

1399
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,540
plus X2 is not going to be binary

1400
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,220
right so there's a very low probability

1401
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,160
of that you can you can definitely find

1402
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,680
some combination that gets you back a

1403
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,839
binary Vector but now the pre-images

1404
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,599
become much larger

1405
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,000
and this is kind of you know this is the

1406
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,760
limit of my Crypt analytic ability

1407
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,859
um so kind of stop they say well it's

1408
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,260
probably secure and I don't know how

1409
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,819
many lattice script analysts are here

1410
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,619
but this seems like a very natural

1411
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,319
problem to replace a random Oracle with

1412
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:46,319
something else that you know that allows

1413
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,240
for more efficient zero knowledge proofs

1414
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,339
and so we made this assumption the

1415
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:52,859
whatever the CIS f with the F so you're

1416
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,020
given an oracle that generates a random

1417
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,819
X in some set

1418
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,099
uh you're given lots of pre-images for

1419
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,839
it you give a lot of pre images for this

1420
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:04,020
f of x and can you come up with a fresh

1421
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,079
s star X star

1422
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,740
so that a s star equals f of x

1423
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,900
I mean this is a high level thing I mean

1424
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,420
the the exact uh definition is in the

1425
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,619
paper

1426
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,059
um and then if you can do that you can

1427
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:20,400
build Anonymous credentials

1428
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,040
so you have a basically you have the

1429
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,960
user in the back in the issuer right

1430
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,460
here the user has a public key there's

1431
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,079
some public Randomness and a linear

1432
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,180
function so what the user does is he

1433
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,460
commits to his credentials so this is a

1434
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,920
very this is kind of the obvious thing

1435
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,540
to do this is kind of like the fishland

1436
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,119
line signature approach so the thing to

1437
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,500
do if you just have zero knowledge

1438
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,020
proofs and the trapdoor functions

1439
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,380
um so you have a small Norm Vector s u c

1440
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,960
you which um for for your kind of

1441
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,940
brevity will contain the credentials and

1442
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,140
the commitment

1443
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,359
and then you just commit to it and you

1444
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:55,619
give us your knowledge proof that it's

1445
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:57,119
of the right form

1446
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,760
then the the bank will just check the

1447
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,660
proof

1448
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,900
then he will choose a random X and then

1449
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,900
use the trapdoor to compute s with a

1450
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,940
small Norm to the pre-image of t plus f

1451
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,160
of x so no it's not f of x it's t plus f

1452
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,800
of x but T was a special form and he

1453
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,760
sends the S back and then the user just

1454
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,460
outputs the credential he wants

1455
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,000
um

1456
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,500
and there's zero knowledge proof that he

1457
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,599
knows all the rest and the point is that

1458
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,040
if f is a linear function he's just

1459
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,020
proving linear relations

1460
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,800
and um this is this is very efficient

1461
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,780
okay so and this but this is actually

1462
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,940
like I said this is t plus f of x so

1463
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,800
this is the interactive Isis function

1464
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,040
Isis assumption so now you're not really

1465
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,339
given access to random pre-images of f

1466
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:46,800
of x you're actually sending some low

1467
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,140
known Vector C and then you're getting

1468
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,740
pre-images of so s of b c plus f of x

1469
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,839
you can sort of modify the target a

1470
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,220
little bit

1471
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,859
uh and the question is still the same

1472
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:01,859
okay so this is the Assumption

1473
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:04,619
um if time permits hopefully not and it

1474
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,440
does not that's wonderful uh so there is

1475
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,960
a reduction between the two

1476
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,800
um which which is not not card but I

1477
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,480
don't want to talk about it and the

1478
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,280
result is that it's pretty efficient so

1479
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,599
it's um

1480
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,579
you get schemes that based on this

1481
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,920
interactive Isis which are quite short

1482
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,079
if you want a full reduction to this

1483
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:26,460
other Isis

1484
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,500
I I don't think it has to be this bad it

1485
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,839
doesn't cover by a factor of five you

1486
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,280
can do it less but we didn't really try

1487
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,780
that much

1488
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,319
um

1489
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,359
and I honestly don't think for lattices

1490
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,339
you would be able to do much better than

1491
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:40,740
this maybe maybe 2018 but you're not

1492
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,540
going to get something with one or two

1493
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,280
so it's still definitely a lot worse

1494
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,280
than things you get with strong RSA and

1495
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,520
um you know other funny assumptions

1496
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,579
based on pairings but um

1497
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,280
it's it might even be faster because for

1498
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,079
example lattice encryption schemes are

1499
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,119
faster than the elliptic curve ones so

1500
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,980
efficiency wise it's definitely duped

1501
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,720
um yeah so this is basically what I

1502
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,220
wanted to talk about right privacy from

1503
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,300
lattices and um and stuff so there is um

1504
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,859
uh there's you know there's one area

1505
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,599
which is zero knowledge and applications

1506
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,300
that's privacy there's another big area

1507
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,160
which I did not talk about which is very

1508
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,020
related to lattices right which is fhe

1509
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,359
right but that's you know a whole thing

1510
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:27,000
on its own and uh right I mean it's

1511
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,880
there and I'm uh sorry for not

1512
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,440
mentioning it I hope no Belgian is

1513
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,839
involved in it so it does not attack

1514
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,599
other schemes uh because of it and uh

1515
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,390
yeah so thank you

1516
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:48,029
[Applause]

1517
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,700
thank you very much so there's time for

1518
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,839
questions if people have questions

1519
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,240
please come to the microphones at the

1520
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,359
front

1521
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,480
so while people consider their questions

1522
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,520
so you mentioned unbalanced oil and

1523
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,420
vinegar

1524
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,160
very briefly

1525
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,140
you also mentioned oh maybe you want to

1526
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,260
compare compare something like frodochem

1527
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,839
and ring wlwe so can you have something

1528
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,200
like unbalanced module lwe

1529
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,900
unbalanced unbalanced module elderly to

1530
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,760
to get a bit of the best of the Both

1531
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,740
Worlds or is that completely nonsensical

1532
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,559
what what is balanced modulated no no

1533
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,960
but with balance

1534
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,260
everything looks the same I guess

1535
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,000
you want the Matrix to not to have some

1536
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,800
holes in it or

1537
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,099
well maybe so you had a two by two by

1538
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:43,619
two by two and maybe you can have like a

1539
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:46,859
one by one and a five by five instead ah

1540
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,400
I see

1541
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:52,740
so actually you you could so you could

1542
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,700
have let's say the top row be

1543
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,000
I guess you know small degree

1544
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,760
the bottom one a larger degree so so the

1545
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,579
the reason no it's it's not so this is

1546
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,140
something that could be useful somewhere

1547
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,660
but the point is in in lattices if you

1548
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,220
have a large if you're working over a

1549
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,740
larger ring you can always write it as

1550
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,660
sort of isomorphic operations over a

1551
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,640
smaller ring so then it's not going to

1552
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,280
be any harder than of working over a

1553
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,000
smaller ring but but yeah you could

1554
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,300
but I'm not the thing is it that you

1555
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,339
don't really get much of an Advan much

1556
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:30,839
of a secure I don't believe there's much

1557
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:32,160
of a security

1558
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,859
um gain if you work over much smaller in

1559
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,960
than slightly larger rings so I think

1560
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,660
you either you go down to lwe or just

1561
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,460
kind of modular will be with just a

1562
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,200
little bit like kyber is as good is good

1563
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,099
enough

1564
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,619
but but yeah the unbalanced thing is is

1565
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,420
an assumption that sometimes is useful

1566
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,720
to make in in some some cases

1567
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:58,859
so you said that uh you expect that zero

1568
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:00,420
knowledge will be used much more with

1569
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,760
lattices than with like discrete log

1570
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,559
things Quantum safe yeah Quantum safe

1571
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,880
yeah because there's less structure and

1572
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,559
there are lots of applications where

1573
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,040
using groups and DL stuff you can you

1574
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,559
can do it and then with the lattices and

1575
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,400
Quantum safe assumptions you can't so uh

1576
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,800
off the top of your head like what are

1577
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,960
you know the top five such applications

1578
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,380
top five I'll give you top one

1579
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,720
so okay so the top one is um so first of

1580
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,640
all okay so for example blind signatures

1581
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,700
yes I think that's that's one and I'd

1582
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,920
say Anonymous credentials is too uh

1583
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,059
threshold

1584
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:42,059
um yeah I would say you just do it with

1585
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:43,980
zero knowledge in the trivial way yes

1586
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,900
because I I mean people have this is

1587
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,240
something people have tried to do I very

1588
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,480
briefly tried to do zero success yeah

1589
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,599
because from discrete log the threshold

1590
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:58,319
signatures for example are efficient

1591
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,180
so yeah

1592
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,760
I think so yeah yeah okay yeah I know

1593
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,920
that they are not from lattices okay

1594
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,980
okay that's three is fine okay thanks

1595
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,819
um well first I want to confirm that the

1596
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:18,180
this pqc is in fact quite boring

1597
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,180
um

1598
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:25,079
and also I'm wondering about the IP

1599
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,460
situation you gave a potential solution

1600
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,220
that involves like the individual

1601
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,720
responsibility I was wondering if you

1602
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,780
have any ideas on what maybe this could

1603
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,500
do or in at an organization level

1604
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,160
so uh so definitely not have I know

1605
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,099
nothing about IP right as kind of

1606
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:50,040
demonstrated by my incompetence

1607
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,559
when faced with problems

1608
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,079
um but I think something that nist could

1609
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:56,400
have done or organizations could have

1610
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,260
done ahead of time and I think this is

1611
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,780
something they they did say yeah they

1612
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,000
kind of wish they did is ahead of time

1613
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,640
do a huge IP search right this dead a

1614
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,520
lot of effort and then think of all the

1615
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,559
things that could have been bad and then

1616
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,680
you can file these um

1617
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,260
okay demonstrating my lack of knowledge

1618
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,760
here again so there are these things you

1619
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,160
can file ahead of time saying we have a

1620
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,960
scheme and we want to say that the IP

1621
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,660
whatever this IP is not does not cover

1622
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,819
the scheme so you can kind of get ahead

1623
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,640
of the game and then it's up to the IP

1624
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,859
owner to either ignore it and say okay

1625
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:35,700
whatever or fight it but of course now

1626
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,319
the kind of all the power is now with

1627
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:40,200
you because if he fights it well he will

1628
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,500
lose money if he loses he loses money if

1629
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,720
he wins we just won't use this stuff so

1630
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,059
he has nothing to gain so this is a very

1631
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:49,920
powerful weapon that

1632
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,780
should be used in the future and could

1633
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,640
have been used but of course it also

1634
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,579
requires a lot of groundwork to figure

1635
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:00,480
out what IP could possibly be used right

1636
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,000
so I think this is the one thing you can

1637
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,339
do the other thing I really

1638
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:08,240
think is really in the individual

1639
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,779
responsibility for us

1640
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,700
okay are there any further questions

1641
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,500
yeah margolf

1642
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,540
maybe a little bit of a follow-up

1643
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,520
question on on the IP stuff because

1644
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,839
super important

1645
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:22,500
um

1646
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,200
yeah I guess that what big companies do

1647
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,119
like IBM they kind of build up an

1648
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,180
arsenal of Ip so that they have more IP

1649
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,920
than other companies and so if someone

1650
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,500
tries to annoy them then they will annoy

1651
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,140
them even more with their IP so so that

1652
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,819
seems to work maybe for big companies

1653
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:40,440
but it doesn't seem to work like for the

1654
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,720
channel population so do you have any

1655
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,940
way of kind of doing something a bit

1656
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,180
smarter that kind of also helps like the

1657
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,819
individuals some legal engineering or

1658
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:54,299
something like GPL license type thing or

1659
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:55,980
common criteria and I mean some some

1660
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,660
smart lawyer probably has to do some

1661
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,160
adversarial thinking and find something

1662
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,799
because we are that's even Beyond uh

1663
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:04,559
cryptographic adversarial thinking yeah

1664
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,140
right exactly so baby I mean you called

1665
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,299
me out I'm speaking from a fairly

1666
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:11,339
privileged position whereas or I'm lucky

1667
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:14,880
that our uh managerial chain

1668
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,160
realizes that you should not be creating

1669
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,740
security IP because then things are not

1670
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,180
going to be compatible no one's going to

1671
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,400
use it so the IP like you said is for

1672
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,079
products and it's mostly defensive just

1673
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,880
if you annoy us we will annoy you and

1674
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,640
okay it wastes everyone time but it you

1675
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,680
know you know when Google and Google and

1676
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,540
my in Microsoft I don't know who they

1677
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,880
had a patent War they were just piling

1678
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,200
up the

1679
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,240
the IP and no one would read it they

1680
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,660
would just kind of just weigh the stacks

1681
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,980
so for small companies yeah it's

1682
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,440
definitely a much harder thing but as I

1683
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,760
have obviously no solution right if

1684
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,440
there was an easy solution that it would

1685
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,380
be done but I at least think that

1686
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,740
it's not so bad if you have IP and then

1687
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,839
you actually make a product right and

1688
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,460
this is uh you know so you can say

1689
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,440
whatever like RSA

1690
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,780
and they made a product right so this

1691
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,880
was completely new and they they had IP

1692
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,220
and they profited uh very well came from

1693
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,440
University right Akamai same thing right

1694
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,500
so in the small company sure if you make

1695
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,180
a product with some brilliant idea

1696
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,460
that's all right yeah sure of course we

1697
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,140
all wish it was available to everyone

1698
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,059
for free but that's not how the world

1699
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:23,220
works right but I think the the biggest

1700
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,839
problem at least what I was trying to

1701
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,119
say is that if you make IP with no

1702
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,400
intention to to Pro to Market to make a

1703
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,200
product out of it then there's a good

1704
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,579
chance it'll be used for something bad

1705
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:34,559
and maybe that's something you should

1706
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,819
not do but if you know if you're gonna

1707
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:37,260
if you think I am going to start a

1708
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,260
company okay and you know it's not so

1709
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,460
bad

1710
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,339
okay so I think we'll leave it there

1711
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:47,220
we'll have a coffee break next so let's

1712
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,860
thanks for team again

1713
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:59,249
[Applause]

1714
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,420
I wanted to say hello because I saw your

1715
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,880
face and I was like we've only met

1716
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,119
virtual
