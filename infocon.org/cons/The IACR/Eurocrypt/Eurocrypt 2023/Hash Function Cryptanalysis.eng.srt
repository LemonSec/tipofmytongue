1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
everyone Welcome to the

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,660
first session of the day my name is

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,340
for the session is on hash function

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,400
Crypt analysis we're going to have three

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,259
papers presented

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,120
the first paper

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,600
is called meet in the middle pre-image

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,900
attacks on Sponge base hashing it is a

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,220
paper by lingu King yeah young dong

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,899
is going to give the talk

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,540
thanks for the introduction good morning

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,780
everyone my name is Haydon in this talk

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,300
I will present our work on meet in the

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,700
middle pre-image attacks on Sponge hash

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,020
functions

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,680
so this talk is divided into four parts

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,500
in the first part I will briefly review

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,780
the meet in the middle attack especially

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,480
the attack on hash functions

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
so meeting in the middle attack is a

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,939
generic technique for symmetric keyword

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,180
analysis which was first proposed by

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,840
difi and Herman in the year 1977.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,720
the idea of meeting the middle attack is

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
actually

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,960
it divides the whole space into two

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,439
parts and we find clearance between them

28
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,479
so it's actually

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,720
um efficiently to executively search a

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,580
space based on diversity attack

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,500
the application is the meat in the

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,600
middle attack on block ciphers with

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
double encryption

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,159
in the past decades the meat

35
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,200
instrumental attack has been widely

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
applied to the current analysis of both

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,500
block ciphers and hash functions and

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,680
between some of which has been have been

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,840
broken like md4 md5 and so on and in the

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,299
meantime various techniques has been

41
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,119
proposed to improve the framework of

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,640
meat in the middle attack and there are

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,740
also some automatic tools I don't think

44
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,879
I have time to introduce the related

45
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,400
works please refer to the papers if you

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,300
are interested in it

47
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,120
so let's look further on look further at

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
the meet in the middle attack on hash

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
functions currently most meet in the

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,340
middle attack on hash functions are

51
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,860
targeting the so-called Market

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,440
construction so in the mercod

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
construction the compression function as

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,879
usually built by a block Cipher via some

55
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,599
hashing mode which usually use a feed

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,000
forward mechanism so it it falls it is a

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,819
closed computation path

58
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,760
with this closed communication path we

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,700
can deploy the soap so-called splice and

60
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,400
Cloud meet in the middle attacks so

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,300
first we cut the compression function

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,340
into two chunks

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
at certain internal runs and then one

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,060
chunk is computed forward and the other

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,060
chunk is computed backward and finally

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,239
both chunks will arrive at the same

67
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,620
common room

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,819
and we can check a match here and note

69
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,879
that the forward chunk is actually

70
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,239
computed across the first several runs

71
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,060
and the last several runs via the feed

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,480
forward mechanism of the hashing mode

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,540
so in a high level the splice and cut

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,599
meat in the middle can be divided into

75
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,360
three configurations the first one is

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
the chunk separation so we need to give

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,220
the initial structure and the matching

78
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,640
points the second one is to select two

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,840
neutral sets colored by Blue and the red

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,519
which determines the degree of the

81
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,280
freedom of each chunk the third one is

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
to give a relation used for partial

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,920
matching which determines the filtering

84
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,860
ability also named as the degree of

85
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,840
matching

86
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
then it's natural to a natural question

87
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,620
is that that it still work when it comes

88
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,680
to the sponge hash functions

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,400
let's see for sponge hash functions if

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,120
we start similarly from some internal

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,180
rods in the middle we have to satisfy

92
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,360
not only the eight speed Target in the

93
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,540
forward Computing path but also to

94
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,740
satisfy the CBD capacity value in the

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,040
back in the backward computation path

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,540
which means we have to search a space of

97
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,040
2 to the h plus C to find the pre-image

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,840
of the given Target

99
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,020
considering the time complexity of the

100
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,440
exhaustive search is 2 to the H it may

101
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
not be a good idea so we prefer to

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,699
searching for a more compact space

103
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,979
so in the second part I will show you

104
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,259
our new framework of meet in the middle

105
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,960
attack and sponge based hashing and I

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,639
will also give the automatic tools

107
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,340
this is the framework of our meet in the

108
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,360
middle attack

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,960
so in this framework we choose to start

110
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,900
from the r bit read part and so and all

111
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,500
the computation passes are forward

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,620
if R is larger than H then uh H and HP

113
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,240
Subspace of the read part is enough to

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,780
find the pre-image of the given Target

115
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,120
like the previous meet in the middle

116
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,380
attack we also need three configurations

117
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,780
we need to select two neutral blue and

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,860
red stats and we need two independent

119
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,100
forward computation tasks and we need a

120
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,960
matching point

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,380
uh two other things to mention here

122
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,500
first in order to attack morons we

123
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,520
sometimes will partially uh solve the

124
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,919
inverse of the permutation from the HB

125
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,020
Target to the matching point

126
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,479
second we sometimes set some conditions

127
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,180
to control the propagation of the

128
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,340
characteristics

129
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,660
leave your seat in more details leader

130
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,919
so the meeting in the Middle episode is

131
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,680
as follows for all the values in the red

132
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,199
neutral set we compute forward to the

133
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,960
matching points and for all the values

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,660
in the blue set we also compute forward

135
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,220
to the matching point

136
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,800
and we compute backward with the known

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,319
HP Target to the matching points to

138
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,699
derive a filter and then we filled the

139
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,740
states

140
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,440
in the following I will take a check as

141
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,800
an example to show our automatic search

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,960
model

143
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,060
let's first look at it in a high level

144
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,180
and then we will go into details in each

145
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,139
step

146
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,979
so according to the three configurations

147
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,380
we need to model the starting state

148
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,500
to model the attribute of propagation

149
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,319
and to model the matching phase

150
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,419
and we also use some accelerary

151
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,139
techniques like setting conditions and

152
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,120
we use linear structure in the starting

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,940
State and we use the city kernel in the

154
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,680
matching series

155
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,539
note that in the five steps in the round

156
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,080
permutation in Cataract F

157
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,120
the row and Pi only change the big

158
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
station and the last step is a constant

159
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,720
addition so we only need to consider the

160
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,479
Theta operation and the Xbox operation

161
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,840
um

162
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,300
in in our model we use five colors to

163
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,940
present each bit the gray is constant

164
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,120
the red and blue is active and the green

165
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,639
is actually a linear expression of the

166
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,000
red and the blue or gray beads the white

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,640
one is unknown bead

168
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
since we have five colors we use a 3-bit

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,839
encoding scheme to represent them note

170
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,500
that in previous work there are only

171
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,660
four colors but in our model we

172
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,660
introduced green

173
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,420
to represent the addition of the blue

174
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,060
and the red beads which can also be used

175
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,839
in our model

176
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
in the starting state

177
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,300
each speed can take one color of gray

178
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,959
blue or red but we don't pick it

179
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,800
randomly instead we

180
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
choose to follow the linear structure so

181
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,820
that we can skip the first round for

182
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,959
free

183
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,420
Let's see we

184
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,860
we set bits in this line and this this

185
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,920
line in the same color and similarly for

186
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,420
this line and this limb and we need to

187
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,920
require the bit in this uh this one and

188
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,459
the x or of the beating uh here and the

189
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,040
bead here is constant

190
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,240
so after the Zeta operation

191
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,839
the color we are not diffused and after

192
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,380
the pi and the row and Pi operation the

193
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,260
color Beyond none of the two colors will

194
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,680
be adjacent in the same row

195
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,399
uh then in the next uh as box operation

196
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,720
we choose to set more strict construct

197
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,620
conditions to control the diffusion so

198
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,940
we

199
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,320
we set the right bit of the active bit

200
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,540
be zero and we set the left bit of the

201
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,740
variable B1 so that we can linearize the

202
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,279
Chi operation so that we can skip it

203
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,060
which means we can get the output of the

204
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,640
first round by only considering the

205
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,360
linear operation of the input

206
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,660
then for the Theta operation we depose

207
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,480
it into three steps

208
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,060
first in the first step we consider the

209
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,899
xor of uh bits in the column

210
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,120
and in the second step we consider the

211
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
xor of two columns and the spinal step

212
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,720
is the final result of theta operation

213
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,839
so the the thing we need to do is to

214
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,839
model the xor operation with arbitrary

215
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,260
number of inputs actually we consider

216
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,140
all the possible situations and finally

217
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,800
we divide them into five classes

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,980
for example if the inputs have a known

219
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,440
this then the output is unknown is

220
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,839
simple

221
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,660
or if the inputs have blue or gray beats

222
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,720
then the output can be blue without

223
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,839
consuming degree of Freedom or it can be

224
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,899
grieved by consuming one degree of

225
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,680
freedom of blue

226
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,579
and we Define three binary variables two

227
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,720
with with five values to represent the

228
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,120
five conditions of the input and

229
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,640
and then we can give some inequalities

230
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,760
to restrict the input and output to

231
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,820
fulfill the five rules and we also have

232
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,480
some inequalities to uh constrain the

233
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,860
degree of the freedom

234
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,120
then for the chi operation

235
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,920
IBI plus 1 e i plus two

236
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,519
uh we similarly we also consider all the

237
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,959
situations here so uh

238
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,300
for each situation is actually

239
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,959
corresponds to a a point in a 12

240
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,720
dimensional space then we can derive the

241
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
linear inequalities by Computing the

242
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,560
convex hole

243
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,399
to give a relation used in the matching

244
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,120
phase we here use uh the property of the

245
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,980
chi operation which is if we know three

246
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,260
consecutive output bits then we can give

247
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,399
two linear equations of the input bits

248
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
so for catch act 5 12

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,899
suppose the hash value is the first

250
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,820
52 bits of the in the r plus one round

251
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,560
then we can use the search property to

252
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,980
derive these two equations

253
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,600
and what to do next is to uh is there is

254
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,779
a trick here we we choose to add the

255
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,740
Simpson on both sides so this equation

256
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,360
still holds right

257
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,800
so we get this ugly but very simple and

258
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,540
useful equations

259
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,660
and then uh according to the kernel

260
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,959
property of theta we can replace the xor

261
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,440
of theta value by the xor of a a value

262
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
so

263
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,839
the equation will be transformed uh in a

264
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,760
form in the following

265
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,760
similarly for the second one

266
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,639
so please see what we get what we get

267
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,120
now is actually some linear relations of

268
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,779
bits in the R1 from the hash value in

269
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,800
the r plus one round so

270
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,220
this equation can be used as a filter in

271
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,220
the matching phase but we need to note

272
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,779
note that the filter is valid only on

273
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,019
some conditions so this is these are the

274
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,940
conditions on matching points

275
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,420
in order to find Optimal attacks we

276
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,300
actually need to Max maximize the

277
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,160
minimum value of a degree of freedom of

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,060
the red set and the blue sets and also

279
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,339
the degree of matching points

280
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,120
we applied our techniques to catch

281
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
zodiac and eskom

282
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,740
for cat attack We performed the attack

283
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,699
with two massive blocks and we put the

284
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,459
meet in the middle episode in the second

285
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,440
message block so the attack model

286
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,079
involves too many states so we divide it

287
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,860
into four figures in our paper here is

288
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,760
only one of them

289
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,620
I I need to see that the degree of the

290
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,000
freedom of the red set is 108 and the

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,519
degree of the freedom of a blue set is

292
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,279
eight sorry there is a title here the

293
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,760
degree of matching is it

294
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
here is the summary of the attack result

295
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,459
of Catcher 512 note that our foreignute

296
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:57,000
attack is actually better than uh to

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,899
attack this rotational analysis so our

298
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,860
results actually breaks their nearly 10

299
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,720
years

300
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,540
analysis records and

301
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,660
our technique is is actually more

302
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,279
generic

303
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,540
not that previous image uh pre-image

304
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,060
attacks with the linear structure

305
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,600
technique only arrives three wrongs

306
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,660
and I don't have time to introduce the

307
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
application of uh

308
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,079
to ASCO and zulia in this talk but I put

309
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,500
the summary of the attack results here

310
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,199
so for zodiac we give the first three

311
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,100
wrong pre-image attack and for ascon we

312
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,860
give the first

313
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,079
three and four round pyramid attack

314
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,959
in the end I will conclude this uh this

315
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,279
paper

316
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,220
so our work can be seen as the first

317
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,560
attempt to apply the meet in the middle

318
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,439
attack on Sponge based hashing functions

319
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,339
with the milp automatic search model we

320
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,679
give the

321
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,780
improved pre-image attack on techtrack

322
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,599
and we also give the first pre-image

323
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,059
attack on three round escort and the

324
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,400
three round zodiac

325
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,339
uh actually uh

326
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,819
actually uh

327
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,559
further work can be done in several

328
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,980
directions for example we only consider

329
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,000
catch up 512 in this paper but you can

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
also consider other instances but

331
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,360
I'm not sure whether the linear

332
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,539
structure still works combined with the

333
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,160
meat in the middle attack

334
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,100
and we can also consider more tricks to

335
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,500
these automatic milp model to achieve

336
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,740
non-neglatable improvements

337
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,580
and since in our work it is a pre-image

338
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,520
attack we can also consider the clearing

339
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,580
attacks or pure recovery recovery

340
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,520
attacks actually my co-authors have done

341
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,580
something they post the work on

342
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,760
different please refer to it if you are

343
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,100
interested in it

344
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,130
thank you very much for your attention

345
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,980
[Applause]

346
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,600
any questions for the speaker

347
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,179
okay so I have a quick question did you

348
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,539
uh try maybe to uh apply your framework

349
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,840
maybe to more reduced versions but uh to

350
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,700
have some practical results

351
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,880
like maybe on a smaller

352
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,380
uh pre-image Target or fewer rounds but

353
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,580
some practical results

354
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,160
[Music]

355
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,299
you mean now or in the future no no uh

356
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,140
now did you maybe try

357
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,000
we haven't tried but we can do it I

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
think yeah okay thank you very much

359
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,780
okay so uh

360
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,580
there are no further questions and let's

361
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,260
thank the speaker again

362
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,600
thank you

363
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,000
[Applause]

364
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,720
okay so uh

365
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,380
the second talk will be presented a

366
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,620
paper called the analysis of write

367
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,440
md-160 new Collision attacks and finding

368
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,559
characteristics with milk the paper is

369
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,940
by Focus you

370
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,900
Anand Willie Mayer ing Lee and takanori

371
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,280
zobi and uh

372
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,178
is going to give the talk

373
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,460
thanks for the reduction in this talk I

374
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,500
will introduce our work on rap and

375
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,039
Bieber hungry 60 is a less popular craft

376
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
surfaces and also we are

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,520
trying to solve a bit old problem which

378
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,500
is to find the final differential

379
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,799
characteristic for the empty Shah family

380
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,799
so this is our overview of this talk so

381
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,440
let us start

382
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,100
is a hash functioning belonging to the

383
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,140
ambitious family invented by docking at

384
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,960
all fac in 1996

385
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
the main purpose is to strengthen the

386
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,720
security fmd5 because at their time the

387
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,179
property has already showed a semi-free

388
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,299
start cleaning for fluorine md5 oh yeah

389
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,260
although it is less popular than md5 and

390
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,880
xiao1 it being used in practice

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,160
especially the Vietnam Bitcoin yeah so

392
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,580
it's very important let alone it's also

393
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,299
a so IEC standard so

394
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,400
so we can

395
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,159
imagine ref and this I will simply say

396
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,760
randomly instead of 360. so that can be

397
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,980
we can view rep MB as two parallel

398
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,159
instances of md5 but of course in each

399
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,260
single Branch they are indeed different

400
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,080
from md5 because you can if we check

401
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,880
first there are 80 steps in yeah yeah

402
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,280
there are 80 rounds but EMB file we are

403
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,100
only 64 runs and if you also check the

404
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,559
Run function you can also find that each

405
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,980
internal State x i is updated with five

406
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,460
consecutive internal space while in nd5

407
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,720
uh it was updated in only

408
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,700
four consecutive steps so the difference

409
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,299
propagates in a much faster way in WebMD

410
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,740
and uh due to the more complex one

411
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,039
function uh so it's it becomes more

412
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,840
challenging to find valid differential

413
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,340
correct uh sign differential

414
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,740
characteristics and due to the double

415
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,299
Branch structure

416
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,220
it's also difficult to find the

417
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,320
conforming messages pairs giving a

418
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,380
specified differentiator and it's also

419
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,960
not easy to construct better local

420
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,760
cleanse to increase the number of

421
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,220
Attraction runs so in this thought I

422
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,880
will mailing uh show how to find Value

423
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,679
design differential characteristics for

424
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,919
WebMD so not so you may notice that

425
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,640
always emphasize very very well so why

426
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,000
why the validity is so important if you

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,299
have any experience in analyzing NBC has

428
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,520
something you will know there is uh

429
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,419
there are the differential

430
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,700
characteristics you should know that

431
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,280
there are many bit conditions in in

432
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,679
English and yeah yeah if you find this

433
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,179
differential practice we say you should

434
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,320
be careful uh of the contradictions in

435
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,039
these conditions yeah and uh in the case

436
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,740
of rampant B there are two places the

437
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,840
contradictions come from the first place

438
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,299
is the conditions imposed by the Boolean

439
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,299
functions and these are very uh special

440
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,960
place where another condition that which

441
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,380
is the condition in qi so you it's just

442
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,659
like this equation and we are alpha High

443
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,179
and the beta I a consequence derived

444
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,159
from the differential Trail

445
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,500
so that let me

446
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,679
give more details specifically uh for

447
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,780
for many hash functions in the remedies

448
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,820
family you will know each internal state

449
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,419
if I will be used in three consecutive

450
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,480
or even more steps in the Boolean

451
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,020
functions so for example uh XL will be

452
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,020
used three times uh in three consecutive

453
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,140
steps and at each round I mean steps run

454
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,320
have the same and each one there will be

455
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,200
different conditions imposed on X I so

456
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,880
finally these conditions will be

457
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,440
contradictory if we consider three

458
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,620
consecutive runs and uh another place

459
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,480
where the contradictions that were

460
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,120
contradictions occur is what I mean is

461
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,280
the conditions on QR so you can see

462
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,340
where Q how Qi is computed so Qi is

463
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,100
computed with x i and x i minus four and

464
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,500
if there are too many conditions on x i

465
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,440
and x i minus 4 there will be only a few

466
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
number of solutions of Qi satisfying

467
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
equation five and what's worse none of

468
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,880
these Solutions of Qi can satisfy

469
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,520
equation four so this is where another

470
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,020
place contributions

471
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,879
appear so yeah

472
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,280
values find your characteristic for fmd

473
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,299
but yeah we indeed have

474
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,280
mature and very powerful technique

475
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,380
called developed by

476
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,260
develop I think

477
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,600
I mean Chris increasing and the

478
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
following window so yeah they did a lot

479
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,980
of this work to improve continually

480
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,380
improve this technique so the main idea

481
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,480
according to my understanding is this

482
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,520
lecture in this figure the first

483
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,620
propagates the sign difference in two

484
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,380
directions and we call them the sparse

485
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,860
part and then we have to connect to

486
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,740
sparse path and

487
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,799
for for the com for the connection in

488
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,779
the middle part the the differential

489
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,880
characteristic will be very intense and

490
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
suddenly there will be many conditions

491
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,779
uh and very many conditions to be added

492
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,299
so contradiction is really first so we

493
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,779
have to uh careful we have to uh

494
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,179
efficiently detect the contradictions in

495
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,820
at least phase and this is what the get

496
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,740
and determining technique achieved and

497
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,140
if you have any experience to start to

498
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,700
deduce the such assigned differential

499
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,500
characteristics needed by hand you will

500
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,440
know this is in we indeed also do the

501
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,500
same way and connecting the sparse part

502
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,960
is really a very painful process and

503
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,539
once done it when I was undergraduate

504
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,000
students so yeah many contributions so

505
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,120
it's so painful and I cannot find the

506
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,820
valid one so but unfortunately this is

507
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,779
not open source but we can also we can

508
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,520
still access these tools they are very

509
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,159
kind and also collaborated some papers

510
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,880
with some of these courses but I want to

511
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,400
have my own tour and this is my personal

512
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,940
interest and we also know uh in recent

513
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,820
years the MRT said smt based methods are

514
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,159
very popular but we have not seen its

515
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,980
applications to this problem and maybe

516
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,380
we try a different approach and there

517
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,299
may be new potential

518
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,240
so let me highlight the difference

519
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,179
between our our our method we from

520
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,340
previous words so

521
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,779
yeah the last three points first we

522
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:23,580
encode the finite difference transitions

523
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,100
in the model for the first time I mean

524
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,640
so in Pre indeed in previous words there

525
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,419
there is this setback methods to solve

526
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,640
this problem but the only consider I

527
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,100
mean the middle part we only consider

528
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,700
the model to describe to describe to

529
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,720
parallel ready Transitions and we know

530
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,340
that the value transitions are very

531
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,580
expensive so we remove this and we

532
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,039
directly import the final difference

533
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,980
transitions but but

534
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,140
the contradictions easily curve we have

535
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,000
to efficiently detect the contradiction

536
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,900
so we we and one of the technique is

537
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,200
proposed as a crypto 2020 yeah yeah so

538
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
it's also one of my work but this model

539
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,900
is indeed very expensive so we do not

540
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,059
want the verification so we use a

541
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,200
relatively light method so we call it

542
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,539
monitoring technique I just want to use

543
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,059
a name to be distinguished from other

544
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,900
works I mean and that's the only belief

545
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,059
a similar idea has been used in the gas

546
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,740
and determined techniques otherwise we

547
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,480
cannot find a very differential

548
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,620
characteristic

549
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,140
so uh what how should we uh describe the

550
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,559
target problem just like uh the crypto

551
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,840
analysis of block ciphers what we need

552
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,360
to do is to describe how the sign

553
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,940
difference can propagates to the wrong

554
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,480
function of that and d and uh

555
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
and this is a run function so what we

556
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,940
need to do is to uh construct a uh I

557
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,760
mean to use constraints to describe the

558
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,320
relations between the finite difference

559
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,440
of the i i plus one I plus two I plus

560
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,900
three I plus four I plus 5 and the sign

561
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,240
difference of the message m

562
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,740
and if we consider better the bit level

563
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,080
the so this circulation indeed only

564
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,240
affects the order of variables so we

565
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,480
indeed can only consider a simpler form

566
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,140
so what we need to do is to uh

567
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,080
to find the relations between the sign

568
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,100
difference between a visual A1 A2 A3 A4

569
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,159
A5 and the sign difference a m

570
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,340
and if you have experience to deduce any

571
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,440
different characteristics by hand you

572
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
will know what we what do we really do

573
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,320
this

574
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,260
so we usually do this in this way so

575
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,179
first let me consider the modular

576
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,399
addition of the message and the constant

577
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,740
and then we consider the Boolean

578
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,080
function then we consider the sum of the

579
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,020
video and B1 they consider the sum of B2

580
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,220
and a0 then we consider before then we

581
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,679
can then we we consider the function so

582
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,140
the other then we consider yeah c y

583
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,260
equals to if we got maybe U.S think of

584
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,120
the last equation is a minimized but

585
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,840
it's even useful and in other words what

586
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,460
we need to do is to introduce many

587
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,120
intermediate variables to help trace the

588
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,880
evolution of the sign differences and

589
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
note that this is the one constant so we

590
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,640
indeed do not need b0 and we can simply

591
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,399
set the sign difference but usual is the

592
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,679
sign difference as a m

593
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,620
and again if you have this experienced

594
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,600
to produce such a characteristic at the

595
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,640
hand you should know

596
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,480
yeah what do we really do is like we

597
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,179
first did the ministry computes the same

598
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,940
difference transitions for the first

599
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,520
for this modularization this modulation

600
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,580
and this modular Edition what size what

601
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,720
does the ministers mean it means for

602
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,700
example we are given a solid difference

603
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,260
of X and Y and we want to compute a sign

604
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,860
difference of its modulation there are

605
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,779
indeed many possible significances but

606
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,419
it will only choose one because it is

607
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:29,039
used it is enough to uh to carry the

608
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,740
information that the modular difference

609
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,440
of Z equals to the module difference of

610
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,720
a and one then we then we need to uh

611
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,799
deal with them

612
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,500
and then we will yeah we will get still

613
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,320
get one possible value of the sign

614
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,440
difference of B5 then

615
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,840
so what do we do many steps are

616
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,020
deterministic but what do we what we

617
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,600
need is the sign difference of A5 so we

618
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,899
will expand this sine difference to get

619
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,120
the second difference of XR so maybe if

620
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,559
you have a confused value if you're not

621
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,940
yes familiar with this reaction so

622
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,580
if we carefully analyze uh what we

623
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,600
really do in the hand we will know

624
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,020
uh uh we we need to

625
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,200
deal with these three problems so the

626
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,380
first problem is how to describe how to

627
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,440
compute a unique sign difference to

628
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,899
capture the propagation of the modular

629
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,279
difference through the modular Edition

630
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,520
and the second why is how to model the

631
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,500
sun difference propagates to the Boolean

632
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,779
function and the second one is how to

633
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,440
the last step how to expand this

634
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,360
understanding difference so that we can

635
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,899
get but many possible Sun differences

636
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,940
such that their modular difference are

637
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,960
same

638
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,539
so inside the difference there are three

639
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,020
stages uh and you equal where m means

640
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,840
the B is changed from 0 to 1 and u means

641
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,360
the uh the bit is changed from one to

642
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,880
zero and equal means yeah there's no

643
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,779
change

644
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,260
so we have we indeed tried several

645
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,760
methods to describe these three status

646
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,419
but we finally find that it's

647
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:20,340
it's better to use two binary variables

648
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,279
but we also uh restrict that these two

649
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,500
binary variables can only take values

650
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,519
from these steps so we because 0 0 and

651
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,120
1y indeed carry the same information

652
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,360
which means uh there is no difference in

653
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,679
this page

654
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,519
then that means slightly go through how

655
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,720
we did it so yes indeed quite simple if

656
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,580
we we know how to

657
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,399
have this big big picture in our minds

658
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,500
so we just need to proceed uh perceive

659
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,200
the time difference transitions bit by

660
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,799
bit and what we need to do is to give

661
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,500
the propagation rules for uh the

662
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,260
scientific Transitions and according to

663
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,480
our description for the sign difference

664
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,940
we can simply convert the propagation

665
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,460
rules into a choose table for the uh I

666
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,460
mean for the variables describing the

667
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,500
sign difference and then we can again

668
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,399
use the software logic Friday to get the

669
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,320
corresponding the Improvement linear

670
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,300
inequalities describing the truth table

671
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,540
and so this is the

672
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,859
[Music]

673
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:37,020
linear equality system so we are the

674
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,659
coefficients that this yeah this is we

675
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,599
can simply come against such a matrix

676
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,159
and similarly uh so how to model

677
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,520
uh the expensive of the sign difference

678
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,239
uh note that all we need to do is to get

679
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,820
all possible sign difference from a

680
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,440
giving signing difference that their

681
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,359
modular difference are same

682
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,099
so again we

683
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,599
yeah we can do this

684
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,060
so with some propagation address so

685
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,440
and there is indeed we can indeed

686
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,260
interpret this as traversing a tree it's

687
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,060
indeed like a tree structure for example

688
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,820
here there are branches but there is no

689
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,760
Branch if we if we check these

690
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,619
propagations well you will see no

691
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,720
branches

692
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,140
so yeah and for the Boolean functions

693
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,020
again yeah very soon we get the

694
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,280
propagation reverse for this uh bits and

695
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,440
we get the choose table and we get the

696
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,839
linear Quality Systems yeah okay and

697
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,440
but we have not yet considered the

698
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,480
contradictions in the conditions how to

699
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,440
do it so first uh the first

700
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
first we need to deal with the

701
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,220
contributions in the Boolean functions

702
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,880
so we simply

703
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,619
introduce

704
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,020
XYZ representing the values into the

705
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,960
model so here so this means the sign

706
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,780
difference but this means the value and

707
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,579
we construct a much larger table to

708
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,859
discover all valid couples

709
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,099
so all valuable values of this turbo is

710
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,859
a bit long but it's useful to detect the

711
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,440
contradictions in the cooling function

712
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,599
but not yet over because we still have

713
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,619
contradictions in the queue so yeah this

714
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,960
is indeed a bit involving and you have

715
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,480
to refer to one of my paper at asia5

716
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,500
2017 and we finally found that these

717
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,760
three equations are sufficient to uh to

718
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,000
to detect the contradictions in it so

719
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,599
indeed this is not a very easy problem

720
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,859
there are many other Minor Details and

721
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,760
yeah so I cannot introduce all of them

722
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,680
in this short presentation and uh and

723
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,700
also I mean to increase the flexibility

724
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,359
of our model we also have many optional

725
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,400
parameters to control the searching

726
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,440
structures in our model so you can check

727
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,560
it out so and we apply this to fmd and

728
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,220
get some new attacks on 6 60 36 runs

729
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,339
but but questions quickly advice which

730
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,680
is is this technique really useful and

731
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,380
efficient because we have the powerful

732
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,720
gas and determining technique okay thank

733
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,380
you really beat this technique and we do

734
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,300
not we we did not answer this question

735
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,700
in our in this paper but in our

736
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,420
follow-up paper my college ishin did

737
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,820
some amazing work and he showed yeah

738
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,240
this method can indeed beat the gas and

739
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,280
determined technique in some sense by

740
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,440
giving the first semi-free structures

741
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,700
for certain micro 256 and this updates

742
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,060
the best records are Mendoza after 10

743
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,380
years

744
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,079
of because they cannot find such a

745
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,760
differential chair

746
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,940
in summary we propose an alternative

747
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
method to find sign differential

748
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,020
characteristics for the Indonesia hash

749
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,099
family

750
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,680
this is very new and it's the first

751
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,900
attempt maybe we can improve its

752
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,579
efficiency with some

753
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,400
other strategies and also over there

754
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,260
should be there can be more applications

755
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,599
of these techniques for example Chateau

756
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,359
is very important and this used

757
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,839
worldwide so we should Target and so the

758
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,359
code is also open source so guys thank

759
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,260
you

760
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,060
uh yeah

761
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,090
[Applause]

762
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,799
any questions for the speaker

763
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,740
so uh just a quick question maybe you

764
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,200
missed it what is the complexity of the

765
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,859
the attacks roughly uh for our attack

766
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,960
for the sixth

767
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,920
a 36 run the time complex is 2 to the

768
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,000
64. but

769
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,579
now we have updated

770
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:21,720
first

771
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,160
hopefullying for 40 rounds okay

772
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,040
easy so it did yeah very nice yeah very

773
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,900
nice

774
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,630
okay so uh let's thank the speaker again

775
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:40,949
[Applause]

776
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,640
so uh the final paper in the session is

777
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,099
called the Collision effects on round

778
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,859
reduced shot three using conditional

779
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:08,760
internal differentials and the paper is

780
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,720
by a zombie Zhang

781
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,619
chain gun who and michen View and the

782
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,640
zombie is going to give the talk

783
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,520
thanks for the introduction

784
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,720
good morning everyone I'm welcome from

785
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,820
Institute of information engineering

786
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,300
Chinese Academy of Sciences my face a

787
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,460
great pleasure to be here with you my

788
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,380
topic is Collision attacks and one

789
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,800
reduce accessory using conditional

790
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,140
internal difference differentials this

791
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,359
work was done together with Junior info

792
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,720
and my supervisor meeting new

793
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,099
my talk will be in my divided into these

794
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,579
aspects let's start with the background

795
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,339
of hash function and architect and the

796
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,260
free verse work and also our

797
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,220
contribution

798
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,599
is assembly

799
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,760
mathematical emblem that makes

800
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,680
amsterdaments input to fix the lens

801
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,480
debate output

802
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,820
in cryptographic domain has functions

803
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,660
through the center file several security

804
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,119
property one of them is correlation

805
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,760
resistance which is that it should be

806
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,460
hard to find two messages that are

807
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,660
distinct I'm an employer and such that

808
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,339
these two messages through the

809
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,740
contribution of first functions will

810
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,579
lead to the Sim output

811
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:47,220
in our work we focus on relation attack

812
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,540
this is a short introduction of chat

813
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,560
after mb5 and 7 was written needs to

814
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,780
open the sales refresh function

815
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,540
completion in 2007

816
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,700
and the kitchen was submitted to

817
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,839
accessory Communication in 2010 page

818
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,599
these designers are Brittany near me

819
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,839
Peters and also after four years to

820
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,359
check became the winner

821
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,859
and in 2015 it was standalized by niche

822
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,579
as just read three has six versions

823
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,920
including four class functions and the

824
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,500
two extendable output functions

825
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,859
to check adopt the response construction

826
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:36,720
Sun construction as a framework for

827
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,520
constructing a hot function

828
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,599
from connotation it utilize baby to

829
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,359
analyze implementation to check f f

830
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:52,200
contains 24 runs there are two printers

831
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
with r and

832
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,119
CTC the sum of R and C is B

833
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,480
a message and also a database suggest

834
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,319
so so before processing the message is

835
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,480
repeated and is installed into arbit

836
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,839
blocks each block is exported to the

837
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,520
first arbiter

838
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,280
and uh before applying yes

839
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:22,520
an internal state of

840
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,500
1600 base which can be seen as a five

841
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,260
times five Matrix where each cell is a

842
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,859
64 page line in the direction of the the

843
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,500
axis its run function R contained

844
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,619
consists of five steps six row Pi Pi and

845
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,119
Alpha and the first three steps is

846
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,380
defined by L the linear layer uh Kai is

847
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,599
the only non-linear operation the figure

848
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,800
on the right is

849
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,440
show some Notions

850
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,300
determined by the designers

851
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,400
okay this is the one function of the

852
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,819
chat in every step it will add the one

853
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,740
wrong Defender constant to the first

854
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,520
line to destroy the Symmetry it can't be

855
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,099
ignored in internal differential

856
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:20,000
equation analysis

857
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,680
now let's see the previous work and our

858
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,260
contribution we utilize internal

859
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,819
differential crypto numbers which is

860
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,680
which were developed by Thomas pairing

861
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,980
in crypto

862
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,560
2010 and generalized by dinner the

863
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,339
information in the analysis of check in

864
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,599
the paper of SSC 2013

865
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,359
Dana at all

866
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,020
utilize these techniques such as squeeze

867
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,700
attack

868
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
internal differential Capital City

870
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,140
and reproposure

871
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,319
practical attacks are three round check

872
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,599

256 and foreign 384.

878
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,940
he

879
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,300
the major contribution in our work is

880
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,819
that we utilize

881
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:33,319
between additional internal difference

882
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:36,800
to propose Collision attacks

883
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,140
up to five run of six

884
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,079
six three versions in particular for

885
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,440
four round accessory

886
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,900
512 and

887
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,380
5006-256 the complexity are achieved

888
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,160
to to

889
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,920
237 and

890
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,579
to to 185

891
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:06,000
okay the second part is an overview of

892
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,260
the attack

893
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,260
during our study uh internal

894
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,960
differential analysis we found that it

895
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,940
can be viewed as a variant of burst

896
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,819
attack for uh for the general versus the

897
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,920
attack assume that the hash function H

898
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,400
makes y input subset to one output the

899
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,660
subset B of size total power ring so to

900
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,780
find the Collision we need about to to

901
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,040
the power of half our imposed from us

902
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,000
for a variant of versus attack assume a

903
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,880
fast function H maths input subset s to

904
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,960
multiple output success B1 B2 until D2

905
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,240
to the power key which is called the

906
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,119
service are called Collision success and

907
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,859
each size the size of each the chair is

908
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,500
2 to the power of M so to find a

909
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,900
collision

910
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,140
uh we need about 2 to the power of half

911
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,339
of M plus key imposed from s for this

912
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,400
type of attack we can perform parallel

913
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,920
research module

914
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,339
subset e and b i

915
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,480
since each the size of ucdi is similar

916
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,160
than d

917
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,599
we need the similar first table size

918
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,940
okay

919
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,099
let's briefly introduce the internal

920
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,319
differential analysis

921
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,260
for standard standard differential

922
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,780
computer analysis we consider message

923
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,480
pairs which make up a pair of states and

924
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,060
we consider the evolution

925
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,800
of difference

926
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,980
between the two states however the

927
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,300
internal differential equivalent

928
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,240
analysis we have only one

929
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,920
single state and divide it in two parts

930
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,180
we

931
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,420
are checking the difference between the

932
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,300
two parts of a single state

933
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,579
for generalized internal differential

934
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,500
product analysis we consider more

935
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,819
complexity

936
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,040
a different

937
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,880
so different solutions between multiple

938
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,060
parts of a single state and consider the

939
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,880
evolution

940
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,000
for conditional internal differential

941
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,760
equivalent analysis we can find the

942
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,920
messages confirming to run the internal

943
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,440
differential operator received by adding

944
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,319
linear conditions to the initial initial

945
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,700
status phase

946
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,819
okay let's see a special type

947
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,400
of states which

948
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,520
could be for the symmetrical States

949
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,020
it's one statement Paradise in the axis

950
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,859
as soon the following formula it is

951
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,380
called a symmetric State since the

952
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,319
fundamental period corresponding to I is

953
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,020
the greatest common divisor of I under

954
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,339
64. I can attain non-fire values

955
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,400
here is an example for a symmetric state

956
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,140
with

957
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,779
I equal to 16.

958
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,540
okay this is a property of symmetry

959
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,760
States in key check

960
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,579
which is at a semester studies will

961
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:34,740
maintains metric after applying the

962
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,160
first four operations of okay check if

963
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,040
we start with a symmetric State and

964
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,260
apply any of the first four segmentings

965
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,500
we will end up with another symmetric

966
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,740
state

967
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,760
okay let's introduce the internal

968
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,000
difference says

969
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,800
research by adding a single state a

970
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,960
single representative

971
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,599
State reach or symmetric States is an

972
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,540
internal difference set which is called

973
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,640
internal difference for short

974
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,819
if we is a zero Vector the difference is

975
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,520
zero the internal difference is zero

976
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,980
internal difference which is exactly the

977
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,960
set of all symmetrical states with pair

978
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,880
with I

979
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,400
uh finally in the similar to the case of

980
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,260
question groups the action of linear

981
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,020
matching uh any internal difference is

982
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,900
equivalent to acting on the

983
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,800
representative state

984
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,280
okay this is a framework of the attack

985
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,780
for foreign

986
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,280
state

987
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,800
then calculate the internal difference

988
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,680
of M after three months of one function

989
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,980
and the store the state into a subset

990
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,520
finally calculator the creation subset

991
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,800
of each subset I reaches V in turn into

992
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,500
one Collision is one

993
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,040
for five run the Collision attack

994
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,099
we choose two block messages and the

995
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,200
employed

996
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,640
targeted internal difference evidence

997
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,680
Tida

998
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,380
to complete the first step

999
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,900
and in the following two steps

1000
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,839
which just

1001
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,619
had a extra in the region of run

1002
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:57,780
functions and

1003
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,720
the framework is similar to the forerun

1004
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,319
localization attack

1005
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,400
next we will introduce the basic

1006
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,079
techniques of these three problems

1007
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,540
this is the third part

1008
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,000
first how to estimate a transition

1009
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,740
probability or internal difference

1010
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,200
let's introduce the differential

1011
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,380
transition conditions given the input

1012
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,020
difference 13 of keychain Xbox the

1013
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,119
outputed difference start out is

1014
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,599
determined by Q linear conditions which

1015
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,140
is donated as differential transition

1016
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,760
conditions

1017
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,300
the dirt out is represented by the

1018
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,559
following formula which ensures the

1019
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,339
correctness of definition above

1020
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:57,960
we also determine Define the difference

1021
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,839
conditions table DCT and values of

1022
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,780
different conditions people V ECT

1023
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,359
based on the definition of transition

1024
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:09,480
conditions now we can estimate the

1025
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,400
transition probability of internal

1026
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
difference the rank of linear equation

1027
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,339
system e composed of all differential

1028
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,619
generation conditions of an internal

1029
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,839
difference is the transition condition

1030
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,540
number the transition probability is

1031
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,700
lower bounded by 2 to the power of

1032
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,880
negative two t where T is the

1033
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,040
generalization

1034
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,058
condition number

1035
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,040
okay next we will introduce how to find

1036
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,220
the messages confirming to run the

1037
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,040
internal differential operators mistake

1038
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,240
after giving a

1039
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,760
internal differential capitalistic

1040
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,460
assume that the symmetric States of

1041
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,819
each internal difference x y z w

1042
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,099
respectively

1043
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:06,300
so our goal is to find X such that Y and

1044
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,099
W satisfy the

1045
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:12,420
respective differential transition

1046
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,420
conditions e0 and E1

1047
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,760
and finding Y is easy because y can be

1048
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,140
represented by LX we just need to uh

1049
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:30,420
submitted data into e0 0 and solve rate

1050
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,579
for x

1051
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:37,740
for U1 we should linearize each VI in V1

1052
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,460
such that E1 W is a linear equation

1053
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,839
system in x

1054
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,900
okay finally we will

1055
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,220
introduce the target internal difference

1056
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,339
exam

1057
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:56,099
Tida the targeted difference of them was

1058
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:00,420
introduced by binary and summary and

1059
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,559
divided into

1060
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,599
in our work we separate the difference

1061
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,900
fees and value fees and the way you

1062
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,700
reduce the number of Integrations for

1063
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,920
the two physics

1064
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,660
okay after solving the three problems

1065
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,319
combined name is

1066
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:27,599
given internal

1067
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,839
differential capitalistic we can obtain

1068
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:35,960
our results this is the last part

1069
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:41,280
here are the patent results and

1070
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,900
the internal differential

1071
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,200
characteristics parameters we used

1072
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,599
we can find that the

1073
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:53,780
small period I will lead to small

1074
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,780
complexity and also reduce the degree of

1075
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,220
freedom

1076
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,420
to

1077
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,819
so

1078
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:05,460
we'll first need to ensure there are

1079
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,599
enough categories of freedom to generate

1080
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,099
uh at a list

1081
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:12,240
uh

1082
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,900
uh pleasing

1083
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,300
okay this is a summary on the future

1084
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,059
work in this paper we utilize

1085
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,339
conditional interrupt differential to

1086
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,440
find the collisions for up to five

1087
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,000
rounds of all accessory functions

1088
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,579
anyway proposed the further Collision

1089
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:37,800
attacks for one of and five runs 256

1090
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,520
and achieve the best pollution attack on

1091
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,180
foreign 512

1092
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,619
for the future work and interesting work

1093
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,260
is to find better internal differential

1094
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,280
capitalistic another word is apply

1095
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,980
internal differential and emphasize to

1096
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,740
other ciphers

1097
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,400
okay that concludes my transition thank

1098
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,510
you for your attention

1099
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:13,980
[Applause]

1100
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,880
any questions

1101
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,260
uh can you please approach the

1102
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,619
microphone

1103
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,400
so just to clear it up because I don't

1104
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,660
exactly have a background in

1105
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,760
differential Crypts analysis and bits

1106
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,160
and Views but so you mentioned um you

1107
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,280
solve different conditions well this uh

1108
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,760
different condition tables right

1109
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,980
yes these

1110
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,300
say two different conditions people so

1111
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,920
uh previously we heard about different

1112
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,540
distribution tables in one of the

1113
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,819
previous talks uh yesterday are these

1114
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:04,380
the same things with different names or

1115
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,059
is there a difference between the two

1116
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,700
sorry I

1117
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,180
the

1118
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,920
so basically a different distribution

1119
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,260
table basically tells you given a

1120
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,359
characteristic what's the probability of

1121
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,339
a transition happening

1122
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:26,700
so is it the same thing here or is it

1123
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,720
like different to how does this work

1124
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,399
I don't know the difference between her

1125
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,619
okay no worries and maybe we can

1126
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:40,619
communicators

1127
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,160
any more questions

1128
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,380
okay so if not then let's take the

1129
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,180
speaker and all the speakers of the

1130
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,419
session

1131
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:04,819
foreign
