models along with traffic also Cerny

173
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,440
Alkali is an influential work

174
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,740
the past decade has became the basis of

175
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,120
Designing

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
um concretely efficient snarks which are

177
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,880
instrumental in bridging efficiency in

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,940
privacy in blockchains

179
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,399
guy also made influential contributions

180
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
in the field of privacy and differential

181
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,220
privacy his work with Moritz heart

182
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,740
on multiplayer multiplicative weights

183
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,260
mechanism remains remains a significant

184
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,839
approach to dealing with a large number

185
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,019
of statistical queries

186
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,720
besides these guys had made important

187
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,760
contributions to learning obfuscation

188
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
fairness and realizing the future me

189
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,420
arrested

190
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,240
and he's a fantastic speaker

191
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,220
in this talk he will discuss

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,019
indistinguishable predictions and

193
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,000
multi-group thread learning so without

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,820
further Ado let's welcome guy

195
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,940
[Applause]

196
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,100
thank you and thanks commit for that

197
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,560
lovely introduction and now there's

198
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,000
nothing left to do but disappoint you

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,500
after such an introduction okay so um

200
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,899
I wanted to speak about work that I've

201
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,060
been doing with some collaborators in

202
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,640
recent years about fairness in machine

203
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,620
learning and automated prediction and

204
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,019
also thinking about the meaning of

205
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,459
predicting

206
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,920
uh individual probabilities in machine

207
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,140
Learning Systems we'll talk about it and

208
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,000
one thing I want to get across right

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,100
from the beginning is that we've taken a

210
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,660
very cryptographic or cryptographically

211
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,240
inspired approach to these problems and

212
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,339
these are really important problems uh

213
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,380
so I hope you know if you see something

214
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,240
you like or if you see something you

215
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,220
don't like that you will also join the

216
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,720
research effort

217
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,980
um thinking about these questions

218
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,240
um and I should say because Apple asked

219
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,980
me to say that this is mostly work that

220
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,680
I did before joining Apple

221
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,540
um okay

222
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,540
so predictive algorithms we know are

223
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,279
everywhere and they're only becoming

224
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,200
more and more prevalent in society and

225
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
more and more influential I really love

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,839
this New Yorker cartoon

227
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,720
can you see the pointer or not so much

228
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,820
okay yeah so I love this New Yorker

229
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,320
cartoon you know algorithms are

230
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,779
determining who our life are influencing

231
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,019
who we meet for our life partners of

232
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,060
course are also influencing decisions

233
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,339
that are made about us in medicine in

234
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,220
the finance system every time you apply

235
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,320
for a loan for example in criminal

236
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,380
justice if you ever need to come up in

237
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,820
the U.S criminal justice system up

238
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,920
against a judge

239
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,120
um there's a good chance that an

240
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,920
algorithm will

241
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,260
be advising or helping that judge make a

242
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,579
decision about you

243
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,100
so really these are hugely consequential

244
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,260
decisions being made about individuals

245
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,600
at skills that we couldn't really

246
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,360
conceive of I think even in the recent

247
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,339
um past and it's only going to get more

248
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,800
so in the future

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,720
and there are many advantages to

250
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,279
automated prediction for example you

251
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,660
know if they can make a better medical

252
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,880
diagnosis than a doctor or do that at a

253
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
scale that a human doctor cannot do that

254
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,420
can be tremendously beneficial but

255
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,240
they're also very serious concerns and a

256
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,339
prominent concern is fairness of the

257
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,260
predictions it's not the only concern

258
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,760
that I'll talk about today but it's a

259
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,820
prominent concern and I pulled up some

260
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,519
headlines yesterday

261
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,680
When I Was preparing this when I was

262
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,779
finishing the slides

263
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:55,920
um

264
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
some horror stories and really what

265
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,339
seems to get the most press is when

266
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,079
there are discrimination issues with

267
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,240
algorithmic predictions so these are

268
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,100
some examples from the world of hiring

269
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,220
from medical risk prediction and for the

270
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,779
criminal justice system in the United

271
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,000
States uh there are some excellent

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,620
literature that I really recommend you

273
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,200
check out recently algorithms of

274
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,760
Oppression or weapons of math

275
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,579
destruction really good literature

276
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,420
detailing these types of uh concerns so

277
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,800
that's what I want to talk about today

278
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,899
and I think the challenge for us as

279
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,579
computer scientists and as

280
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,820
cryptographers is can we come up with a

281
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
principled reasoned mathematical way of

282
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,320
thinking about these kinds of problems

283
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,120
and concerns and can we find a way to

284
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,279
handle them to mitigate them to get the

285
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,839
benefits of machine Learning Without

286
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,680
some of the really devastating Harms

287
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,800
okay so I want to start right off by

288
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,940
saying that I'm going to talk about

289
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,459
prediction but no one really knows what

290
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,540
they're talking about when they talk

291
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,459
about prediction when we have a

292
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,959
predictor usually they're called risk

293
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,240
predictors they try to assign a number

294
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
between zero and one

295
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,459
to an individual instance okay maybe we

296
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,260
have some measurements about the climate

297
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,120
and we want to predict the probability

298
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
it will rain tomorrow so the algorithm

299
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,839
spits out a number between zero and one

300
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,880
the number is understood as a

301
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
probability but that's a problematic

302
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,779
interpretation as we'll see another

303
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,880
example we have a loan applicant with

304
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,500
certain features X what's the

305
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,300
probability that we they will repay the

306
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,760
loan that they're applying for

307
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,560
given some Medical Imaging what's the

308
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
probability that this tumor whose

309
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,620
Imaging we're looking at will

310
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,899
metastasize

311
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,820
what's the probability that a defendant

312
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,440
with a certain set of features y will

313
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,880
commit a violent crime if we release

314
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,700
them on bail okay so these are important

315
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
questions we would love to know these

316
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,300
probabilities I think that could be

317
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,360
really World altering if we could but

318
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,980
notice that all of these events are

319
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,660
non-repeatable the tumor will

320
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,420
metastasize or it won't write the loan

321
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,459
applicant will either repay the loan or

322
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,380
they won't

323
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,180
the defendant will commit a violent

324
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,639
crime or they won't we don't get to

325
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,620
rerun the experiment we just get to see

326
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,440
an outcome zero or one so you know maybe

327
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,959
I got a probability of 0.8 of repaying

328
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,060
the loan then I did or I didn't

329
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,220
what's the probability over what do

330
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,720
these probabilities we're trying to get

331
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,060
at mean and that's a deep question that

332
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,519
you know has sort of been uh handled by

333
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,019
statistics and the forecast testing

334
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,880
literature for decades and we're not

335
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,620
going to answer it today but I think by

336
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,839
the end of the talk hopefully we'll get

337
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,240
a very cryptographic new perspective or

338
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,740
a new approach to thinking about the

339
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,940
meaning of these individual

340
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,040
probabilities

341
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
now the probabilities are particularly

342
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,579
problematic because of concerns like

343
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,560
fairness so I wanted to say a little bit

344
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,120
about fairness before we delve into

345
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,380
things

346
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,540
so these algorithms are not operating in

347
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,519
a vacuum they're operating on people on

348
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,399
individuals with a certain context in a

349
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,860
certain Society behind them and the

350
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,540
population includes minorities that are

351
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,820
protected either by law by ethics by

352
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,100
policy

353
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,199
fairness is important and it's not a new

354
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,060
concern fairness you know the study of

355
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,760
fairness in various contexts is has been

356
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,440
going on for millennia

357
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,260
spanning many disciplines but the types

358
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,480
of problems we are being tasked with now

359
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,220
are new and they come from computer

360
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,800
science and you I think you can't really

361
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,079
reason about them without taking a

362
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,579
computer science perspective so computer

363
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,560
science is part of the problem and it

364
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
also has to be a part of the solution

365
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,100
and there's a whole field now of

366
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,079
algorithmic fairness that tries to

367
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,880
reason about the fairness of decisions

368
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,940
or predictions being made by algorithms

369
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,279
with the hope that algorithms can make

370
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
Equitable decisions but I just want to

371
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,040
say

372
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,540
and I have to say it although I think

373
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,519
with this point hopefully it's obvious

374
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
to everyone if you just train a machine

375
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,899
learning algorithm on data drawn from

376
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,760
society and ask it to make predictions

377
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,399
it is not going to be fair on its own

378
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,320
okay it's going to be biased because the

379
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
data are biased because it's trying to

380
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,279
optimize for the general population not

381
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,959
for minorities because sometimes it's

382
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,480
trained with the wrong objective

383
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,279
so we really need to think about these

384
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,680
things deeply

385
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
and ideally what we would want again

386
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,220
thinking about this as a cryptographer

387
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,839
well I would want a mathematical

388
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,820
definition of fairness similar to the

389
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,440
way we have a definition of semantic

390
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
security for encryption and we have

391
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,560
stronger definitions and we have a

392
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,300
definition like differential privacy for

393
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,579
privacy preserving data analysis and I

394
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,320
would similarly want to write an

395
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
equation telling you mathematically here

396
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,519
is what fairness in the world means and

397
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,779
then we would make sure that all the

398
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,180
algorithms we use satisfy the equation

399
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,459
and we would be happy

400
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,440
I think that's a good hope unfortunately

401
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,899
fairness seems to be a lot trickier than

402
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,540
things I've worked on like encryption or

403
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,940
uh privacy preserving data analysis

404
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,339
fairness is very context dependent so

405
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,860
for example targeting

406
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,839
um women and men differently if you're

407
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,300
advertising a shampoo

408
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,240
it's usually not problematic whereas if

409
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,139
you're targeting men and women

410
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,480
differently in a hiring ad for a job

411
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,600
that's illegal in many countries

412
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,639
so it's very dependent on context and

413
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,339
societal Norms it's very subtle actually

414
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,260
even just auditing understanding whether

415
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,179
what's going on in a system is fair or

416
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,579
not let alone devising a fair system can

417
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,679
be very problematic

418
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,119
but

419
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,160
um I've decided to not be depressed

420
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,319
about this but rather to be happy about

421
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,299
this

422
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,559
um and thinking about this as

423
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,059
cryptographers I think it's a huge

424
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,160
opportunity and the opportunity is you

425
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,419
know we're not going to probably we're

426
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,799
not going to get away with finding just

427
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,080
one definition but we have the

428
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,000
delightful or I'd want to say delightful

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,559
because some of the things you encounter

430
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,760
when you work on fairness are really

431
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,860
troubling but we have the exciting job

432
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,480
of

433
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,080
um understanding what the threats are

434
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,600
cataloging you know concerns and coming

435
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
up with counter measures for particular

436
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,260
contexts that are of interest and you

437
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,520
know we'll have a whole family of

438
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,860
hopefully of definitions and algorithms

439
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,780
and counter measures and techniques and

440
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,100
I think that's the goal at least for the

441
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,780
theoretical study of algorithmic

442
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,860
fairness

443
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,559
okay so that's back that's a backdrop

444
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,760
for what I want to tell you about today

445
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,919
I want to talk about

446
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,500
um how to make predictions meaningful so

447
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,640
what does it mean when we're predicting

448
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,380
an individual probability and how can we

449
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,580
think about it

450
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,620
and we have a new framework very much

451
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,240
inspired by cryptography that we call

452
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,400
outcome in distinguishability a new

453
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,039
Criterion definition deciderata for

454
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,900
prediction

455
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,120
that will help us to understand to think

456
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,559
about

457
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,100
um predicting One-Shot events and we'll

458
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,860
see that it's I think it's

459
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,820
interesting in its own right and it's

460
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,799
also going to be very helpful for

461
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,080
achieving fairness and strong Notions of

462
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
fairness and hopefully I'll have time to

463
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,919
tell you about both of those

464
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,240
um today

465
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,940
okay so let's start off with our setting

466
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,799
these individual probabilities we've

467
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,260
said it's very problematic we predict a

468
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,840
probability of 0.7 of rain either it

469
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,460
will rain or not

470
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,620
we don't get to observe the underlying

471
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,679
true probability of rain according to

472
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,700
Nature

473
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,020
or

474
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,299
similar for loan defendants or for loan

475
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,700
applicants or criminal defendants in

476
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,440
fact we don't even know dozens this is a

477
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
philosophical question right does

478
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,620
uncertainty even exist I mean what is

479
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,960
0.7 maybe you know if I knew the state

480
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
of all the particles in the universe and

481
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
I had a sufficiently strong Computing

482
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,780
device I could just compute everything

483
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,120
you know is it going to rain is this

484
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,679
defendant going to commit a violent

485
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,120
crime

486
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,760
um

487
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
so you know are there probabilities what

488
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
is this 0.7 trying to capture I think

489
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,179
colloquially it's trying to capture

490
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,700
okay given what we know and given sort

491
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,100
of similar instances what should we

492
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
expect to happen but that's a very

493
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,780
loosey-goosey sort of definition

494
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,400
so let's try to make it a little more

495
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,600
precise

496
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
so what I want to think about throughout

497
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,960
the talk today is what's known in

498
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,940
machine learning is the batch setting so

499
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,700
we have an underlying distribution

500
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,919
usually we call that nature

501
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,299
I can't see my pointer but maybe you can

502
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,500
we call that nature and we get to see

503
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,419
observations every observation is a set

504
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,520
of features X you know maybe the

505
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,320
features of a loan applicant and an

506
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,679
outcome why I usually call it y star the

507
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,299
star indicates that this is nature this

508
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,700
is this is being governed by reality y

509
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,260
star of X and we get to see a Boolean

510
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,000
outcome you know did the person repay

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,460
the loan or not

512
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,799
and I'm assuming that the distribution

513
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,660
for the talk today the distribution is

514
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,120
static and we are seeing examples drawn

515
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,679
from it we don't get to see the same

516
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,240
person twice but the distribution

517
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,799
nonetheless

518
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,440
is the same is is fixed

519
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,120
and now once we have this distribution

520
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,380
in mind

521
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,360
we can Define what we mean when we say

522
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,100
individual probability what I really

523
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,140
want is the probability for this

524
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,580
particular person with this set of

525
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,919
features x what is the probability of

526
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,419
the outcome being one under the

527
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,940
distribution d right that is the correct

528
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,740
individual probability which I'll call P

529
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,160
star of X in the talk today

530
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,580
so for example maybe nature or P star we

531
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,320
have all these green people and each of

532
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,140
them has a probability of exactly 0.5 of

533
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,360
Fair coin toss of being a zero having an

534
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,640
outcome zero or an outcome one and when

535
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,260
we start drawing examples we start

536
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,419
observing reality we see some of these

537
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,400
people's people get an outcome of one

538
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,380
some of them get an outcome

539
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,500
of zero okay and I wanna I'm gonna say

540
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,059
it a million times and talk today but

541
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm gonna say it a million times because

542
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,240
it's important

543
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
um we only get to observe the outcomes

544
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,919
what the true probability of an

545
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,320
individual is is unknowable and you know

546
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,020
we might have deep philosophical

547
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,700
disagreements about about what it is or

548
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,260
whether there is

549
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,580
um Randomness whether everything should

550
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,600
we should be thinking of it's

551
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,360
deterministic we only get to observe um

552
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,419
the outcomes we don't know what P star

553
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,539
itself is okay and that raises this

554
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,460
problem which I've been hinting at we've

555
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,080
taken to calling it the unresolvability

556
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,659
problem do probabilities exist do they

557
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,640
not exist

558
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,100
suppose I tell you that I think P star

559
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,380
really the true probability is governing

560
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,799
reality are 0.5 for everyone

561
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,480
now there are two indistinguishable

562
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,440
worlds maybe it's 0.5 for everyone or

563
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,559
maybe it's one for a say a random subset

564
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,000
of the individuals maybe there's some

565
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
feature we don't have that would tell us

566
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,000
who the ones are and who the zeros are

567
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,860
but as far as we see now there's a

568
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,480
random subset of the people who are one

569
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,280
in a random subset of the people who are

570
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,559
zero according to P star there's no

571
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,120
probability and we're just seeing

572
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,220
deterministic outcomes we can't tell

573
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,480
these are two indistinguishable

574
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,460
realities

575
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
so when I tell you that a probability is

576
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,380
0.5 or 0.7 what does that mean how can

577
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,360
we reason about how good or accurate

578
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,640
these probabilities are if we can never

579
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,840
agree on whether things are

580
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,700
probabilistic or deterministic in the

581
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,059
first place

582
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,980
okay so of course I didn't invent this

583
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,179
problem this is a problem that machine

584
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,740
learning people and statisticians have

585
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,780
been dealing with for decades so what

586
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,539
are some approaches for evaluating

587
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,820
predictions probabilistic predictions so

588
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,140
the prevalent approach in machine

589
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,520
learning is what's known as loss

590
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,039
minimization we Define some loss

591
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,020
function that tells us how close these

592
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,720
predictions are to the outcomes maybe

593
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,520
the squared loss the difference between

594
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,020
the predicted probability and the

595
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,820
outcome that we see squared or you could

596
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,799
take the absolute value but some

597
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,460
function that is hopefully shrinking as

598
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,600
the predictions are getting more

599
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
accurate and we try to minimize the loss

600
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,840
okay

601
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,520
so of course there's the question what

602
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
is a good loss now suppose I tell you

603
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,780
that the loss of the predictor is 0.3 on

604
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,080
average is it good is it bad if everyone

605
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,480
is a balanced coin toss and I give you a

606
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,659
loss of something like 0.25 in Square

607
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,460
law is that the perfect predictor will

608
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,260
actually have significant loss okay if

609
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,580
there's a lot of Randomness in the

610
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,799
system even a perfect predictor will

611
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,840
have significant loss and that's okay

612
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,400
there's Randomness in the system we

613
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,860
don't think we can do better than that

614
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,780
so the smaller the loss the better but

615
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,659
in many complex prediction tasks you

616
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,640
know predicting whether a defendant will

617
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,500
commit a crime predicting whether a loan

618
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,659
applicant will replay pay the loan there

619
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,940
is uncertainty as far as we can tell and

620
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,620
there will be loss another question of

621
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,140
what is a good predictor

622
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,640
I don't know what a good law says for

623
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,980
this particular task moreover the loss

624
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,900
is global it's an aggregate so maybe the

625
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,760
predictor is doing really really well on

626
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,380
the general population but doing poorly

627
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,400
on a minority we see that all the time

628
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,059
um

629
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,159
so last loss minimization on its own

630
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,480
doesn't really tell us whether the

631
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,159
predictions are meaningful it does give

632
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,720
us a way of ranking predictors right

633
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,400
like this predictor has less loss than

634
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
that predictor so maybe we like it

635
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,059
better but it doesn't tell us on our own

636
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,740
on its own whether a predictor is good

637
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,179
or what it means

638
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,280
the standard Approach at least in the

639
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,900
theory of machine learning and agnostic

640
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,880
learning is to show that the loss is

641
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,460
competitive the loss you're getting is

642
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,799
you know at least is no is better than

643
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,380
or not worse than the best decision tree

644
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,480
or the best neural net of a certain size

645
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,640
or the best regression

646
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,100
still is that good or is it not good is

647
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,380
a very subjective question okay the

648
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,880
other approach taken from the forecast

649
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,159
testing literature which is also plays a

650
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,080
role in modern machine learning is

651
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,700
what's known as calibration so these are

652
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,220
sort of Sanity checks for the predictor

653
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,140
for example if the predictor is

654
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,240
predicting 0.7 for a certain collection

655
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,220
of days right or a certain collection of

656
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,419
individuals

657
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,120
then if for 70 of the instances on which

658
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,159
the predictor predicted 0.7 the outcome

659
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,480
should be one

660
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,460
certainly if the predictor is giving us

661
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,260
the correct probabilities this should be

662
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,640
the case

663
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,159
right when it's predicting 0.7 should 70

664
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,960
of the time we should be seeing a one

665
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,000
but calibration on its own is pretty

666
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,260
weak right

667
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,480
suppose for example that it rains we

668
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,059
know that in Lyon it rains 30 of the

669
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,919
days I don't know if that's accurate or

670
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,279
not but I can just predict 0.3 for every

671
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,679
single day of the year in Leon and you

672
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,080
know 30 of the time it will rain 70 it

673
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,940
won't rain more or less and my predictor

674
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,260
is calibrated

675
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,640
but the predictions are not very

676
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,500
meaningful or informative right so

677
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,260
calibration is a good Criterion

678
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,419
but it can be achieved especially in the

679
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,520
batch setting sort of easily and again

680
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,140
it doesn't it tells us if a predictor is

681
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,820
not calibrated then we know something

682
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,039
bad is going on if I look at the places

683
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,799
where the predictor predicted 0.7 and I

684
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,600
see that they were never one

685
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,100
there was always zeros and something is

686
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,440
wrong with a predictor so if there's no

687
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,820
calibration there's a problem but

688
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,679
calibration on its own doesn't really

689
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,940
tell us

690
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,740
um how to you know if the predictions

691
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,260
are meaningful and so given a predictor

692
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,880
and I should have said it the predictor

693
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
throughout the talk today is going to be

694
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,200
P tilde so P star is the truth the true

695
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,659
probabilities P tilde is some predictor

696
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,640
that's being given to us and we want to

697
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,020
evaluate it

698
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,080
and how should we evaluate it

699
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,760
so I want to go back to this sort of

700
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,679
unresolvability question and think about

701
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,640
it from a cryptographic perspective

702
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,440
so suppose we see these observations and

703
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,299
we see a nature that we have ones and

704
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,000
zeros but I tell you now that the zeros

705
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
and the ones are completely

706
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,179
indistinguishable either because we

707
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,679
don't have the right features or because

708
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,620
you know they're pseudorandom or

709
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,700
um because of our computational

710
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,679
constraints there's just no way we can

711
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,840
distinguish the collection of people who

712
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,520
have outcome Zero from the collection of

713
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,740
people who have outcome one and you know

714
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,260
it's about 50 50. 50 of the people get a

715
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,140
zero fifty percent get a one

716
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,539
okay

717
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:26,340
so now we're in a situation where if I

718
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,020
hypothesize if we hypothesize that

719
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,120
nature gives everyone a 0.5 this

720
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,880
hypothesis is indistinguishable

721
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
from the reality

722
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,520
and for us I think it's cryptographers

723
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,320
we're pretty comfortable with this kind

724
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,940
of situation and in fact that's going to

725
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,320
be our goal

726
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
when we talk about outcome and

727
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,080
distinguishability we want to come up

728
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,779
with predictions that are

729
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,679
indistinguishable computationally

730
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,559
indistinguishable from the real from the

731
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,480
reality from the real outcomes that

732
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,760
we'll see okay

733
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,679
so this is a slide I really like from

734
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,120
Avi victorson when we talk about

735
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,400
Randomness Randomness is in the eye of

736
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,260
the beholder when we toss a coin we say

737
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,700
that if it's a fair coin there's a

738
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,559
probability a half of it coming up heads

739
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,140
and a half of coming up tails

740
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,260
in reality it might be the case that

741
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,179
when we toss the same coin if we pointed

742
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,340
you know a thousand different cameras at

743
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,799
it and ran a bunch of supercomputers

744
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,720
while the coin was in the air we could

745
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,460
determine whether it's going to be a

746
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,200
zero a heads or a Tails whether it's

747
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,820
going to come up heads or tails whether

748
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,580
the outcome is going to be zero or one

749
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,640
so really it's a question of

750
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,279
um information and computation power

751
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,860
and we're very comfortable with this and

752
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,299
assuming that we don't have a thousand

753
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,740
cameras to point at the coin and a

754
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,600
supercomputer to devote to this giving a

755
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,039
prediction of a half is

756
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,659
indistinguishable from the reality that

757
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,039
we're going to see and that's a pretty

758
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,840
good prediction

759
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,299
okay so I do want to make a little a

760
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,220
brief detour uh even though for this

761
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,360
audience

762
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,140
um I think computational

763
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,580
indistinguishability should be something

764
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,500
you're familiar with

765
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,880
still this is something that's coming

766
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,380
from the world of cryptography and

767
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,000
complexity Theory and when we talk about

768
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,400
indistinguishable distributions we mean

769
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,500
distributions that you know say a

770
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,020
pseudorandom distribution looks uniform

771
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,580
or distributions that look like each

772
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,500
other even though in reality if you look

773
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,299
at the L1 distance statistical distance

774
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,120
between them they could be far apart

775
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,760
so two distributions we say d0 and D1

776
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,760
are computationally indistinguishable if

777
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,919
for a large class of distinguishers

778
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,840
usually we think about every polynomial

779
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,880
time every feasible distinguisher that

780
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,320
we can run

781
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,840
if we feed a sample from d0 into the

782
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,539
distinguisher or a sample from D1 into

783
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,640
the distinguisher the distinguisher will

784
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,980
output the distincture output 0 or 1 and

785
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,600
it would all put one with approximately

786
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,100
the same probability

787
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,620
for every distinguisher so any procedure

788
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,840
say that you can run in polynomial time

789
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,520
we'll output one with the same

790
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,260
probability on these two distributions

791
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,600
and we say they're indistinguishable and

792
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,460
as far as we care in many in many

793
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,200
situations in cryptography the

794
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,820
distributions are interchangeable we

795
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,500
don't care about which one we use no one

796
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,940
will ever be able to tell the difference

797
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,860
between them

798
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,899
so with that in mind I want something

799
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,640
similar for a predictor I want

800
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
predictions that are indistinguishable

801
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,659
from reality and then I will be happy

802
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,240
okay so I'm thinking now about a

803
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,740
predictor that we're being presented

804
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,960
with Pete Tilda as a generative model

805
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,059
right ptailed as telling us how the

806
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,120
outcomes for every possible X

807
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,120
P tilde of X is going to tell us you

808
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,159
know is essentially giving us a model

809
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,500
it's positing that the outcome the

810
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,240
Boolean outcome for X is going to be

811
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,580
drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with

812
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,139
probability P tilde of x

813
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,720
um and we can talk here about two

814
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,580
realities you know maybe the reality is

815
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,039
as P tilde predicted so it predicted 0.5

816
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,200
for everyone and we have the reality on

817
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,720
the left in green

818
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,880
or maybe it's predicting 0.5 for

819
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,440
everyone but the reality is on the right

820
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,659
there's a random set of zeros and a

821
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,820
random set of ones a random subset of

822
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,399
zeros and a random subset of ones

823
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,679
and I want if the predictor the

824
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,840
predictor being uh outcome

825
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,340
indistinguishable means that no

826
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,440
distinguisher in a rich class can

827
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,960
distinguish these two situations so

828
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,820
outcomes drawn according to the

829
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,919
predictor and outcomes drawn according

830
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,840
to reality are indistinguishable

831
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,059
distributions to every distinguisher in

832
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,039
a very rich class say for now you can

833
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,419
think about any polynomial time

834
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,460
distinguisher

835
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,059
okay

836
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,580
so to make it a little bit more concrete

837
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,760
let why tilde be the predicted outcome

838
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,820
distribution okay so why tilde is

839
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,740
outcomes drawn according to P tilde

840
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,779
petel to say is saying 0.5 to everyone

841
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,020
so why tilde is a balanced coin

842
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,000
the distinguisher is either going to be

843
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,120
presented with the features X and the

844
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,460
prediction P tilde and an outcome drawn

845
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,980
according to P tilde 50 50 0 and more

846
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,940
one

847
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,039
or it's going to be presented with the

848
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,500
features X the prediction which is 0.5

849
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,520
and the real world outcome

850
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,080
and the distinguisher cannot tell which

851
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,120
is which

852
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,679
okay that's going to be the requirement

853
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,279
of outcome indistinguishability or oi

854
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,539
okay so I want that for every

855
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,940
distinguisher in a very rich class the

856
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,159
probability that it outputs one when the

857
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,600
outcomes are drawn according to the

858
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,340
predictor so this is a definition for

859
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,260
the predictor P tilde satisfies the

860
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,299
definition if for every distinguisher

861
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,940
the probability that it outputs one on

862
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,820
outcomes drawn according to P tilde is

863
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,200
the same as the probability that it

864
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,419
outputs one and probably on outcomes

865
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,340
drawn according to reality according to

866
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,320
P star

867
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,120
notice that P star itself does not

868
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,760
appear here we are not saying that P

869
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
tilde

870
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,779
the actual probability predicted 0.5 is

871
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,000
indistinguishable from predict from the

872
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,279
true probability P star

873
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,659
and it's for good reason first that

874
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,100
would be a hard definition to achieve

875
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,020
and second no one ever gets to see p

876
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,940
Star right we don't get to see what the

877
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,799
true correct probabilities are we just

878
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,580
see outcomes

879
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,899
um and two things to emphasize the

880
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,460
definition includes a class of

881
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,260
distinguishers so ideally we'd be

882
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,539
thinking about any feasible computation

883
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:15,360
any polynomial time computation but we

884
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,799
could be thinking about more restricted

885
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,260
classes of distinguishers as well

886
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,460
and there's also a particular

887
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,620
representation being fixed the feature

888
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,220
is X so maybe maybe if we had some extra

889
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,899
feature that we don't have at the moment

890
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,600
we could distinguish whether everyone is

891
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,480
a 0.5 or there's a set of zeros that we

892
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,640
can distinguish from a set of ones so

893
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,620
the features are also the information we

894
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,200
have at hand is also important

895
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,460
okay

896
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,200
so that's the definition of outcome and

897
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,919
distinguishability

898
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,260
um very I think hopefully as promised

899
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,419
very sort of cryptographically inspired

900
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,519
or cryptographic in flavor

901
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,679
um and it I think it has a very nice

902
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,559
it's a very nice nice semantics or a

903
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,779
nice type of guarantee

904
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,580
so the way we really think of it this

905
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,380
p-till that this predictor that we're

906
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,480
being given is really a model for how

907
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,520
the world works it's telling us how

908
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,099
people are going to repay their loans

909
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,260
or alternatively if you're thinking

910
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,460
scientifically you could think of it as

911
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,379
a theory a scientific theory for how the

912
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,659
world operates

913
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,820
and assuming we have a very rich class

914
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,139
of distinguishers outcoming

915
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,879
distinguishability guarantees that

916
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,619
predict that the behavior is that the

917
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,899
theory predicts

918
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,060
okay so the way people will the way the

919
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,859
theory predicts that people will repay

920
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,119
their loans

921
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,119
and the actual behaviors observed in the

922
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,040
real world are completely

923
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,820
indistinguishable

924
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,780
no one can tell them no one can tell

925
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,820
them apart and in particular no one can

926
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,619
refute this Theory

927
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,500
there is no way to falsify the theory

928
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,359
right if you want to falsify it and say

929
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,280
no here's you predicted you know your

930
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,560
model P Tilda predicted 0.7 for this

931
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,599
collection of people but actually I'm

932
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,040
saying that they only get a one with

933
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
probability 0.2

934
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,760
well that's a distinguisher so if there

935
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,260
are no distinguishers there's also no

936
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,619
way to falsify the model or refute it

937
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,020
of course that's with this collection of

938
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,700
distinguishers that are doing the

939
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,040
refuting and with this collection of

940
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,420
features or information with this

941
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,640
representation of individuals if we get

942
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,320
a richer representation if we collect

943
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,859
more features more data maybe we can

944
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,420
falsify the prediction the predictor or

945
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,160
the model but one thing that's nice

946
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,540
about our results is that this is

947
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,460
actually if you do this this is a path

948
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,920
towards progress so if you do collect

949
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,099
more information and you're able to

950
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,980
find the distinguisher you can use that

951
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,079
to update the predictor get a new

952
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,540
indistinguishable predictor and this is

953
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,980
a path towards progress in the sense

954
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,180
that your predictor is only getting

955
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,339
closer and closer and closer to the true

956
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,220
probabilities P star

957
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,579
so once we think about prediction as a

958
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,560
goal of once we think about yeah the

959
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,820
task of prediction as a goal of

960
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,380
generating sort of an indistinguishable

961
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,200
model of how reality works

962
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,540
it brings up an interesting hierarchy of

963
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,460
definitions or of strengths in terms of

964
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,380
what kind of access does the

965
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,720
distinguisher get to the model to the

966
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,740
predictions

967
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,720
so I focused on what we call sample

968
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,820
access and distinguishability where the

969
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,440
distinguisher gets

970
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,180
the probability predicted for a

971
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,980
particular instance and an outcome that

972
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,780
is drawn either according to the

973
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,720
prediction or according to reality but

974
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,579
you could give less access for example

975
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:27,720
don't give the prediction the

976
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,280
predictions only the outcomes and you

977
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,660
could give more so you could give the

978
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,880
distinguisher Black Box access to the

979
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,859
predictor you could give it code access

980
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,660
to the actual code

981
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,400
of the predictor

982
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,380
and this makes a difference of course

983
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,760
the more access you give to the

984
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,260
distinguisher the more powerful the

985
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,720
distinguisher gets the harder it gets to

986
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,880
create an indistinguishable predictor

987
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,800
and the stronger the guarantee

988
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,579
um you could also talk about giving the

989
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,920
distinguisher more samples

990
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,119
you don't want to talk about hybrid

991
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,380
arguments

992
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,200
okay so I don't want to tell you too

993
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,760
much about

994
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,460
um algorithms I won't tell you too much

995
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,960
about algorithms I just want to tell you

996
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,760
that this is a really strong definition

997
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,619
and you might worry that it's too strong

998
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,300
but actually we show that it can be

999
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,380
achieved

1000
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,880
and we show this through a connection to

1001
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,520
a notion of multi-calibration oh I

1002
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,839
didn't say so this work on outcome

1003
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,460
indistinguishability is joint work with

1004
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,720
dwark Kim reingold and Yona

1005
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,540
and we show an algorithm for getting

1006
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,980
outcome indistinguishable predictions

1007
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,020
this goes through reduction to

1008
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,180
multi-calibration which is a from a work

1009
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,160
with uh Herbert Johnson Kim and

1010
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,540
rheingold

1011
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,220
doesn't really matter how the algorithm

1012
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,780
Works what I want to tell you is that

1013
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,520
for any class of distinguishers that you

1014
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,040
give me there is a procedure that can

1015
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,579
learn an indistinguishable predictor

1016
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,920
using a logarithmic number of samples so

1017
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,599
logarithmic in the size of the class

1018
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,880
that you're specifying so if for example

1019
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,680
you want to be indistinguishable to all

1020
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,640
circuits of size n to the four

1021
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,099
um you can you can do that using a

1022
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,660
polynomial number of samples yeah

1023
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,160
they're an exponential number of such

1024
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,079
circuits and you can learn an

1025
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,880
indistinguishable predictor using only a

1026
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,520
polynomial number of examples whereby

1027
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,560
examples I mean samples drawn from the

1028
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,359
distribution where you only get to see

1029
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,700
outcomes you never get to see p star you

1030
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,560
only see outcomes did the person repay

1031
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,440
the loan or not and you can come up with

1032
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,220
an indistinguishable predictor P tilde

1033
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,900
um this is an information theoretic

1034
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,460
result there are serious computational

1035
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,160
issues so the algorithm if you ran it

1036
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,839
naively would require exponential

1037
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,578
running time The Learning algorithm

1038
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,079
and this is for similar reasons to the

1039
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,220
fact that many machine learning

1040
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,380
algorithms if you look at the the

1041
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,579
running time that you need from any

1042
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,020
machine learning tests it should be

1043
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,359
exponential in reality we can do

1044
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,920
agnostic learning or machine learning

1045
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,540
works better in practice and in fact

1046
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,339
these algorithms have been implemented

1047
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,920
and they run pretty efficiently for many

1048
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,260
interesting tasks

1049
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,060
now

1050
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,800
I think there are two sides to the coin

1051
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,920
you know is it good news that we can get

1052
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
indistinguishable predictors on the one

1053
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,440
hand it's great right if we're doing

1054
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,880
machine learning we can add predictions

1055
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,859
that no one can falsify hopefully

1056
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,300
there's you know these predictions are

1057
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,760
not doing anything that doesn't make

1058
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,339
sense right we're indistinguishable from

1059
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:20,099
reality so there are no there's no way

1060
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,900
to find that the predictor is doing

1061
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,540
something really silly

1062
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,820
on the other hand there's no guarantee

1063
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,079
that these predictions are actually

1064
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,540
close to the true P Star right it could

1065
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,280
be that we're predicting 0.5 for

1066
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,680
everyone P star is zero for half the

1067
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,780
people and one for half the people so

1068
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,820
our predictor is very far from reality

1069
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,800
but it's still indistinguishable

1070
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,119
so I haven't solved and you know I can't

1071
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,260
solve the question of uh you know

1072
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,280
ensuring that the predict the

1073
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,560
predictions are close to P star if

1074
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,700
that's what you mean by meaningful

1075
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,980
nonetheless I think that this notion of

1076
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,440
indistinguishability is good news and

1077
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,000
the guarantee we're getting is quite

1078
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,040
meaningful

1079
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,980
okay I told you that there were stronger

1080
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,900
levels of indistinguishability in

1081
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,800
particularly you could give the

1082
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,420
distinguisher Oracle access to the

1083
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,859
predictor so it doesn't only see the

1084
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,780
prediction for the particular X

1085
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,180
that it's that we have at hand but it

1086
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,160
can ask about other related individuals

1087
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,740
and see what the predictor does

1088
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,260
we can still get

1089
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,060
um outcoming distinguishability even

1090
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,740
when the distinguishers have Oracle

1091
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,540
access or code access to the predictor

1092
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,599
things get a little more hairy the

1093
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,940
sample complexity becomes exponential in

1094
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,220
the error that you want to achieve in

1095
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,020
the indistinguishability error that you

1096
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,220
want to achieve

1097
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,740
and this is inherent so we also have

1098
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,200
matching lower bounds so

1099
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,180
it really is harder to get

1100
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,280
indistinguishable predictors if you

1101
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,320
allow the auditor or the distinguisher

1102
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,720
to have Oracle access or code access to

1103
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,760
the predictor and we view this as an

1104
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,859
argument for actually if we're using for

1105
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,619
example algorithmic predictions in the

1106
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:01,020
um criminal justice system okay to

1107
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,359
decide on bail conditions

1108
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,460
we really should be giving the Auditors

1109
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,680
Oracle access

1110
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,119
to the algorithm making the

1111
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,980
recommendations about bail or even we

1112
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,480
should be giving them the Code so they

1113
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,640
can audit it

1114
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,320
and such Auditors really are more

1115
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,060
powerful at least from a theoretical

1116
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,099
perspective

1117
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,740
okay so that's all I wanted to say today

1118
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,300
about indistinguishability of

1119
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,820
predictions and now I want to move

1120
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,280
things back to fairness and explain how

1121
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,020
this is related to fairness and in fact

1122
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,760
show that once we have indistinguishable

1123
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,300
predictions we can get really strong

1124
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,040
Notions of fairness for the predictions

1125
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,640
that we're making

1126
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,880
so just before we start defining

1127
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,859
fairness what do people usually do when

1128
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,720
we talk about a predictor and we want to

1129
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,940
ensure the predictor is fair

1130
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,240
or is not being discriminatory the in

1131
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,480
practice the overwhelmingly most common

1132
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,240
approach is we Define a protected set

1133
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,099
that we're interested in say a racial

1134
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:05,700
minority maybe a few protected sets

1135
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,280
and we try to ensure some sort of equal

1136
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,859
behavior of the predictor on the general

1137
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,320
population and on the protected set okay

1138
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,780
so to avoid a situation where for

1139
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,900
example our facial recognition software

1140
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,880
works really well on white people but

1141
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,579
works poorly on darker skinned people

1142
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,950
it's a famous example

1143
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,320
[Music]

1144
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,520
um

1145
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,079
of a behavior that's been demonstrated

1146
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,820
time and again and something that people

1147
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,500
are concerned about so that's known as

1148
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,940
group fairness we're just thinking about

1149
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,220
two groups or a small number of groups

1150
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,859
in Aggregate and we want to equalize the

1151
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,780
behavior of the predictor across the two

1152
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,520
groups

1153
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
and when we say equalize the behavior

1154
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,240
there are various interpretations of

1155
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,520
what that means to force the predictor

1156
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,320
to behave similarly

1157
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,780
so one notion which sometimes is

1158
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,400
appropriate and sometimes is not is to

1159
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,500
try to guarantee statistical parity okay

1160
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,960
so say the average predictions or the

1161
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,359
distribution of predictions for the

1162
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,099
general population and for a protected

1163
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,800
group s are similar

1164
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,319
okay now of course it could be that in a

1165
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,819
certain minority the probability of

1166
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,920
repaying alone is higher or lower than

1167
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,420
the general population and then

1168
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,980
statistical parity wouldn't be

1169
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,960
appropriate often this is sort of a

1170
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,040
corrective

1171
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,900
it does it you know doesn't necessarily

1172
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,460
go in line with the data and we apply it

1173
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,540
as some sort of a corrective

1174
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,579
transformation on the predictions but

1175
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:24,900
there are also many things that we try

1176
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,160
to do

1177
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,900
um that are in line with the data and

1178
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,300
especially trying to ensure similar

1179
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,359
accuracy or similar types of errors on

1180
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,099
the general population and on the

1181
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,140
protected group that we have in mind

1182
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,119
and these are in line with the data so

1183
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,680
maybe we try to equalize the false

1184
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,020
positive and false negative rates or we

1185
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,880
try to ensure calibration so that the

1186
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,260
predictor is not just globally

1187
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,060
calibrated but in fact it's also giving

1188
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,579
calibrated predictions on the minority

1189
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,020
group

1190
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,119
or even loss minimization so make sure

1191
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,220
that the predictions once we restrict to

1192
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,780
the minority group

1193
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,700
the predictions that we're getting are

1194
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,520
still you know have small loss small

1195
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,400
error and are competitive with the best

1196
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,500
say decision tree or the best neural net

1197
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,480
of a certain size

1198
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,300
so there are various interpretations all

1199
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,700
of these I think are quite weak and I'll

1200
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,079
give an example on the next slide

1201
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,960
they're also at odds with each other so

1202
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,359
for example you cannot both have

1203
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,859
calibration

1204
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,800
on S and on T and equalize the false

1205
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,200
positive and false negative rates

1206
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,960
except under you know degenerate cases

1207
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,760
but in all the interesting cases you

1208
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,900
have to choose either you're getting

1209
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,579
calibration or you're equalizing the

1210
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,819
false positive and false negative rates

1211
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,640
and I think so okay that's a serious

1212
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,020
problem

1213
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,579
um but I think a fundamental issue here

1214
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,140
is that what is the group s we're

1215
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,300
talking about If all we're doing and

1216
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,560
this has to do with the weakness of

1217
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,819
these group definitions If all we're

1218
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,700
doing is guaranteeing calibration

1219
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,200
globally over the entire group or

1220
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,579
guaranteeing one of these behaviors

1221
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,800
globally over the entire group we are

1222
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,540
often missing the really interesting

1223
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,520
stuff which is what's happening in

1224
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,680
important subgroups so here's the

1225
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,720
example that I guess I've been waiting

1226
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,220
my whole life to give this example to an

1227
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,960
audience of cryptographers because

1228
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,400
sometimes when you give the example

1229
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,440
people think that it's too malicious or

1230
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,900
too adversarial but this is not for this

1231
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,660
audience so think about trying to

1232
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,240
enforce some sort of Purity so we have a

1233
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,540
steakhouse a racist Steakhouse that is

1234
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,700
running an advertising campaign

1235
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,680
and the steakhouse owner does not want

1236
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,359
any minority people coming to the

1237
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:31,319
steakhouse

1238
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:32,700
nonetheless

1239
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,260
we're living in a fantasy land where

1240
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,119
everything is well regulated and there

1241
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,680
is a regulation saying that you have to

1242
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,599
advertise at equal rates to the general

1243
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,119
population and to the protected minority

1244
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,960
okay so what is an adversarial racist

1245
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,880
Steakhouse owner to do

1246
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,000
you advertise to meat eaters in the

1247
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,859
general population say five percent of

1248
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,839
them that's your budgeting ad and you

1249
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,540
advertise to the vegetarians in s

1250
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,819
so globally you're advertising to five

1251
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,740
percent of the general population and

1252
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,599
five percent of the protected group but

1253
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,220
of course you're advertising the to the

1254
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,359
wrong people in the protected group

1255
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:07,980
they're not the vegetarians are not

1256
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,200
going to show up at the steakhouse

1257
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,780
so we satisfied a very strong

1258
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,700
parity constraint

1259
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,020
but it's totally meaningless

1260
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,700
right and I think this is the kind of

1261
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,960
example that tells you as a

1262
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,880
cryptographer hopefully that this is a

1263
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,160
field that's worth looking into in terms

1264
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,420
of what are the actual you know how

1265
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,220
would you define what fairness means or

1266
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,780
how would you circumvent this kind of

1267
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,540
adversarial Stakehouse Behavior

1268
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,060
okay so my point is fairness relies

1269
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,980
really on identifying what the relevant

1270
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,599
subgroup is

1271
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,359
the carnivores in s and you know this

1272
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:43,980
might be a silly example but there's

1273
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,220
actually a very entrenched practice

1274
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,560
um in the hiring world of interviewing

1275
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,540
minority candidates but interviewing the

1276
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,980
wrong ones the ones that are not you

1277
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,359
know you say Okay interviewed minority

1278
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,339
candidates but they weren't good enough

1279
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,839
but there's some sort of a selection

1280
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,819
bias going on whether maliciously or

1281
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:01,020
non-maliciously where you're not

1282
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,460
interviewing the right people from the

1283
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,119
protected group

1284
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,619
um

1285
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,380
okay so the perspective we're taking

1286
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,300
which as we'll see in a minute is very

1287
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,680
much in line with what I told you about

1288
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,040
outcome and distinguishability before

1289
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,720
um is to talk about multi-group fairness

1290
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,000
we are not going to specify just one

1291
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,920
protected group and try to equalize

1292
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,720
things in aggregate for that group but

1293
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,980
rather we're going to try to give

1294
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,140
protections to a huge maybe an

1295
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,540
exponential collection of intersecting

1296
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,940
groups maybe every group that can be

1297
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,160
identified efficiently from the data is

1298
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,579
going to have some level of protection

1299
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,260
yeah this brings us to the notion of

1300
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,460
multi-calibration which is actually

1301
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,720
where my work

1302
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,940
on prediction

1303
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,079
um fairness and predictions and

1304
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,339
meaningfulness and prediction started

1305
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,500
this is a precursor to outcome

1306
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,060
indistinguishability

1307
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,280
where the requirement was we want to

1308
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,380
have calibration not just for the

1309
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,780
general population and not just for the

1310
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,660
protected group S as a whole right maybe

1311
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,940
it's a group of loan applicants and

1312
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,200
we're just going to stick them all with

1313
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,300
a probability of 0.7 and repaying the

1314
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,500
loan and then we're not really

1315
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,480
identifying who the qualified loan

1316
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,740
applicants are

1317
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,540
but rather we're going to try to ensure

1318
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,920
calibration

1319
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,260
for every subset that can be identified

1320
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,520
efficiently

1321
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,859
within some computational bounds Say by

1322
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,420
circuits of a certain size by

1323
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,280
conjunctions by decision Tree by

1324
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,180
decision list Etc okay so now I have an

1325
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,220
potentially exponential collection of

1326
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,099
intersecting groups and for every single

1327
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,079
group in that collection

1328
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,819
that's large enough if the group just

1329
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,740
has one person or has tiny Mass we're

1330
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,640
not going to be able to do anything

1331
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,500
because we don't see enough people so we

1332
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,300
need the group to be large enough under

1333
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,640
the distribution and then for any such

1334
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,160
group The guarantee is that restricting

1335
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,260
our attention to that group looking at

1336
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,700
the people within the group for whom we

1337
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,060
predicted say 0.7 70 of them should have

1338
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,200
an outcome of one

1339
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,839
okay so that's a strong guarantee and in

1340
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,819
fact it is

1341
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,099
um equivalent I'll talk about that later

1342
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,500
it is not too much later but a little

1343
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,660
bit later it is equivalent to outcoming

1344
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,599
distinguishability if you set things up

1345
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,440
um right

1346
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,760
I want to tell you about an even

1347
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,700
stronger type of guarantee that we can

1348
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,980
give and demonstrate how we achieve it

1349
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,020
through Alchemy distinguishability

1350
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,760
so this is known as multi-group loss

1351
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,099
minimization initially proposed in a

1352
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,560
work by Blum and likunis

1353
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,240
and I'll tell you about results from a

1354
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,540
work of mine with um with galiona

1355
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,760
so now we're going to guarantee that for

1356
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,619
every group in our exponential

1357
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:38,880
collection

1358
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,260
see

1359
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,900
the loss that they experience so the

1360
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,700
loss experienced by members of that

1361
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,079
group

1362
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,220
it's important that I'm taking the

1363
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,839
expectation only over members of the

1364
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:50,160
group

1365
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,140
the laws that they experience is

1366
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,260
competitive with the best hypothesis for

1367
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,260
that group in a class so the predictions

1368
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,260
being supplied for that group are you

1369
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,440
know as good as the best decision tree

1370
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,940
would be the best decision tree for that

1371
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,099
group would be or the best neural net of

1372
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,020
a certain size for that group would be

1373
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,020
so a very strong guarantee

1374
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,520
okay we're really we're being complete

1375
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,319
we're getting competitive loss for all

1376
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,380
of the groups simultaneously

1377
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,900
and you might wonder whether this is

1378
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,180
um okay and a lot good loss to think of

1379
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,680
is the squared loss which I talked about

1380
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,839
earlier

1381
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,540
um so it might look too strong right

1382
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,520
there are these different groups and you

1383
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,500
know maybe one you know one I don't know

1384
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,020
can you really be

1385
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,180
competitive you know maybe group one has

1386
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,859
one hypothesis that they like and group

1387
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:42,599
two has another hypothesis that's good

1388
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,760
for them and how can you be competitive

1389
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,819
with both of these at the same time

1390
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,440
um and for which loss functions is it

1391
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,359
possible I mean is it possible for the

1392
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,559
squared loss that I showed you what

1393
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,619
about more complicated loss functions

1394
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,180
and what I want to tell you is that it's

1395
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,800
in fact possible to achieve this it's

1396
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,380
impossible for a really rich and

1397
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,960
interesting class of loss functions so

1398
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,960
in particular loss functions that are in

1399
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,900
line with what's being shown by the data

1400
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,780
so a loss is called the proper loss this

1401
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,760
is terminology from machine learning

1402
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,240
literature

1403
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,800
um if the thing that minimizes the loss

1404
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,359
if the Cur if giving the correct

1405
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,640
probability is always minimizes the loss

1406
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,260
that's a proper loss

1407
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,579
okay so there are losses that are not

1408
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,619
proper where you where you don't want to

1409
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,119
be predicting the correct probabilities

1410
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,880
but this is a very natural class of loss

1411
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,619
functions in particular losses that are

1412
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:37,319
in line with the with predictions you

1413
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:39,180
know the predictions that will minimize

1414
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,740
the loss are in line with the true

1415
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,920
probabilities okay so the loss of P star

1416
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,359
will be smaller than the loss of any

1417
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,700
other predictor any other hypothesis H

1418
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,740
okay and you can extend this you can

1419
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,020
talk about

1420
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,660
let's think about proper losses for now

1421
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,640
so the theorem that we show is that you

1422
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,960
can get

1423
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,180
a predictor that minimizes the loss for

1424
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,980
all of the groups simultaneously and you

1425
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,300
get it through a reduction to outcome

1426
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,200
indistinguishability

1427
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,579
the result as follows from this theorem

1428
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:10,500
it says that for any loss proper loss

1429
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,119
function that you want for any

1430
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,880
collection of groups exponential

1431
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,260
overlapping groups for and for any

1432
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,640
Benchmark class that you care about

1433
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,559
there exists a collection of

1434
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,420
distinguishers so that's the reduction

1435
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,880
so that if a predictor is outcoming

1436
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,339
indistinguishable for this collection

1437
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:28,380
then it is also competitive with age for

1438
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,240
all of the groups simultaneously I'm

1439
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,520
lying a little bit you need to do some

1440
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,960
tweaking to the predictor to make it

1441
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,800
competitive but

1442
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,420
um as far as we're concerned this is a

1443
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,280
result and in the five minutes

1444
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,059
less than five minutes I want to tell

1445
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:46,859
you something about this connection

1446
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:48,300
because I think it's a really nice

1447
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,460
demonstration of why thinking about

1448
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,140
indistinguishable predictions gives you

1449
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,420
a lot of power to get other guarantees

1450
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,319
okay so I just want to do a warm-up

1451
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,520
where we're thinking about a single

1452
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,559
Benchmark hypothesis okay so we want to

1453
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,079
have less loss than this fixed

1454
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,540
hypothesis H for the general population

1455
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,720
not for groups so

1456
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,000
I just want to show that if you want to

1457
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,040
compete to have competitive loss with a

1458
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,960
fixed hypothesis there is a

1459
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,160
distinguisher we can build a

1460
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,420
distinguisher such that if you're

1461
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,339
indistinguishable for this single

1462
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,260
distinguisher then you will also have

1463
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,300
better loss or no worse loss than this

1464
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,760
hypothesis h

1465
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,420
and the theorem follows by just having a

1466
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,400
distinguisher for each of the hypotheses

1467
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,559
in The Benchmark class and for each

1468
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,119
group

1469
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,559
um and we don't need to get into it in

1470
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:38,640
the talk today

1471
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,500
so how does this distinguisher work it's

1472
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,660
a distinguisher so it gets an x a

1473
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,640
predicted probability for x and an

1474
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,200
outcome maybe the outcome is drawn

1475
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,760
according to P tilde maybe it's drawn

1476
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,460
according to P star we don't know yet

1477
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,200
and the way this distinguisher works is

1478
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,460
it's going to Output one with

1479
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,140
probability that's proportional to the

1480
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,420
difference between the loss that we

1481
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,520
would get for the outcome y according to

1482
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,520
the prediction P tilde and the loss we

1483
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,020
would get if we used H right this

1484
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,960
distinguisher has H in its belly we want

1485
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,880
to say that if you are indistinguishable

1486
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,980
to this distinguisher which depends on H

1487
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,740
it has H in its belly then you also have

1488
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,180
competitive loss PTL doesn't

1489
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,619
distinguishable in ptil that has

1490
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,059
competitive loss

1491
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,920
okay so the important thing is this

1492
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,200
predict this distinguisher outputs one

1493
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,500
with high probability if H is better

1494
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,480
than P tilde for this particular

1495
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,400
distribution of y's

1496
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,500
and an output 0 with higher probability

1497
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,839
if P tilde is better than H for this

1498
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,220
particular

1499
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,020
um distribution of y's

1500
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,240
and we build it in such a way so that

1501
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,300
the the if it you know it outputs one

1502
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,280
with probability less than a half the

1503
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,420
probability is taken over the

1504
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,640
distribution over X and P told of X and

1505
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,960
Y if and only if the loss of P tilde

1506
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,540
when the outcomes are drawn by y over

1507
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,880
the there's an expectation here over the

1508
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,319
distribution but trying to make the

1509
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,720
notation simple so the loss of P tilde

1510
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,160
when the outcomes are drawn according to

1511
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,680
Y is less than the loss of H according

1512
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,099
to Y so if P tilde is better than h

1513
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,680
you'll output 0 most of the time if P

1514
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,599
tilde is worse than H you'll output one

1515
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:15,119
most of the time okay

1516
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,920
so let's look at what this distinguisher

1517
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,599
does when we give it outcome sampled

1518
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,700
according to P tilde so we give it y

1519
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,920
tilde outcomes

1520
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,260
well now we know it's a proper loss so P

1521
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,119
tilde is actually giving us perfect

1522
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,280
predictions for the outcomes that we're

1523
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,380
seeing and the loss is a proper loss so

1524
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,700
by definition

1525
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,740
we're always going to get less loss

1526
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,079
people that is having is has less loss

1527
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:38,280
than h

1528
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,140
and this distinguisher outputs one with

1529
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,180
probability less than a half

1530
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,880
okay well what happens when we feed in

1531
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,980
true y Stars drawn from the true

1532
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,260
distribution if P tilde is

1533
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,760
indistinguishable then the probability

1534
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,319
of the distinguisher outputting one is

1535
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,380
about the same approximately the same

1536
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,900
so roughly it will still output 1 with

1537
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,760
probability less than a half but what

1538
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,900
does that mean we said that this

1539
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,220
distinguisher outputs one with

1540
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,500
probability less than a half if and only

1541
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,980
if P tilde has less loss than h on this

1542
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,200
distribution

1543
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,359
so now we know that P tilde has less

1544
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,880
loss on the true distribution than this

1545
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,460
H and we're done

1546
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,220
it was too fast to follow there's a

1547
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,960
painfully detailed write-up in the

1548
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,880
proceedings

1549
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,760
um okay so that was our warm-up and we

1550
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,559
get from that our theorem where we can

1551
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,300
actually minimize loss for all of these

1552
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,520
subgroups simultaneously for a very rich

1553
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,520
collection of loss functions

1554
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,079
okay

1555
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:40,079
good so this work is leading uh to an

1556
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,160
emerging I guess we call it an atlas or

1557
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,920
maybe a fairness zoo of different

1558
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,260
Notions different guarantees for

1559
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,700
predictions we talked a lot about

1560
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,500
outcome in distinguishability where the

1561
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,780
predictor can't be refuted we talked

1562
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,520
less about multi-calibration but I told

1563
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,960
you that these two Notions are actually

1564
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,839
equivalent in a very strong sense

1565
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,660
and we saw now a reduction from loss

1566
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,859
minimization to outcome in

1567
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:06,540
distinguishability right I want lost

1568
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,300
minimization I can define an appropriate

1569
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,160
class of distinguishers such that

1570
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,780
outcome and distinguishability will give

1571
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,880
me multi-group loss minimization so we

1572
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,319
have these nice connections and this

1573
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,599
picture is out of date by now we have a

1574
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,920
couple of more Notions and very

1575
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,559
interesting uh interactions between them

1576
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,619
um in terms of Frontiers for lack of

1577
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,599
time I won't talk about Omni predictors

1578
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,240
but they're great I do want to talk and

1579
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,740
by talking about corrective

1580
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,140
Transformations so everything we saw

1581
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,599
today outcome indistinguishability loss

1582
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,420
minimization calibration everything is

1583
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,640
geared towards accuracy with respect to

1584
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,579
the underlying data distribution

1585
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,980
so these Notions are all as we say

1586
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,599
descriptive they're trying to describe

1587
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,640
the reality they're not trying to

1588
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,740
correct it they're not trying to Aspire

1589
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,839
to some better reality they are just

1590
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,240
trying to reflect the reality in a way

1591
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,240
that is Meaningful that you know is

1592
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,740
considerate of all the different groups

1593
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,480
we might have that is not leaving anyone

1594
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,819
out but we're not trying to fix or

1595
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,920
change anything

1596
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,480
of course it's very natural and it's

1597
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,160
done all the time to try to apply

1598
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,380
corrective Transformations if you have

1599
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,040
some sort of affirmative action policy

1600
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,960
um some corrective discrimination policy

1601
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,660
to get to a better world

1602
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,160
and this raises interesting questions

1603
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,660
once you think about it from the

1604
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,760
perspective that I told you about today

1605
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,099
really if we can agree on how suppose we

1606
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:33,420
can agree on how we would want to

1607
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,700
correct the world okay there's some

1608
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,980
corrective transformation Tau that we

1609
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,900
would like to apply to P star and that

1610
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,119
would fix problems with discrimination

1611
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,819
in the data and you know the historical

1612
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:46,740
historical issues that are present in

1613
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,500
the data um you know that we want to

1614
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,200
remove or improve on

1615
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,599
but we don't know Tower of P Stars so

1616
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,819
you know we don't know P Stars so we

1617
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:59,040
can't get Tau we can't transform P star

1618
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,160
all we can get are these approximations

1619
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,319
and so if we apply this corrective

1620
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,299
transformation to something that is not

1621
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:08,940
really P star what is going to happen

1622
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,319
so it's natural to try to be

1623
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,299
indistinguishable and it isn't always

1624
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,180
possible so try to get to a new

1625
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,980
predictor that is indistinguishable from

1626
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,260
Tau of P star from the way we would want

1627
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,900
to correct the true reality and we have

1628
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,460
this is work

1629
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,799
um with Cynthia dork and Omar reingold

1630
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,000
where we characterize the

1631
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,260
Transformations

1632
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,140
um for which that's possible

1633
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,020
okay so I want to wrap up

1634
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:34,980
um

1635
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,660
I think no one needs to be convinced

1636
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,640
anymore that algorithmic predictions are

1637
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,900
incredibly impactful for individuals

1638
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,119
um but they're just numbers and we need

1639
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,260
to make sure that they are meaningful

1640
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,000
and that they are fair

1641
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,680
so we have these New Perspectives

1642
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,240
outcoming distinguishability and

1643
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,160
multi-group fairness that are very

1644
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,319
computational and cryptographic in

1645
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:58,140
nature and I think are very promising or

1646
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,780
interesting to work on the guarantees

1647
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,839
are in line with accuracy and we have by

1648
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,819
now a rich Theory I didn't tell you

1649
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,920
about implementations and deployment but

1650
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,540
I've been involved in using some of

1651
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,859
these ideas

1652
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:12,480
um in the context of medical risk

1653
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,160
prediction in Israel

1654
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,619
they work well in practice or they seem

1655
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,900
to work well in practice so I think it's

1656
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,400
a very interesting story and very

1657
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,460
promising field to work on but there's a

1658
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,160
lot more to be done and I think the main

1659
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,880
thing is you know really working on

1660
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,099
biased data distribution so what can we

1661
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,319
say you know if the data themselves

1662
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,380
we know the data are not fair right data

1663
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,760
are coming from The Real World where

1664
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,319
there's terrible discrimination going on

1665
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,960
so what can we say about that

1666
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,460
um I think they're also very interesting

1667
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,660
questions that you're welcome to ask me

1668
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,940
about in a minute or during the coffee

1669
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,220
break about fairness in other settings

1670
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,140
you know prediction is not everything in

1671
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,660
algorithms so in complex resource

1672
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,640
allocation problems I'm particularly

1673
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,440
interested in two-sided matching markets

1674
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,900
so you can ask me about that and I think

1675
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,859
I'll end here thank you

1676
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,449
[Music]

1677
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,660
thank you very much thank you very much

1678
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,819
guy uh we have time for questions

1679
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,440
if you have any questions please step up

1680
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,220
to the microphones

1681
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,260
okay so thanks for the inspirational

1682
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,819
talk and obviously you have lots of

1683
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:34,500
questions I try to ask the best of them

1684
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,619
I can't can't

1685
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:40,020
promise so it kind of has two two

1686
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,119
aspects that question so I think you you

1687
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,780
mentioned that um the loss depends on

1688
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,660
kind of the availability of features and

1689
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,220
kind of how much data you have about

1690
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,859
people basically so it depends also on

1691
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:54,420
the privacy invasiveness of the

1692
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,680
operation right so if you're very

1693
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,299
privacy invasive you know everything

1694
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:59,280
about the person probably you can know

1695
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,720
what they're going to do better than

1696
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,400
they know it themselves I mean that's

1697
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,160
kind of it's a thesis that people have

1698
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,740
posted and it might be too the other

1699
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,599
question is do we want that like um so

1700
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,099
how do we want our predictions actually

1701
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:13,440
to be too good so that's one question

1702
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,059
but that's only the passive security

1703
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,940
part of it so the active security part

1704
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,220
is that you can make like the best

1705
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,440
predictions are those that you um cost

1706
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,660
yourself so in a way you can you can get

1707
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,760
a perfect predictor if you kind of do an

1708
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,200
active attack and you make sure that the

1709
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,140
outcome is exactly what you want so kind

1710
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,940
of can this kind of self-fulfilling

1711
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,920
predictions also be kind of modeled in

1712
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,079
the in that model so it's kind of two

1713
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:39,299
two questions wrapped into one but uh

1714
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:42,119
maybe you maybe there's some connections

1715
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:44,220
um so I'm yeah let me take them one by

1716
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,740
one so I think the first question is

1717
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,960
um wonderful motivation for many talks

1718
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,700
that I hope will hear in Euro Crypt

1719
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,799
about

1720
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,839
um you know how to get the best of both

1721
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,700
worlds you know

1722
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,640
do machine learning that does is able to

1723
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,400
act is able to be informed by very

1724
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,380
granular data about individuals while

1725
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,660
still preserving privacy and we know

1726
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,240
that we have you know amazing work and

1727
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,559
techniques on that it doesn't have to be

1728
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,660
an either or choice right you know maybe

1729
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,160
we collect data but everything is

1730
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,440
encrypted and is being run using secure

1731
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,420
multi-party computation and the outcomes

1732
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,119
are all differentially private and

1733
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,000
we get incredible predictors with no

1734
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,440
privacy harms right like I think that's

1735
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,020
the world that we should sort of be

1736
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,540
inspired to move towards

1737
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,940
um for the second part

1738
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,619
um it's interesting I usually I'm gonna

1739
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:35,700
take the question in a different

1740
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,079
direction and I think you asked because

1741
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,040
I don't

1742
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,020
think necessarily

1743
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,350
you know of the predictor as

1744
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:42,839
[Music]

1745
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,839
um

1746
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,040
you're thinking about a game where the

1747
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,359
predictor is being rewarded if the

1748
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:49,440
predictions are perfect and the

1749
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,940
predictor is trying to cheat

1750
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,440
it's interesting I haven't thought about

1751
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,640
it but I'm going to take it in a

1752
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,319
different direction which is you know

1753
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:57,119
the individuals are trying to win right

1754
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,960
so it's kind of um gosh I forget now but

1755
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,700
there's this sort of a rule or whatever

1756
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,660
that as soon as you publish your um

1757
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,400
you know your decision-making Rule

1758
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,140
people are going to start gaming it you

1759
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,579
know if someone remembers this is a

1760
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,740
principle but I forget the name of it so

1761
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,480
for example you know like if your

1762
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,520
predictor says that people who you know

1763
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,260
maybe you find some causal relationship

1764
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,599
some uh correlation in the data showing

1765
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,099
that people who have many books in their

1766
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:25,260
home do well in college okay so you use

1767
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,700
that for your College admission I mean

1768
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,720
the next thing that's going to happen is

1769
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,799
that next year people are going to start

1770
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,240
buying books and having having them in

1771
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,140
their house

1772
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,760
so this is known as setting a

1773
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,020
performative prediction and there's a

1774
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,099
lot of beautiful works on it

1775
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,960
particularly some work by Moritz heart

1776
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,640
and his group that I recommend looking

1777
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,319
at um that I think is interesting and

1778
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,760
it's the kind of thing

1779
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,200
yeah I like that you brought it up

1780
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,420
because again it's a kind of uh there is

1781
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,520
a type of adversarial thinking involved

1782
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,079
that I think is very relevant for this

1783
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:53,299
audience so something else to look at

1784
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,540
questions

1785
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,900
yes uh ask a question then um so for the

1786
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,319
uh uh the oi uh condition it seems to me

1787
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,359
again um like it's sort of a sanity

1788
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:14,280
check if that's fair to say for a

1789
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,900
predictor we would like it to satisfy

1790
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,119
this notion of OI and ideally the

1791
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:20,400
strongest notion of code-based OI so do

1792
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,720
you think there are sort of

1793
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,880
uh techniques or cryptographic

1794
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,319
techniques to say distinguish between

1795
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,380
say two two uh predictors that satisfy

1796
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,660
this code based oi uh condition how

1797
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,980
could I should decide how should I

1798
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,140
decide which one to use

1799
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,819
It's a Wonderful question it's a

1800
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:37,859
question that's been there's old work on

1801
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,839
it and there's new work on it and

1802
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,760
there's good news so if you give me two

1803
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,280
different predictors that are so okay so

1804
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,559
there can be the motivation behind the

1805
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,640
question is that there can be many

1806
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,859
different predictors that satisfy that

1807
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:50,819
are all in this that are

1808
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,619
indistinguishable and suppose we are

1809
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,420
presented with two of them

1810
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,579
they're represented with two predictors

1811
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,339
and they're both indistinguishable to

1812
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:00,960
our set of distinguishers that we have

1813
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,299
determined so which one should we use so

1814
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,260
you don't have to choose there's

1815
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,359
actually a simple procedure for refining

1816
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:08,520
them that will only they will get you

1817
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,559
something that is better than if they're

1818
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,720
different in both oi it will get you

1819
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,880
something that is at least as good as

1820
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,260
the best of them and hopefully better

1821
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,540
than both of them and it's an efficient

1822
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,160
refining procedure it will still be

1823
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,960
indistinguishable

1824
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,400
um and kind of the issue is the minute

1825
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,839
these two predictors are both

1826
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:26,520
indistinguishable but different from

1827
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,980
each other the predictors themselves if

1828
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,240
you look inside them they're telling you

1829
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,740
how to distinguish between them because

1830
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,440
you can look you know let's look at the

1831
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,480
people from predictor once said 0.3 and

1832
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,240
predictor two said 0.7

1833
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,119
you know let's draw some sample examples

1834
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:43,859
and see what the actual outcome is and

1835
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:45,539
now we can refine both predictors very

1836
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:47,960
easily

1837
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,099
so in general

1838
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:51,780
um with outcoming distinguishability

1839
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,579
there's this really nice feature that I

1840
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,440
only talked about briefly or hinted at

1841
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,380
that any refutation anything you find

1842
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,700
that shows you you're doing something

1843
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,559
wrong is a bummer because you know

1844
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,000
someone refuted your predictor but it's

1845
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,700
also a path towards progress

1846
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,319
you can refine your predictor and do

1847
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:09,500
better

1848
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,160
so thank you very much we will take a

1849
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,619
break now let's think right there thank

1850
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,799
you

1851
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,629
