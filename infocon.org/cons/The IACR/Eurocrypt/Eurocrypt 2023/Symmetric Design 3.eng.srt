1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
welcome to the last session of the day

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,259
which I believe is called the hypnosis

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,779
tree or something of that sort symmetric

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,580
Crypt analysis

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,080
three

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,599
we have three very interesting talks

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,580
today and if it would be good if we have

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,699
the yes excellent thank you

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,840
um first one is proof of mirror theory

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,080
for a wide range of zMAX and it will be

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,220
given by abhishanka Saha joint work with

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,980
benowa kogliani avijit

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,140
due to

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
um

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,880
and that talk will be given by

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,920
abhishanka

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,800
hi everybody I'm going to present proof

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,300
of meter 3 for a wide range of zymax

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,559
with a joint work with

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,579
so

21
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,680
military is born out of each coefficient

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
technique which I will briefly introduce

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,059
first and then go into mirror Theory

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,640
so in the indistinguishability setup the

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,260
adversary interacts with the con with

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,880
the construction in the real world and

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,740
with its idealized counterpart in the

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,260
ideal world

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,939
and the advantage of the adversary is

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,380
bounded by the statistical distance

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,080
between these two random variables which

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,119
is basically representing the

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,580
transcripts generated in the respective

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,479
worlds

35
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,360
so

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,420
for a subset of good transcripts which

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,920
we Define H coefficient technique

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,180
basically bounds the statistical

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,540
Distance by this value

40
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,759
where the ideal World probabilities this

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,799
one and this one are easy to calculate

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,200
because it just involves a random Oracle

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,439
however this real world probability is

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,400
uh

45
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,700
to calculate it it is much more involved

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,159
so we need a lower bound on the number

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,020
of transcripts that are both real world

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
realizable and also good to get a get

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,579
this upper bound on the statistical

50
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,979
distance now this real world relativity

51
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,220
restrictions and goodness restrictions

52
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,920
they are manifested in terms of system

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,340
of equations ah

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,080
and we need to lower bound the number of

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,400
solutions to the system of equations

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,440
where minute Theory comes in

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
so take for example

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,319
the zort construction so it has as input

59
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,760
x i and as output this enter y Vector y

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,459
i vector and the underlying primitive is

61
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,760
a random permutation pi so

62
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,140
as one can see if this is the transcript

63
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,180
Tau

64
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,599
so if for any y i one component of y i y

65
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,900
i j is equals to 0 or if two components

66
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,000
of Y I uh are equal

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,700
then the adversity obviously understands

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,220
that it is uh interacting with the ideal

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,019
world because in real world it will

70
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,319
never happen so we Define our good

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,540
transcripts to be those transcripts for

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,760
which Such trivial attacks doesn't work

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,780
and now if we

74
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,660
represent the outputs of the random

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,480
permutation by capital x i JS then we

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,620
get this real world realizability

77
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,420
restrictions which you can see is a

78
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
system of bivarity equations and non

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,860
equations where the non equations just

80
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,900
mean that the variables are pairwise

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,879
distinct

82
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,580
okay so now we go into mirror Theory so

83
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,800
given a system of binary defined

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,140
equations we can always

85
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,120
equivalent to represent it with a

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,519
labeled undetected graph where there is

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,379
an edge between two variables so the

88
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,239
variable the vertices are the variables

89
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,519
and in an age between two variables if

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,140
there is an equation between those two

91
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,300
variables the label of that age being

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,060
equal to the coefficient of the equation

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,319
okay

94
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,900
so now you can see that to for this

95
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,000
system of solution equations to have any

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
solution

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,500
ah any cycle in this graph

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,140
must have label sum equals to zero also

99
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,640
if the solution needs to be pairwise

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,620
distinct

101
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,000
any path should have level some not

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,620
equals to zero

103
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,700
okay and if you so if you assign value

104
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,299
to any variable any vertex all the other

105
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,220
vertices in its component gets

106
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,500
determined so that is how components

107
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
become a significant factor in our

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,760
analysis and in fact dry Max in our

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,738
title of in the title of our paper is

110
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,620
the size of the largest component

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,020
also we can transform any system of

112
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,000
equations into into an equivalent system

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,180
of equations ah where which has this

114
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,220
exact same set of solutions however

115
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,780
which has as components ah Stars

116
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,720
ok so how do you do that as we choose

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,419
the center of the star say x one and

118
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,880
then

119
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,500
just for any other vertex in its

120
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,440
component we introduce an age between X1

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,199
and that vertex and as label of that age

122
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,180
we give the label sum of the path

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,880
between X1 to X that vertex in the

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,639
original graph so and all other edges

125
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,900
become redundant all other equations

126
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,180
become redundant so we get a star

127
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,220
component like this

128
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,780
okay

129
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,400
and this is called a standard form of

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,580
the system now in the labels of the

131
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,699
edges of the star cannot be equal

132
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,060
because of course then so suppose if

133
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,979
these two values are equal then these

134
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,180
two vertices will get the same value

135
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,740
that is not permissible pair with

136
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,979
distinctness again uh this value cannot

137
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,900
be 0 because then this value and this

138
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,380
value will be equal so

139
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,180
so these things defined here Gamma 1 to

140
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,400
gamma Q must be sets and now we have

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,020
shown that how a system of ah

142
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,120
consistent system of equations can be

143
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,400
represented by a set system containing

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,020
as many sets as their components with

145
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,020
each set having size same as the size of

146
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,639
the corresponding component we

147
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,820
conceively call it a galaxy of stars

148
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,560
so how to generate a solution to the

149
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,060
system so we first can uniformly and

150
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,020
independently generate Q in bit values

151
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,340
assign them to the centers of the stars

152
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,620
and automatically the other vertices get

153
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,880
determined

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
so so this is our generated solution and

155
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,320
if we take any particular pairwage

156
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,400
listing solution to the system of

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,620
equations then our generated solution

158
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,419
will be same as that particular solution

159
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,060
with this probability because just the

160
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,039
centers have to match so this is two

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,120
zero minus n q

162
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,000
now we Define a disjointness event where

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,620
the

164
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,039
translates of the states gamma I by RI

165
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,660
has to be disjoint which is same as

166
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,259
saying that these R Tuple gives the

167
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,660
pairwise distinct solution ah for the

168
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,600
system and P gamma the probability of

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
this digital this dynous event by your

170
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,660
previous argument is just the number of

171
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,639
PD solutions to the system by 2 to the

172
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,500
power of n q

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,419
now you're ready to set our main result

174
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,500
so

175
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,259
if the size of the largest component is

176
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,580
of the order of two to the power of n by

177
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,340
4 and if the number of variables is uh

178
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,680
has this order of two to the power of

179
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,660
inbound

180
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,400
then

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,060
P gamma is lower bounded by this value

182
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,280
so 2 to the power of infinity by two of

183
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,199
n v which by your previous argument

184
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,120
implies that the number of PD solutions

185
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,440
to a system of equations having e

186
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,080
equations in variables has this lower

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
bound to determine the following

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,139
factorial V where to begin n to the E

189
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,599
because e is V minus Q because e is the

190
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,460
number of edges of a forest of V

191
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,599
vertices and Q components ah so and this

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,639
bound actually has this intuition that

193
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,800
if we have picked all the variables

194
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,759
randomly then each equation would hold

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
with probability one by two to the power

196
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
of n and the number of pair with

197
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,880
distinct vectors of size V is actually V

198
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,280
okay

199
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,800
so we go into the proof strategy so if

200
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,380
there is there was just one star and for

201
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,720
any value assigned to the center since

202
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,479
Gamma 1 is a set all the solution that

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,060
is generated by this R1 will be pairwage

204
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,400
distinct has to be so P gamma is equals

205
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,699
to 1 here so for smaller galaxies

206
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,500
calculation of P gamma is very easy so

207
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,479
what we want to do is we take a big

208
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,300
Galaxy and we try to remove the stars

209
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,680
from the Galaxy

210
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
so say Gamma 1 is s the star we're gonna

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,479
remove

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,879
then this smaller Galaxy

213
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,300
this smaller Galaxy

214
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,699
so the number of the the r tuples that

215
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,960
will generate PD solutions for this

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
smaller Galaxy will not generate PT

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,320
Solutions for the larger Galaxy if

218
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,919
some of these s elements coincide with

219
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,620
some of this gamma minus s elements and

220
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,260
the probability of such coincidence is

221
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,820
just one by two to the power of n that

222
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,920
is how we get our crude bound however

223
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,740
this is far from being done because when

224
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,180
we iterate this crude bound which means

225
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,100
that we remove starts one by one from

226
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,560
the Galaxy we get about the bound on Q

227
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,320
which is not desired at all however if

228
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
the total number of variables was

229
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
actually under but the bound then this

230
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,459
could bound can be manipulated to get

231
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,279
this bound on P gamma which is mentioned

232
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,839
in our main result

233
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,120
okay so we look further instead of

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,040
removing a star we just remove a link

235
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,019
from a star so

236
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,180
this is our original Galaxy suppose we

237
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,100
remove this star and get this reduced

238
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,140
this link and get this reduced Galaxy

239
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,540
and again by the same same kind of

240
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,660
arguments so an art Tuple solving this

241
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,640
reduced Galaxy will not give a PD

242
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,740
solution for the original Galaxy if

243
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,660
something like this happens

244
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,560
right so and this galaxy which also

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
satis and this equality happens with

246
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,519
probability one by two Reserve n and

247
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,279
this galaxy such that this equality

248
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,200
holds is actually this merged Galaxy

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,440
where we have removed this component

250
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,800
entirely and merged it with the reduced

251
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,779
merge the Delta translate of it to the

252
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,700
reduced this

253
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,180
so identity is this just algebra okay

254
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,279
so yeah so and also this Delta Translate

255
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,740
needs to be disjoint from this reduced

256
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,839
star because otherwise the system will

257
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,120
not be not have a pairwage distinct

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,160
solution okay

259
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,360
so what we have we have the link

260
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,339
deletion equation which is very crucial

261
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,399
for our paper so we which basically says

262
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,800
that the art Tuple solving the original

263
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,540
giving a PT solution for the original

264
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,220
Galaxy

265
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,560
are basically the art tuples giving a

266
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,300
pairwise lifting solution for this

267
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,580
reduced Galaxy with this X link removed

268
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,060
minus the r tuples that give a pair

269
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,620
resisting solution for this merged

270
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,580
Galaxy

271
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,240
so we are we have expressed P gamma in

272
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,820
terms of smaller galaxies where here one

273
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,560
link is at least removed and here

274
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,500
although there is a large component

275
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
number of components is one less

276
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,860
and this summation is this index set is

277
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,019
basically all contains all the Delta NS

278
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,000
dashes such that the Delta translates of

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,860
s Dash doesn't coincide with our reduced

280
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,440
or S minus X

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,200
okay so ah

282
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,240
what we want to do is actually we want

283
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,220
to express P gamma in terms of P gamma

284
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,100
minus X so ah we want this enter right

285
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,320
hand side to be in terms of this for

286
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,180
that we need to express the merged

287
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,620
Galaxy probability in terms of the

288
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,200
reduced Galaxy probability and bound I

289
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,740
so we mounted I like this where we have

290
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,959
used two crucial points that the group

291
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,740
we are working on the nvid values with

292
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,140
bitvisor is of x 1 and 2 and the link

293
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,240
that is being removed this x this x has

294
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,920
to be appropriately chosen details in

295
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,700
paper

296
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,620
uh so

297
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,959
now

298
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,779
to express this in terms of this we just

299
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,519
denote them by Tau and Tau Dash write

300
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,740
down the link deletion equations for

301
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,519
this galaxies and subtract them take

302
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,839
modulus take maximum maximum maximum and

303
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,880
we get a recursive inequity in D terms

304
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
where D is the maximum possible distance

305
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,820
between galaxies and galaxies where two

306
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,300
of the components are merged uh okay so

307
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,040
technical things

308
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,959
so we get a nice recursive inequality

309
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,019
for D terms which is nice because ah

310
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,459
this term will finish after L minus 1

311
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,860
iterations this term though being a

312
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,740
under some summation is multiplied by J

313
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,320
Max by 2 to the power of n which will be

314
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,540
geometrically reduced and the last ugly

315
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,459
looking parasite term will not be an

316
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,380
issue after after logarithm or number of

317
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,480
iterations so basically iterate this

318
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,360
recursive inequality J Max Dot N times

319
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,300
and then applying our crude Mound we get

320
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,660
abound on DQ s minus 2 y d q s minus 2

321
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,899
because when we expand it we basically

322
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,320
get a relation between this merge Galaxy

323
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
and the radio Galaxy and putting this uh

324
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
Bound in the original original link

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,579
deletion equation we just get this so

326
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,380
for a privilege of the next

327
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,940
P gamma is this times become gamma minus

328
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,639
X so obviously the next step is we

329
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,639
remove links one by one until we have a

330
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,019
galaxy of the size but the bound

331
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
and that is how

332
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,360
by simple algebra we get our result so

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
this is we have arrived at a result

334
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
and now this is the interesting part how

335
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,200
we apply our result for the security

336
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,720
analysis of many constructions one

337
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
interesting one is six round five still

338
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,820
so um to get the real world

339
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,440
realizability of this transcript Tau

340
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,540
here we have to find the number of six

341
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,440
triples of functions F1 to F6 such that

342
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,220
the Phi still of F1 to F6 of l i r i is

343
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,100
equals to s i t i for all I ah so

344
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,260
exactly collaborates with Tau so we have

345
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,760
to calculate the number of six tuples

346
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,040
how we do it we first generate the

347
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,519
values of F1 r i and F6 t i

348
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,139
uh F6 s i sorry and then

349
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,740
we modify our transcript so now we have

350
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,320
to just calculate the number of four

351
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,380
tuples of functions F22 F5 such that it

352
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,880
exactly collaborates with this modified

353
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
transcript Tau Dash

354
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,660
okay

355
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,880
now we come to the system of equations

356
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,200
so if we can see that x i equals to if x

357
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,420
i equals to x j then f 2 x i equals to f

358
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,560
2 x j and so r i e z or Y I should be

359
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,440
equals to R J's or y j so

360
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,139
we get this kind of equations but this x

361
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,300
i equals to x j and a i equals to x j a

362
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,820
j are determined by the random values we

363
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,880
have determined here so we know the

364
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,940
equality is already however for z and y

365
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,500
we do not know whether they will be

366
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,779
equal or not so we instantaneate what

367
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,240
you call a framework all this is not

368
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
necessary but what we see here whenever

369
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,980
we so a framework is a collection of

370
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,839
equalities on Y and Z variables whenever

371
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,180
we instantiate that framework we

372
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,199
obviously instantiate also

373
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,300
non-equalities among the other y's and Z

374
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,880
variables so this is a system of

375
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,380
equations and non equations

376
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,079
and the number of such four tuples is

377
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,760
basically this

378
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,120
okay so number of y q satisfying c one c

379
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,339
one is this number of Z q satisfying C

380
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,199
two so this is where the mirror three

381
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,779
results come in come in play and when we

382
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,839
put it there and then also it has to be

383
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,040
a good framework what what do you mean

384
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,600
by good framework so good framework is

385
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,860
those Frameworks for which this system

386
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,360
of equations are consistent and has a

387
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,779
pairwage listing solution so there and

388
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,279
yeah so

389
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,740
we do the good frame of thing and we get

390
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,360
such a bound on the number of foot

391
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,620
tuples

392
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,440
and doing each coefficient technique

393
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,199
we basically get this and so we have

394
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,380
that six salaries uh n bit sprp is

395
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,500
secure from our meter three user okay

396
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,420
and now I am going to end with some open

397
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,800
variants of major Theory which are still

398
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,899
to be proven so as you have seen our

399
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,639
system of non equations is basically x i

400
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,920
z or x j is not equals to 0 to the power

401
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440
of n so all the non equations have

402
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
labeled coefficient 0 to the power of n

403
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
so homogeneous system of non equations

404
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
we can extend it to non homogeneous

405
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,019
system of non non equations which

406
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,760
becomes useful when the ins round

407
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,860
function say when the round functions of

408
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,560
the Phi still construction are part

409
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,120
mutations so then you need non

410
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,220
homogeneous system of non equations we

411
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,899
can expand to groups of exponent not

412
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,420
equals to two used in format preserving

413
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,820
encryption so also our GI Max has a

414
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,079
bound of two to the power n by four by

415
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,240
two over n we can expand it to any time

416
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,699
x larger than that and also our

417
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,740
equations are all by radiate so why not

418
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,380
a system of any system of equations

419
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,339
yeah so thank you

420
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,680
foreign

421
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,660
thank you for this interesting

422
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,519
presentation it was clear so I don't

423
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,440
have any questions but perhaps the

424
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,459
audience

425
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,540
I'd like to ask a question

426
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,618
then if not let's turn the speaker again

427
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:15,228
[Applause]

428
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,760
so the next talk is the non-adaptive

429
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,559
universal one-way hash functions from

430
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,600
arbitrary one-way functions

431
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,340
given by Shinu Mao no I'm and it's a

432
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,520
joint work with noamazoo and G Peng Zang

433
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,299
hey thanks for the introduction uh hi

434
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm shimmy Mao from University of

435
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,200
Southern California I'll talk about Nang

436
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,240
adaptive Universal only hash functions

437
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,700
from arbitrary one-way functions this is

438
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,039
don't work with no Amazon and Japan

439
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,860
so let's let me introduce our main

440
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,780
characters first the first one is

441
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,059
one-way function which is well known a

442
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,039
func we say a function f is a one-way

443
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,100
function if it is easy to compute and

444
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,000
hard to invert given a random image

445
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,980
so the existence of one-way function is

446
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,360
universally accepted as a minimal

447
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,000
assumption for cryptography and our

448
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,100
second main character is universal

449
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,799
one-way hash functions which is proposed

450
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,200
by Noah young in 1989

451
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,740
so a universal hash function or wolf

452
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,260
also known as Target Collision resistant

453
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,919
hash function is a kit harsh family here

454
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,679
denoted by C Sub C with the following

455
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,440
two properties first one is shrinking

456
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
meaning the output lens should be

457
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,539
shorter than the input lens and we also

458
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,760
want it to be dark to satisfy Target

459
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,039
Collision resistance meaning for any

460
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,160
efficient adversary a if a first can

461
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,299
beat on some Target X and then

462
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,880
given a uniform qz it should be hard to

463
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,179
find another Collision X Prime which

464
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,059
collides with X under CZ

465
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,000
so um Noah young showed that one-way

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,419
function plus gives rise to digital

467
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,720
signature so this shows that although

468
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,660
wolf is a relaxation of in resistance

469
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,960
one-way Collision resistant function it

470
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,020
still preserves some usefulness

471
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,140
and the nature rampulture that wolves

472
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,880
can be based on one-way functions so

473
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
combined together a digital signature

474
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,039
can be built from solid one-way

475
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,660
functions

476
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,660
so another useful fact is that universal

477
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,880
language function can be easily

478
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,400
constructed from an unkeyed function f

479
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,320
that is shrinking and collision

480
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,960
resistant on random inputs this means

481
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,960
given random input X it should be hard

482
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,559
to find Collision X such that X Prime

483
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,919
such that f x equals to f x Prime so

484
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,280
from such an F it is easy to build a

485
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,720
wolf so let's see the x equal to f z x

486
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,860
or this is bit X or X so we have if x if

487
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,140
f is Collision resistant on random

488
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,140
inputs then you see they defined in this

489
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,240
way is a wolf

490
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,600
so uh it is natural to ask about the

491
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,059
efficiency of the construction of wolf

492
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,700
from one-way functions so there are

493
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,160
three major efficiency measures the

494
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,799
first one is the key lens k n and where

495
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,140
n is the input length of the one-way

496
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,780
function and the second one is number of

497
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,280
course during the underlying while we

498
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,380
function and the second is the third one

499
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,260
is adaptivity meaning that whether the

500
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,179
invocation of one-way function are

501
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,880
dependent of the output of previous

502
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,580
course to the one-way function so if the

503
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,260
cost to the one we function are made

504
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,080
parallel are parallel so we say this

505
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
construction is non-adaptive

506
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,140
so our first result is a long adaptive

507
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,780
construction of wolf from one arbitrary

508
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,000
Runway functions and compared to

509
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,419
previous constructions we our

510
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,600
construction made fewer number of course

511
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,840
although at the cost of longer seat

512
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,700
we mentioned that this is the first lung

513
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,820
adaptive construction as a result it can

514
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,580
be implemented in nc1 with f oral

515
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,039
cookies and combined with a famous

516
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,240
result a ak-06 assuming the one-way

517
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,720
function f is computable in nc1 we can

518
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
compile our Universal hash function to

519
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
nc0

520
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,860
so

521
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,960
um but but however uh also we get a long

522
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,720
adaptive construction this is a

523
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,360
parameter still looks and far from

524
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,080
unsatisfactory so we ask we ask what are

525
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,299
the right construction should be look

526
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,440
like

527
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,360
so this can be answered by looking into

528
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,000
another primitive which is a pseudo

529
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,860
random generator because the

530
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,780
construction

531
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,940
of pseudo random generator and the

532
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,919
wolves are from one wave function are

533
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,320
very similar I will demonstrate I will

534
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,080
demonstrate the similarity with the case

535
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,600
of regular Runway functions so a one-way

536
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,419
function is regular if every image has

537
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,440
the same number of three images so uh a

538
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,820
result in 22 by marzon and John was also

539
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,460
the author of this paper they give this

540
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,380
the following construction so let's take

541
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,620
an independent input X1 through xn and

542
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,640
the repair X1 with FX2 X2 with fx3 and

543
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,580
all the way down to x minus 1 and the f

544
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,480
x n and we we hash some we hash some

545
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,080
bits out of each pair so here H is some

546
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,500
simple hash function so note that each

547
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,640
pair has real entropy exactly and given

548
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,179
other parts of the output so if we hash

549
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,240
out more bits the output should be

550
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,720
longer than input so we get a prg on the

551
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
other hand if we hash out fewer bits the

552
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
function the output is shorter than the

553
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
input we get our shrinking function and

554
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,679
we can prove that this is a collision

555
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,460
resistance this G prime or one thing is

556
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,640
that in the PRT construction we drop the

557
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,179
unpaired FX1 and xn they are unpaired so

558
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,059
which often while in the

559
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,760
a hash function comes in the net later

560
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,360
one we keep we output f x 1 and x and

561
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,440
but since we hash fewer bits on each

562
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,360
pair we still get a shrinking function

563
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,679
so we can prove G Prime is is Collision

564
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,559
resistant on random inputs then it can

565
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,360
be easily turned into a wolf

566
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,280
so it is very surprising that there is

567
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,340
no efficiency gap between prg and

568
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,440
Universal hash function if the one-way

569
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,020
function is regular moreover this

570
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,940
construction is these constructions are

571
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,340
somewhat tight because there is a much

572
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,000
lower Bound by honesting and senka in

573
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,240
they had they prove both for prg and the

574
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,400
Wolf so the number of course are tight

575
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,299
in the case of regular function so um

576
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:55,559
this this is this gap between prg and

577
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,480
wolf in the arbitrary when we function

578
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,419
case is quite surprising so in order to

579
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,059
close in this Gap we introduce another

580
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,760
construction uh which is very very

581
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,000
similar to the HRV prg construction uh

582
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,880
this prg construction is the state of

583
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,100
the art PRT construction from a one-way

584
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,400
function but we cannot prove that this

585
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,600
this construction is Wolf

586
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,640
so we prove that it is an almost roof

587
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,159
which is a relaxation we'll I'll

588
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,960
introduce later

589
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,240
so let's get into more details about the

590
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,820
constructions so in order to demonstrate

591
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,299
our roof construction I would like to

592
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,260
introduce a framework called

593
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,799
computational entropy this framework is

594
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,140
for constructing Primitives from one

595
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,419
arbitrary especially arbitrary Runway

596
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,480
functions so starting with I'm

597
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,820
arbitrating with function f we first

598
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,580
compute a construct a computational

599
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,159
another function G which is called

600
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,740
computational entropy generator and by

601
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,440
them by manipulating entropy and do some

602
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,020
extraction step we get our we get

603
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,080
Primitives like prg wolf Etc so this

604
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,620
looks uh abstract let's take a prg the

605
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,919
hre prg construction as a concrete

606
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,679
example so in their construction they

607
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,840
first build some function G which has

608
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,400
next bit pseudoentropy this means if we

609
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,380
denote Z the random variable of GX by Z

610
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,779
where X is uniform a uniform random

611
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,820
input so Z is computationally

612
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,020
indistinguishable from some other

613
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,559
variable Y in a bitwise manner and

614
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,919
moreover y has more entrepidency so uh

615
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,039
you can you can see in this I'm gonna

616
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,620
run this expectation is taken on a

617
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,380
random index if you if you replace the y

618
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,520
i by z i you will get exactly uh entropy

619
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,700
of Z over L but we have an entropy over

620
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,760
Z entropy of Z over L plus Delta this

621
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,500
means on average each bet each bit

622
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,960
exhibits some extra Delta to the entropy

623
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,919
so next we want to extract this kind of

624
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,900
turn this kind of to the entropy into

625
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,120
pseudo random beats then we'll get then

626
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,620
we will get a prg so this is the HRV prg

627
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,640
construction proceed in four steps so

628
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,200
the first step is repetition meaning

629
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,020
that we take many independent copies of

630
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,980
this G and arrange like a matrix they

631
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,159
have Q There are Q rows and t t copies

632
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,880
in each row since Each G has L is a

633
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,220
little bit long we have in total T times

634
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,260
L colons

635
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,200
and the second step is add a random

636
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,559
shift to each colon so this this aims to

637
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,260
average the colons because after this

638
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,480
random shift when you look at one colon

639
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,100
the index is in this colon in each block

640
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,760
in each small block is uniformly

641
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,820
distributed from 1 to L so this

642
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,919
corresponds to the second bullet here

643
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,400
you can see we have

644
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,260
roughly we have each colon has more

645
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,179
pseudoentropies than its real entropy

646
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,659
then we can use some extractor to

647
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,059
extract the pseudo entropy get more to

648
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,640
the random beats than input before that

649
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,080
there are a little bit detail because

650
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
you can see in the picture on the

651
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,820
rightmost side and left the most there

652
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,520
are some colon they are unfilled so we

653
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,279
just simply drop these colons and hash

654
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,620
some bits out of each colon then we get

655
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,940
a prg

656
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,419
this is HR reconstruction so previous

657
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,360
wolf constructions also fit into this

658
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,100
framework they Define something called

659
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,220
inaccessible entropy so it is natural to

660
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,620
to consider whether we can Define the

661
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,200
next B version of this in excess of

662
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,020
entropy and the right constructing our

663
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,200
mind is something similar to the HRV prg

664
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,240
construction so more more precisely

665
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,159
it's very similar to the regular

666
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,440
function constructions from regular

667
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,580
function we consider if we instead of

668
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,340
dropping this unpopulated colons without

669
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,520
without we simply output them and for

670
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,820
each colon we have fewer bits so this is

671
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,700
very similar to the regular

672
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,899
constructions from regular only

673
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,419
functions so we might think this could

674
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,799
be a roof but somehow but we cannot

675
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,600
prove it we only improve we introduce

676
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,940
next something called Next bits and

677
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,760
visual entropy ensure that this is an

678
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,919
almost roof yeah there is a little bit

679
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,539
Gap here

680
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,779
so I will introduce the two Notions in

681
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,760
order the first one is next bit on

682
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,299
reachable entropy means that uh if we

683
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,580
say this function G has next been

684
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,919
unreachable entropy Delta U for every

685
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,640
index we have some inputs such that it

686
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,740
is hard to flip the ice speed while

687
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,820
staying inside the UI here x is a random

688
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,179
input L is I is a random index and the X

689
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,360
Prime is the output of the inverter the

690
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,980
adversary

691
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,419
so uh this this is uh looks a little bit

692
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,220
uh uh hard but it basically says the

693
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,260
adversary cannot manipulate the eye

694
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,179
speed of X of GX so the second items is

695
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,640
the

696
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,340
unmanipulatable bits are abundant so U

697
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,980
is large meaning that we have more on

698
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,020
unmanipulatable bits then it should have

699
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,140
information theoretically so if you see

700
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,279
this because the entropy of GX is at

701
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,700
most M because the the the input length

702
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,760
is M and we have L bit output so there

703
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,539
should be L minus M uh bits that the

704
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,360
adversary cannot manipulate cannot flip

705
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,380
this bit while fixing the prefix but we

706
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,320
have a Delta more unmanaged relatable

707
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,559
bits this is where the uh where we get

708
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,240
our advantage

709
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,580
so the third third item is quite uh

710
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,500
technical so I will get not get into

711
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,679
that but our idea is that we can use a

712
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,340
very similar generator that and prove

713
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,580
that the satisfied all those three

714
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,500
conditions so our next bit unreachable

715
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,140
generator is very similar to the HRV

716
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,620
next bit pseudoentropy generator so in

717
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,299
their pseudo entropy generator the

718
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:49,260
output FX and the hash of X by some hash

719
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,020
function then in our construction we

720
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,020
just add a more hash to F we're also

721
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,679
hash F so they are quite similar

722
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,380
so uh so after using this next bit

723
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,240
unreachable entreprene notion we can

724
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,880
prove that this construction is indeed

725
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,159
an almost roof so what is an almost

726
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,320
tooth it means that there is a

727
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,840
negligible fraction of inputs which are

728
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,720
bad inputs such that the adversary

729
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,360
actually can find Collision X Prime but

730
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,000
only from this small set

731
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,340
um this looks weird at first The Columns

732
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,159
because anyway the adversary can't find

733
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,260
the Collision although it's in this

734
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,840
small set but we have the following

735
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,840
justification because we notice that the

736
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,600
hre prg construction is actually an

737
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,080
almost prg so they actually prove that

738
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,440
there is a also a small set B such that

739
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,679
conditioned on the input seat is not in

740
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,380
this B they are the cons the output of

741
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,580
their construction G is computationally

742
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,380
indistinguishable from uniform Beach

743
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,240
but as you can see the computational

744
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,100
indisting wishability is quite robust

745
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,740
you can just remove this condition you

746
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,799
not in B Because B is very small it's

747
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,980
still a this statistical distance is

748
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,500
still very small it's increased by a

749
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,380
negligible amount so this this is this

750
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,480
does not affect anything so fortunately

751
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,919
almost prg is is trivially a prg so but

752
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,559
this is clearly not the case for Wolf

753
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,779
because if you have a we have a small

754
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,760
set of bad inputs and the adversary

755
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,980
can't find the Collision as you see

756
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,799
somehow somewhat worse case manner

757
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,720
interestingly our non-adaptive roof

758
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,220
construction can be derived from almost

759
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,899
the construction almost the wolf

760
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,159
construction by simple modifications so

761
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,019
in order to turn this into a wolf we

762
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,360
just use large qnt meaning that we have

763
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,940
more copies uh of course it's this this

764
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,360
is less efficient and instead of hashing

765
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,240
single a single colon each time we Hash

766
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,720
a block a l time Q block and we can

767
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,879
prove that this the construction is

768
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,980
Collision resistant and random inputs

769
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,260
and then we get a wolf by the standard

770
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,740
transformation

771
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:18,719
so finally we give some open questions

772
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,239
uh first of all of course we conjecture

773
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,119
that our almost wolf construction is a

774
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,940
full-fledged one universal hash function

775
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,000
so maybe we need to modify our next bit

776
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,359
unreachable entropy definition to give a

777
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,940
more exact characterization

778
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,800
um yeah and the second thing is that

779
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,619
maybe a more natural computational

780
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,179
entropy generator can be used for

781
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,839
example here GX is just f x and x so

782
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,739
this because this generator is used by

783
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:52,080
vz12 to construct a prg

784
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,300
another direction is to prove lower

785
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,699
bounds on Black Box constructions from

786
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,920
one-way function both on the seed lens

787
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,540
and the number of course and both for

788
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,420
prg and the Wolves this is already done

789
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,000
for regular Runway function case but in

790
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,460
the case of arbitrary function there is

791
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,099
no match lower bound

792
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,680
yeah thank you and I'm happy to take

793
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,810
questions

794
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,940
[Applause]

795
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,140
for the audience

796
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,060
okay then I

797
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,040
I have a question

798
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,160
um so this is one way on random inputs

799
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,859
right well the the results you're

800
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,140
presenting are one way on random inputs

801
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,359
or you're working with random inputs

802
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,540
right uh no there is uh you can simply

803
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,880
tell that the Collision results and

804
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,579
random inputs to a wolf a standard

805
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,200
transformation what happens if the

806
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,540
inputs are not entirely random they

807
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,520
share a few bits but are different in

808
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,260
other bits

809
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,099
uh I think this is uh if you you can

810
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,020
still use the transformation but maybe

811
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,359
it would not be a wolf I think okay

812
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,700
so it's the no more questions that's the

813
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,740
thank the speaker again okay thank you

814
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,619
so the speaker for the third session

815
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,920
okay

816
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,079
so the next talk is

817
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,020
sorry

818
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,520
xocb Beyond birthday bound secure

819

authenticated encryption mode with trait

820
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,440
one computation and the speaker did not

821
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,200
come to speak to me before so I will ask

822
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,119
the speaker to present himself and the

823
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,740
co-authors because I don't want to get

824
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,480
the names wrong

825
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,020
hello this is and I will introduce about

826
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,260
our paper xocb Beyond birthday bound

827
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,300

with rate one computation

829
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,980
this is a joint work with dungeon bow

830
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,599
for Akiko you know

831
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,280
before we start we give an overview of

832
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,599
this paper

833
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,820
we present xocb

834
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,280
or New Blood sniper mode of operation

835
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,460
for non-spaced authenticated encryption

836
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,180
xocb has the following features first in

837
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,540
mostly follows the structure of OCB

838
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,640
second it has beyond the birthday Bond

839
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,640
security and third it is parallel

840
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,020
designer with rate one computation

841
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,619
first I will introduce about the OCB OCB

842
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,760
was first proposed in this year's 2001.

843
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,579
or OCB mode is the most widely used

844
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,000
seminar scheme due to its Pro efficiency

845
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,500
and the security

846
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,839
the main point of city is adding the

847
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,420
random masking value to the input and

848
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,579
the output of the plus Cipher

849
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,859
why these are why these random varios

850
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,920
are important because of the Collision

851
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,780
Collision means that there are same

852
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,060
values to the input of the blood Cipher

853
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,520
in different blocks

854
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,079
and this makes all the adversary to

855
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,480
easily do not distinguished attack

856
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,960
so collisions should be prevented

857
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,040
this or to that the masking should be

858
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
distinct

859
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,200
oh and generate photo from the

860
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,520
reasonable scheme

861
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,280
and this OCB has the birthday Bond

862
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,420
security

863
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,240
however the computational power and the

864
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,040
amount of data have been increased

865
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,300
recently

866
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,200
in particular exabyte 10 to the 18 day

867
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,619
byte data is already in use and databyte

868
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,160
10 to the 21 byte data is in near future

869
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,680
in this case just birthday bound

870
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,320
security might not be enough

871
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
therefore a higher level of security is

872
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,540
desirable called Beyond birthday bound

873
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,800
security

874
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
then how can he improve the security

875
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,720
here is here is an example

876
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,140
this is xrp or pseudo-random function

877
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,720
if we give a message the message is

878
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,079
concatenated with 0 and 1 and each of

879
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,960
them are fed to the permutation

880
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,320
and the result is xor of two outputs

881
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,140
and xrp is a secure store random

882
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,079
function of 202 to the N queries

883
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,020
if we use this construction it might be

884
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,540
possible to make encryption mode having

885
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,060
beyond the birth default security

886
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,300
and one of them is z e and C

887
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,599
NC uses nonce and increasing its one by

888
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,500
one by one and each of them are better

889
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,960
input of the plus Cipher and the output

890
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,900
of the first block is added to the to

891
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,760
the other output

892
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,220
and these values are used as the key

893
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,200
stream of the message

894
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,720
since there are no collision between two

895
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,660
blocks in one encryption and the key

896
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,720
streams can be seen as xor of two output

897
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,020
of the black Cipher so CNC has the

898
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,660
beyond the birth bounce security

899
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,900
however CNC is itself is not

900
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,420
authenticated encryption the main reason

901
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,300
that CNC cannot be authenticated

902
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,900
encryption is the message are not fed to

903
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,020
the input of the plug Cipher

904
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,780
so it cannot authenticate based on the

905
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,960
security of black Cipher so CNC uses

906
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,540
hash based Mac

907
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,700
to authenticate

908
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,359
then to obtain a authenticated

909
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,520
encryption having Beyond person bound

910
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,740
security we have designed three cities

911
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,300
as follows

912
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,700
first is accelerating two outputs of the

913
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,579
Vlog Cipher and second is the message

914
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,040
should be fed to the input of the block

915
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,320
Cipher

916
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,880
by this or design principles or we

917
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,920
designed xlc as follows

918
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,520
it is similar to OCB but there is one

919
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,599
additional layer

920
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,400
layer and this value is generated from

921
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,400
the first block with encrypting zero and

922
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,740
this value is added to every message

923
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,380
encryption block so site does all the

924
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,980
Cyber text can be seen or xor of two

925
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,460
outputs of the block ciphers

926
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,200
but there is on us so we can expect or

927
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
xocb has beyond the birthstone security

928
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
but there is one problem

929
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,780
unlike CNC there might be some

930
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,960
collisions between two blocks and as I

931
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,480
said it is very critical to the security

932
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,260
so it is important that the other birth

933
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,599
salary is hard to make correlation

934
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,820
between two blocks so the math Kings

935
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,400
should be carefully constructed

936
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,820
to do that we or generated math skills

937
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,240
as follows first using CNC star we

938
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,240
generated three random values using

939
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,820
using these three random values we

940
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,880
constructed each masking as follows

941
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,640
using this masking scheme we can leave

942
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,040
at least one random value between any

943
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,240
two blocks

944
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,440
so we can avoid the Collision

945
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,099
now we give a proof sketch

946
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,859
we used H coefficient technique for the

947
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,140
probability to get a good transcription

948
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,839
the ideal world we use extended mirror

949
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,040
Theory twice

950
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,619
the first is for the evaluations in The

951
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,839
Mask generations and message encryptions

952
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,660
and second is for evaluations in the

953
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,300
tech Generations

954
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,460
so what is the edge connection technique

955
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,980
H coefficient technique is a special

956
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,200
technique that upper bounds the or the

957
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,880
best area distinguishing Advantage

958
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,339
between a rear construction and each

959
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,319
either counterpart

960
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,079
after the adversary finished the queries

961
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,079
the adversary gets a transcript which

962
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,420
consists of all the information the

963
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,160
addressary has obtained during the

964
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,420
attack

965
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,940
in our proof the order Cricket also

966
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,819
gives the evaluations determined in the

967
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,579
chord phase in the real world the Oracle

968
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,579
gives the real evaluations and in the

969
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,380
either world the Oracle gives the

970
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,040
evaluations by a certain process

971
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,680
then we can divide the set of or

972
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,020
possible transcripts into two subsets

973
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,660
good transcripts and the other is bad

974
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,160
transcripts

975
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,800
if their exit exist non-negative numbers

976
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,040
Epsilon 1 and Epsilon 2 satisfy these

977
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,079
conditions then we can Bound for

978
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,180
distinguishing advantage

979
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,540
in our proof the important part is or

980
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,180
bounding the probability to get good

981
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,319
transcripts in the ideal world

982
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,140
to do that we use the Builder Theory

983
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,119
mirror theory is a very powerful tool to

984
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,760
estimate the number of solutions to a

985
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,280
certain type of system of equations

986
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,900
look at this picture

987
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,619
this is similar to xrp and there are two

988
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,800
inputs a i and b i and there are two

989
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,760
unknown unknown values x i and y i which

990
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,980
is the output of the block Cipher

991
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,520
so we can induce the equation that x i x

992
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,880
or y i equals jet I

993
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,520
and we correct these equations

994
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,060
or by offline below Theory we can or

995
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,920
estimate the number of solutions of

996
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,319
solutions to it

997
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,720
however in the decrease in queries there

998
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,599
might be both which means no in from no

999
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,220
information

1000
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,640
so in this case we can also we should

1001
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,819
also include the known equations as well

1002
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:04,200
as equations

1003
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,200
this is extended major Theory and we

1004
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,160
used or product

1005
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,220
yeah so in our proof the extra EXO Civic

1006
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,920
construction can be seen as the xor of

1007
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,980
two output and each ciphertext can be

1008
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,180
can induce those equation x0 X1 X1

1009
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,040
equals C1 XY Delta 1 X Y Delta 2. and we

1010
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,079
can collect those equations for already

1011
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,900
all the cipher text blocks

1012
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,579
then the probability that those

1013
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,040
evaluations are determined is the

1014
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,099
inverse of the number of the solutions

1015
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,560
for the detailed proof or please check

1016
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,240
the free version of the tape over the

1017
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,099
paper

1018
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,800
as a result xocb has the following

1019
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,859
security Q is total number of queries

1020
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:55,140
and sigma is total number of quality

1021
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,319
blocks of n bit and L is maximum query

1022
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,359
length in N bit blocks

1023
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:03,180
and the reader term is colored as the

1024
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,420
red color and by this lead term we can

1025
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,760
conclude that xocb has Beyond birthday

1026
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,000
bound security when R is smaller than 2

1027
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,060
to the N over 2 and has 12 over 3 bit

1028
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,460
security when maximum query length is

1029
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,660
constant

1030
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,960
this might not be a practical problem in

1031
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,480
real world applications since many

1032
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,220
practical communication protocols

1033
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,880
specify a maximum painkillings called

1034
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,819
MTU

1035
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:35,460
and here is a comparison table with our

1036
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,579
with other schemes

1037
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:40,319
you can check that xlcb has good

1038
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,040
advantage in rate and security

1039
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,760
we also implemented xlcb in deep in two

1040
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,300
platforms the performance of xocb is

1041
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,240
quite close to OCB and faster than CIP

1042
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,980
for 6 x 64 platforms with asni and for

1043
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,380
8-bit AVR the initialization

1044
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,839
initialization cost is not negligible

1045
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,859
and affects the total performance

1046
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:11,040
so in conclusion xlcv is a new

1047
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,780
authenticated encryption mode which

1048
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,319
mostly follows the structure of OCB

1049
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,480
it has a quantitatively stronger

1050
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,940
security than the seminar OCB While

1051
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,619
inerting most of the efficiency

1052
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,240
advantages

1053
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,400
we can also consider further research

1054
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
topics as optimizing the scheme to

1055
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,560
reduce computational overhead reducing

1056
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,420
those length contribution to the bound

1057
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,300
or more comprehensive benchmarks
