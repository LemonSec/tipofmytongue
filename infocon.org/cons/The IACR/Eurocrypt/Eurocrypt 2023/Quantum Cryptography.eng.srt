1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,100
okay then um

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,560
welcome everyone to the last session for

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,840
today we are looking at a Quantum

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,300
cryptography and the first talk is on

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,920
public key encryption a secure key

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,699
Leasing and Leo

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,020
Niche is giving the check

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,520
sorry

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,039
oh thank you for the introduction I'm

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,720
going to talk about public key

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,300
encryption with security reason this is

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,300
this is a joint work with shuwita fuyuki

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,640
Shota and takas

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,239
this is a brief summary of our work we

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,100
introduced a new notion called the

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,260
public encryption with the key listing

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,840
and we achieve it from standard public

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,020
encryption we also extend the notion to

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,940
the attribute based encryption and the

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,680
public key functional inclusion setting

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,800
and Achieve them from standard Abe and

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,760
public TFE respectively

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,879
okay so let's first let's see the

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,739
functionality of public encryption with

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,680
the second key listing

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,159
first of all it is hard to prove that we

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,400
delete digital information since we can

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,979
keep a copy we can copy our classical

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,560
information let's consider the following

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,900
following situation uh

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,939
from Ice

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,600
and at some point Bob litan uh Bob

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,900
claims that I returned your addiction

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,979
key to Iris however uh it is hard to

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,020
prove that uh

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,780
Bob delete the description key because

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,740
he can keep a copy of the decision key

38
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,460
there it is impossible to achieve a

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,600
secure Reason by classical cryptography

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,979
however a quantum mechanics enable us to

41
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,560
enable us to prove duration or

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,700
preventing copy production

43
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,900
so uh let's see the functionality of

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,599
public encryption with security listing

45
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,319
uh

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,599
we we need to achieve this this

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
primitive we need the power of quantum

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,500
computation

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,160
so R is generate a public key and public

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,739
encryption key and Quantum decoration

51
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,080
key and a verification key

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,300
uh here uh verification key a

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,519
verification key can be public or

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
private but in this work we consider

55
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,859
private key private verification key

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,099
both decoration key from Iris and

57
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,060
someone send us hypertext to Bob and

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,379
then Bob can decorate the Cyber text

59
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,140
after that at some point Bob returned

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,620
the quantum decoration key to Iris

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,519
and Aries checks whether the return

62
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
decoration key is buried or Not by using

63
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,560
the verification key

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
if the returned decression key is buried

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
then after that even Bob received

66
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
another ciphertext and the public

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,019
English public encryption key uh the Bob

68
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,920
cannot decorate the cyphatics anymore

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,500
this is a pke with key racing

70
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,400
there are a few previous Works uh single

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,739
digital encryption is public key

72
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,379
encryption whose decryption keys are

73
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,159
quantum States and copy protected

74
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,420
however uh to achieve this strong

75
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,519
cryptographic primitive we need a strong

76
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,980
cryptographic assumptions such as one

77
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,319
shot signages and extractable witness

78
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,959
encryption or post content in

79
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,340
distinguishability obstigation

80
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
in security listing uh

81
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,779
Chicago and my myself

82
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,279
introduce the notion of secret key

83
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,079
functional inclusion with secure key

84
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,600
reason and achieve a bonded Collision

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,820
resistance scheme from one wave function

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,400
and in general Uncle novel cryptography

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,460
implies cryptography with secure

88
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,300
breathing so uh single digital inclusion

89
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,120
in price public encryption with secure

90
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,800
key listing which can be achieved by a

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
postal Quantum indistinguishability

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
obfuscation

93
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
so

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,780
our main question is can we achieve

95
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,240
public encryption with secure listing

96
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,880
from standard assumption if we assume

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,699
indistinguishable Obsession we can

98
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,280
achieve this premium but our question is

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
whether we can achieve this notion from

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,180
standard assumption

101
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,240
and the answer is yes we can achieve

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,699
this new this primitive from standard

103
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,540
public key encryption

104
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,060
so let's move to how to achieve a public

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,919
encryption with security key listing

106
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,539
from standard public encryption

107
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,280
uh before uh I present our construction

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,380
uh I I'm explaining the security notion

109
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,060
for public generation with secure key

110
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,759
listing which is called security against

111
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,039
key leasing attacks

112
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
the Challenger generate a public

113
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,300
encryption key and Quantum decoration

114
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,300
key and the verification key

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,360
the adversary receives uh the the

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,340
encryption key and the quantum

117
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,919
decoration key

118
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
in the indistinguishability case the

119
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,100
adversary sends two printers to the

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,660
Challenger

121
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,139
and the adversary can send a possibly

122
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,240
malformed decoration key as a

123
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,520
verification query

124
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,940
the Challenger answers whether this

125
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,259
query the decision key is valid or not

126
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,139
and if the adversary send the body

127
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,120
decoration key under the verification

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
key then the Challenger generator

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,860
challenges cyphatic is understanding to

130
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,240
the adversary

131
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,620
in the in this in distinction PD case

132
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,440
the other bus sorry guess is uh which

133
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,060
was encrypted uh printex m0 or M1 and in

134
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,120
the in the one way in this case the

135
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
other bars are tried to recover the

136
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
entire text

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,560
here is load map so we want to achieve

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,139
uh in indistinguishability notion uh

139
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,800
against the key listing attack

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,460
from standard in the CPA secure pke

141
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,800
first we construct the one-way care less

142
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,919
secure PK from in the CPAC apke and then

143
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,979
we upgrade one-way carry secure pke to

144
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,740
indicate less secure PK

145
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,860
let's see the first part from next next

146
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,840
right

147
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,500
the construction idea is very simple we

148
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
use two key pairs of standard public key

149
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,759
encryption

150
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,000
uh the decoration key is is a super

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,819
portion of two decryption keys dk0 on

152
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,500
the dk1

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,220
and ciphertext consists of two cyphatics

154
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,639
of the same print x m and uh two

155
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,759
different encryption Keys EK 0 and ek1

156
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,039
we can decrypt this ciphertext by

157
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,020
applying a decision key in the

158
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,300
superposition way and the equation

159
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,120
result are the same because uh these two

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,520
cyphatics does the encryption of the

161
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,160
same print text so uh the decryption key

162
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
does not collapse even after we apply

163
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,940
the division key

164
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,280
and we can also verify the decoration

165
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,099
Key by using uh measurement by this

166
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,539
projection uh

167
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,419
which is generated from two decision key

168
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,680
dk0 on the dk1

169
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,240
so before uh

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,059
I explain how to achieve a full one-way

171
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,120
carrier security we I explained how to

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
achieve half one-way carry security

173
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,159
which means uh the adversary wins the

174
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,919
game at most half plus negligible

175
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
probability

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
Okay so

177
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,040
we can consider the following trivial

178
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,279
strategy uh The Advisory measure the

179
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,959
decision key and get uh dkzer or dk1

180
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,300
by measuring this uh the superposition

181
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,920
decryption key we can obtain indicator

182
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,200
or dk1

183
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,820
and uh

184
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,640
use this strategy the adversary can pass

185
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,459
the verification with probability half

186
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,580
and it can also break the security

187
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,660
because the adversary can recover a

188
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,339
or dk1

189
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,980
and actually this strategy is optimal we

190
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,459
can show this but the big question is

191
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,880
how to show this strategy is optimal

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,100
actually this task is quite non-tolebr

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,360
and we show this by using a new security

194
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
notion called consistent or inconsistent

195
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,779
security

196
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,980
so before uh uh I uh so behold or sorry

197
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,000
uh to achieve one-way carrier secure pke

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
we use coic

199
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,339
precisely speaking we need a stronger

200
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,220
version of Coit security but to make

201
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,620
this presentation simple I use the

202
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
normal notion of coic security in this

203
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,940
talk

204
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,940
okay from next slide I'm explaining how

205
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,519
to achieve one-way carries kpk from this

206
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,480
new security notion

207
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,240
four three

208
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,939
well maybe back to

209
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,860
sorry so uh first I explain what is

210
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,140
consistent or inconsistent security

211
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,260
the challenges generated two PPS of

212
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,380
public encryption decreaser dk1 and EK

213
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,920
zero dk1 and the the adversary received

214
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,399
a description key super portion of dk0

215
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,660
on the dk1

216
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,600
and also receive the two encryption key

217
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,360
eks around the K1

218
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
and the adversary can send a

219
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,579
verification query as uh into carrier

220
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,140
security or one-way carrier security

221
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,240
and after the the verification query the

222
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
other password is in the two print texts

223
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,720
to the Challenger

224
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
then the Challenger flips two random

225
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,279
coins A and B and generate cytics ct0 it

226
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,100
is the encryption of M sub a

227
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,240
and it also generates cyphatic ct1 which

228
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,320
is encryption of M sub a X or B

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,920
which means if B is equal to zero these

230
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,100
two psychotics are consistent however B

231
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,320
is equal to one then these two cyphatics

232
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
are inconsistent

233
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,180
the challenges in the both side parties

234
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,300
to the adversary and the other sorry uh

235
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,339
guesses uh bit B which means uh the

236
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,380
adversary try to distinguish these two

237
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,220
cyphatics are consistent or inconsistent

238
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,940
this is a cyc security

239
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,220
by using this secreted notion we can

240
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,579
prove that the simple construction

241
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,800
satisfy one verification query and the

242
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,839
half one-way carrier security

243
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,839
so here uh I showed the security

244
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,420
experiment of a one-way carry security

245
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
for to the for the simple two key

246
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,440
constructions

247
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,600
the adversary received the addiction key

248
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,360
uh super potion indication key and can

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
send the verification key query once and

250
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
if the query is the address in the

251
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,700
barrier detection key then the

252
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,860
challenges send the two ciphertext

253
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,579
which is the encryption of M

254
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,860
uh first we change slightly change the

255
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,500
security game uh first we default the

256
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,620
measurement of the equation key

257
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,660
by using by using the default

258
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,880
measurement principle this does not

259
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,760
incur any difference

260
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,300
and next we relax the winning condition

261
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,620
we uh

262
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,399
choose uniformly random print x m Tudor

263
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,880
and if the adversary output M or emitter

264
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,160
then the adversary wins

265
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,260
this just increases the winning

266
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,360
probability

267
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,740
next we can apply coic security here uh

268
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,880
so originally ct1 is encryption M or M

269
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,079
however now ct1 is English of M Tudor

270
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,920
we can uh which even if uh we change

271
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,459
cyphatic cd1 like this uh it's it's

272
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,620
indistinguishable due to the cyc

273
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,800
security

274
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
and lastly uh we measure the query

275
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,779
decoration Key by using a computational

276
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,380
basis then if the direction key is

277
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,680
buried uh the measurement result is dk0

278
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,399
or dk1

279
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,480
in the last game if the adversary uh

280
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,100
wins the security game then uh the the

281
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,860
other battery output printext M or M

282
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,660
Tudor and by using measurement we can

283
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,779
get dk0 or dk1 from the queried uh

284
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,399
decryption key

285
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,839
however this contradicts to the

286
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,000
one-wayness of the of the the encryption

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,820
scheme which is in part implied by cyc

288
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,339
security we can show that we cannot

289
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,680
obtain dk0 and material or dk1m by using

290
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,019
the Bonnet and rhythm

291
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:46,860
so we can obtain half one-way carrier

292
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,240
security

293
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
by using cyc security

294
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,079
so this is a high level overview of our

295
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,220
Construction

296
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,100
however of course uh half security is

297
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,079
not sufficient we want to achieve full

298
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,240
security a full one where a carrier

299
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,279
security uh

300
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,980
we can achieve this by using parallel

301
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,540
adaptation just we use Lambda two Lambda

302
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,980
KPS or Bank public encryption keys and

303
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,180
we encrypt the shares of the printed

304
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,060
and then we can achieve the full one-way

305
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,440
K area security however here we cannot

306
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,760
amplify half security to food Security

307
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,839
in in Black Box way we need to analog

308
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
directly analyze the uh parallelize the

309
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,560
construction

310
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
to approve the through one-way carry

311
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,019
security

312
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,000
so we saw that we can achieve one query

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,180
one-way security from cyck area secure

314
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,440
pke

315
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
and we can upgrade one query one way one

316
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,560
way carry security to one-way carry many

317
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,579
query one-way carrier security by using

318
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,699
the notion of one more unleash Liberty

319
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,360
which I omit in this talk but uh note

320
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,279
that we do not any additional

321
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,260
assumptions for this upgrade

322
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,260
and then we can upgrade one-way carrier

323
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,540
security to in the carrier security by

324
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,680
using the quantum gold life living serum

325
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,199
so the last the last big question how to

326
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,839
achieve uh cyc security

327
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,899
so we use uh one bounded cyphatics

328
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,300
policy functional language and actually

329
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,899
this task is also known tolerable uh

330
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,660
but I omit this part due to the time

331
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,139
limitation sorry but interestingly we

332
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,660
use watermarking extraction technique to

333
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,139
this this Construction

334
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,420
and we know that we can achieve a one

335
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,600
bounded CPAP from standard in CPA secure

336
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,380
pke so we can achieve into carry secure

337
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,959
pke from standard in the CPS secure PK

338
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,000
and

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the the pke with security reasoning to

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,179
to Abe with secreting and the public key

341
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,799
functioning inclusion with secret key

342
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,280
listing and also we can achieve these

343
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,579
Notions by combining by combining

344
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,339
standard Abe or parity functional

345
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,480
engagement with PK with security listing

346
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,900
but uh so sorry I due to the time in

347
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,200
additional iron with these details

348
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,780
let me summarize my talk uh we

349
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,240
introduced the definitions for public

350
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,940
encryption with secret key listing and

351
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,160
we also showed that we can achieve this

352
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,500
new notion from standard public key

353
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,059
encryption

354
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,240
and we also extend this notion to Abe

355
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,740
and the public key functional inclusion

356
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,880
setting

357
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,700
uh there are a few concurrent Works uh

358
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,919
announced that are introduced the notion

359
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,799
of revocable PK which is almost a semi

360
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
same as public encryption with secure

361
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,299
casing

362
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:05,640
they achieved this notion from the aw

363
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,260
assumption so but we use uh more

364
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,900
generation from standard PK

365
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,940
and uh

366
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,460
bus sector

367
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,419
achieved public key functional

368
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,400
encryption with security key listing but

369
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,620
from indistinguishability obscation and

370
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,740
one function sorry there is a small

371
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,020
mistake in this right they don't need a

372
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,000
server explanation sub-exponential

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,140
security for their Construction

374
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,600
that's it please see our ePrint paper

375
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,460
for the detail thank you for your

376
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,640
attention

377
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,450
[Applause]

378
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,720
so do we have any questions from the

379
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,020
audience

380
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,640
so I'm not super familiar with the field

381
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,460
it seems I can give out my my decryption

382
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,740
key exactly once and that seems kind of

383
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,020
inherent in the technique right

384
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,299
so if I want to give it to like party a

385
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,820
and later party B that

386
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,340
no I think we can so if uh once Bob's

387
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Bob returns to the description key to

388
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,699
Iris maybe later artists can uh

389
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,280
uh uh I think we can apply the

390
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,980
well-known now I am transformation in

391
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,980
our setting because our cyphatics are

392
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,020
completely classical so we can use the

393
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,919
standard uh journalist technique so we

394
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,020
did we didn't consider a CCA security

395
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,960
settings in our paper but I think we can

396
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,840
achieve CCA security by using no iron

397
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,860
technique

398
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,059
yeah sex

399
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,679
okay ah

400
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,960
so sorry say it again

401
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,100
yeah

402
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,559
it's hard to say uh

403
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,760
yeah

404
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,640
the the the clearing the problem is out

405
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,460
of scope our work so I I cannot say

406
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,799
about that problem sorry

407
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
all right

408
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,940
then I think another round of applause

409
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,799
and we move to the second tour custom

410
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,860
session thank you so much

411
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,990
[Applause]

412
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,900
um for a second talk we have another

413
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,580
round of breaking and making Quinter

414
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,500
money and how to build it from lattices

415
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,799
and more and the authors couldn't make

416
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,799
it to the conference so um Barack me

417
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,600
Holland is going to give the talk but

418
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,080
yeah

419
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,520
okay thank you for the introduction uh

420
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,440
my name is Barack and haran and this

421
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,880
work is about some new results both

422
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,159
negative and positive about how to

423
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,780
construct Quantum money

424
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,640
specifically how not to build it from

425
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,880
lattices and also a new framework for

426
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,740
building it from uh from what's called

427
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,559
uh walkable invariants as you might have

428
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,840
noticed I'm not one of the authors uh

429
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,580
since they cannot be here they have

430
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,460
asked me to present it on their behalf

431
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,780
uh and you can feel free to ask me

432
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,380
questions uh clarification questions uh

433
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,620
but for any uh more in-depth discussion

434
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,720
I urge you to uh to reach out to the

435
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,380
authors by email

436
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,320
so let's start with some background

437
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
so the uh the quantum no go uh no

438
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,820
cloning theorem states that given an

439
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,880
unknown Quantum State uh it is a a

440
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,280
general uh Quantum State it's impossible

441
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,460
to create two copies of that uh on the

442
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,640
quantum State and uh it's it's been

443
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,980
crucial for the development of uh the

444
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,200
first cryptographic protocols uh

445
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,140
specifically the uh

446
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,120
the uh the protocol of quantum secret

447
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,340
key kind of money uh which was devised

448
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,940
by Weisner in 1970. uh and here the the

449
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,280
banknote uh is the Quantum States that's

450
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,460
unknown to the public and no cloning uh

451
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,720
implies that it's impossible to

452
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,000
counterfeit the spanknote

453
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,799
the problem is that since only the

454
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,440
Creator uh which we call the mint uh

455
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
knows the quantum State uh only they can

456
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
verify and it comes with its own host of

457
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,700
uh of issues including the uh the the

458
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,919
ability to uh to fix the deterioration

459
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,799
in the in in the uh in the make note and

460
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,320
and the other issues uh and this led to

461
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
uh

462
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,260
uh Aaronson in 2009 to uh

463
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,900
to uh Define the notion of publicly

464
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,539
Quantum money uh where in addition to

465
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,860
the quantum State there's the public

466
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,780
verification procedure which means that

467
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,419
anyone can verify

468
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,460
the challenge with this is that with

469
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,320
public verification this means that you

470
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,480
could use brute force to search to find

471
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,280
a valid banknote

472
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
and specifically this means that the

473
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,179
state is known to the attacker

474
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,159
lays the premise of the no cloning

475
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,460
theorem and uh so we need to leverage

476
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,140
cryptography on top of the quantum

477
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,120
information in order to guarantee no

478
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,600
cloning

479
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,740
public economy has been notoriously

480
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,600
challenging to construct with provable

481
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,940
security there have been many proposals

482
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,039
over the years and this is a a

483
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,700
collection of them uh and uh

484
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,140
unfortunately several of them have been

485
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,200
broken and the rest lack security proof

486
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,700
relative to universally accepted

487
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,080
computational assumptions

488
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,340
this work makes progress uh towards

489
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,720
understanding the security of quantum

490
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,659
money uh in three different parts the

491
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,580
first result is an attack on a class of

492
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,100
lattice based schemes uh which includes

493
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,740
a recent candidate by keshin Liu and

494
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,240
Shore

495
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,659
um and specifically uh this attack means

496
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,720
that this uh uh that their scheme is

497
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,940
insecure

498
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,700
the second result is positive uh it's a

499
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,280
framework for building Quantum money uh

500
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,080
with something called uh walkable

501
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,580
invariants

502
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,900
and this work gives sufficient

503
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,720
conditions uh to lead to secure Quantum

504
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,640
money uh and it can be seen as

505
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,039
abstracting one of the main uh remaining

506
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,120
candidates for secure Quantum money uh

507
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,280
due to farhi at all uh Quantum money

508
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,159
from knots and we note that it's an open

509
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,140
uh it's an open problem where whether

510
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,299
they're uh

511
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,860
uh their scheme meets their Association

512
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,400
conditions

513
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,620
and the last one is the uh the last part

514
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,159
is uh they give some new candidate uh

515
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,260
candidates Quantum money uh

516
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,120
instantiations from uh walkable and

517
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,460
variants uh and uh notably one of them

518
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,100
is from uh is a very natural approach

519
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,100
from uh isogenes and uh I'll note that

520
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,620
there's one uh Missing Piece that will

521
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,639
will come back to you later

522
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,020
so first let's talk about how not to

523
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,440
build Quantum money from lattices

524
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,279
so uh lettuces seems to be a a very

525
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,799
natural candidate for uh for for use for

526
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,140
making Quantum monies uh and the

527
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,419
forklore approached uh to making Quantum

528
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,100
money from lattices is roughly as

529
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,980
follows uh so you you have you start

530
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,559
with the verification key uh also known

531
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,600
as the serial number uh which is just a

532
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,100
short wide Matrix uh and uh as well as a

533
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,559
vector Y and they're both defined mud

534
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,120
mud some modulus Q

535
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,080
and the banknote is a superposition of

536
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,440
sorts vectors X such that a DOT x equals

537
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,640
y again mod Q

538
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,179
uh and and note that uh we only consider

539
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,820
a single banknotes but uh this is not a

540
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,460
this is not a weakness because uh you're

541
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,720
using standard techniques you can always

542
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,220
extend to multiple banknotes

543
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,320
so uh due to a work a previous work of

544
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,799
uh Liu and zandry uh this uh this scheme

545
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,559
is insecure and the reason is because uh

546
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,480
of the following attack so the attacker

547
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,419
measures uh the quantum money State uh

548
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,820
in order to get a short Vector X

549
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,299
that's uh that solves the uh 8.x equals

550
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,200
y

551
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,260
EP um and now because X is now a

552
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,220
classical uh string uh the attacker can

553
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,600
make copies of it and specific

554
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
specifically it makes two copies and

555
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,679
pretends that both of them are the valid

556
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
uh are the are these uh are there

557
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,580
banknotes that uh uh the attacker uh

558
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,260
pretends the actor pretends that both of

559
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,480
these are the banknote

560
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,140
um and uh Leon zendry showed that no

561
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,000
verification procedure can distinguish

562
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,580
these no no polynomial time verification

563
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,140
procedure can distinguish these from the

564
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,720
real banknotes uh and then more

565
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,400
technical terms this just means that the

566
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,380
short integer solution hash function is

567
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,120
collapsing

568
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,460
uh and what this means is that this uh

569
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,100
this attack is insecure

570
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,880
uh and the problem uh here is that uh

571
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
distinguishing uh distinguishing these

572
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,179
uh these Bank these uh uh pretend

573
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:52,919
banknotes from the original the the

574
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,620
valid banknote uh requires solving the

575
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,840
LW problem which is uh which is thought

576
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,279
to be hard for uh for quantum computers

577
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,539
um so

578
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:04,080
um

579
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,940
one way that you might think to to fix

580
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,159
this is uh is that you want to make the

581
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,640
lwe problem easier uh and a way to do

582
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,400
this is uh by adding trapdoors to the

583
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,380
verification key and these trap doors

584
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,960
are just uh short vectors in the kernel

585
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,840
of a this is a this is a a common

586
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,179
technique and largest cryptography and

587
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,400
uh the hope is that we can use these for

588
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,320
verification

589
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,419
and for example the very recent scheme

590
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,760
uh from keshen Luann Shore can be viewed

591
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,240
in this way

592
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,380
and uh the contribution of this work is

593
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,580
that

594
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,039
uh in any class any class of schemes

595
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,400
that uses this kind of uh technique is

596
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,140
still insecure

597
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,940
uh note that the previous talk the

598
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,720
previous attack no longer works as is uh

599
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,159
because the track doors can be used to

600
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,380
distinguish a single short vectors A

601
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,000
single short Vector from a superposition

602
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,760
over short vectors but this work shows

603
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,559
that these trapdoors allow new attack

604
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,419
um and it goes as follows so first we do

605
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,159
as before and we measure the states to

606
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,200
get a short Vector X but this time we

607
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,940
need an extra step

608
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,100
uh we use the trap doors to create a

609
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,919
superposition uh with shifts of X by

610
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,100
multiples of the trapdoors

611
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,740
and generalization of uh the Louisiana

612
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,159
result uh shows that no efficient uh

613
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,020
verification procedure can distinguish

614
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,200
this from the valid banknote

615
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,700
and

616
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,299
um

617
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,640
and as as part of showing this the

618
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,880
authors show uh extend the loose Andrew

619
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,000
result to now work for any modulus queue

620
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,100
even ones that are not super polynomial

621
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,380
and what this means is that uh the the

622
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,840
recent candidates construction by keshen

623
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,899
Lou and Shore is in fact insecure

624
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,020
and along the way they also uh uh proves

625
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,600
improve some known results about the

626
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,678
klwe problem

627
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,200
so now uh I don't want to leave you guys

628
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
on uh uh on a pessimistic note so let's

629
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,899
talk about some positive results how do

630
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,480
you build Quantum money

631
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,360
so this work proposes a new framework

632
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,179
called walkable invariance and it goes

633
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,000
roughly as follows uh so the walkability

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,559
variance framework describes the

635
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,980
following setup we consider a set X over

636
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,480
which the quantum money States will be

637
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,659
defined and then in variant I which

638
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,240
gives a label to each hash value a label

639
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,179
or hash value to each element

640
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,820
and these hash values they sort of split

641
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,640
the set into subsets which have the same

642
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,200
invariant value

643
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,580
and uh we now we then allow a family of

644
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,039
index permutations on this set

645
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,260
but we require that the permutations

646
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,360
maintain the invariant

647
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,659
and in other words the elements in the

648
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,480
same subset in the same subsets with

649
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,279
same invariant get mapped back to that

650
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,399
same subset that has the same invariant

651
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,220
so in in other words they uh the uh

652
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,980
these permutations uh the invariant is

653
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,419
invariant under the permutations

654
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,200
to define a Quantum money state we first

655
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,419
choose a random subset with some

656
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,880
invariants let's call it Y and then we

657
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,419
take the uniform superposition uh

658
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,580
over elements in that set to be the

659
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,200
banknote

660
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
the invariance then becomes the the

661
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,980
verification key or the serial number

662
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,240
so now that these States can be sampled

663
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,159
efficiently by the mint by just taking a

664
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,140
uniform superposition over X and then

665
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,880
measuring the uh the outcome of applying

666
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,419
the invariant

667
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,760
this framework also gives a way to

668
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,640
verify the banknote and that's by doing

669
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,620
the following so the first thing that we

670
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,320
do is we tested the support of the

671
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
banknotes is contained uh within the

672
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,880
subset of the property invariant

673
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,159
and then and then second we test that is

674
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,779
unchanged by acting with the random

675
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,820
permutation

676
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,640
and this uses a version of the swap test

677
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,260
note that the second test is what

678
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,000
prevents the measure and copy attack

679
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,080
that we mentioned earlier

680
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,899
and so the main theorem of the paper is

681
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,940
a recipe for proving that walkable and

682
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,580
variant structure gives a rise to secure

683
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,779
Quantum money

684
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:36,240
and for that we need three ingredients

685
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,960
the first is a statistical property

686
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,299
that's a random walk defined by these

687
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,659
permutations mixes

688
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,520
and then we also need two computational

689
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,500
assumptions which we'll mention in the

690
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,760
next two slides

691
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,919
the hardness of pathfinding and

692
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,840
knowledge of path assumption

693
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,820
if the invariant satisfies all three

694
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,520
assumptions then this leads to secure

695
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,059
Quantum money

696
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,399
so the first computational assumption uh

697
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,159
is the hardness of pathfinding

698
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,440
and that's the given two points in the

699
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,600
same subset essentially points to have

700
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,700
the same invariant it's hard to find the

701
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,220
PATH uh that goes between them a path

702
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,380
here is just a sequence of indices such

703
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,480
that the corresponding permutations map

704
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,240
from one point to the other

705
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,059
I note that the mixing property means

706
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:28,980
that there are many short paths between

707
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,659
every two points

708
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,299
and the the hardness of pathfinding just

709
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,760
means that it's hard to find those short

710
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,179
paths

711
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,600
and the second computational assumption

712
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
is called knowledge of path

713
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,179
and before I say what it is just note

714
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,580
that uh given one point it's always

715
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,799
possible to generate a second point with

716
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,779
the same invariant and that's just by

717
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,820
what starting at the first point and

718
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,279
then taking a walk along an arbitrary

719
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,440
path from that point and then you get to

720
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
another point in the uh within the

721
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,640
invariant uh

722
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,159
but the knowledge of path assumption

723
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,000
states that uh this is the only way to

724
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,219
get two points with the same invariance

725
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,739
that is any adversary that outputs two

726
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,899
such points must know a path between

727
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,300
them and specifically given such an

728
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,099
adversary we can extract this path

729
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,580
this framework can be applied to uh

730
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,280
Quantum money from nuts uh the proposal

731
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,899
from uh farhi at all uh from 2012. uh

732
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,820
the 2012 paper merely conjectured

733
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,280
security but gives I gave no formal

734
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,800
proofs of security and in fact before

735
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,379
this work little was known about uh its

736
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,639
security besides just a general

737
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,760
sentiment that uh problems uh dealing

738
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,520
with knots are very hard

739
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,500
um and so this framework allows us to

740
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,540
formalize the necessary conditions for

741
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,680
this proposal being secure

742
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,420
in this uh in this candidate

743
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,060
construction uh X is a set of knot

744
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,520
diagrams under some encoding

745
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,460
uh the permutations are the set of uh uh

746
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,920
writermeister moves

747
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,900
and uh the invariant is the uh is is

748
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,700
just the Alexander polynomial on that

749
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,320
knot which doesn't change uh when uh

750
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,060
when you apply write a Meister moves

751
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,820
and so this scheme is uh this uh this uh

752
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,280
this candidate construction is secure uh

753
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
if the following uh three sufficient

754
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
conditions the the if these three

755
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,560
sufficient conditions that we mentioned

756
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,900
are all met

757
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,800
um

758
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,400
the hardness of pathfinding uh here is

759
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,780
uh

760
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,320
is uh the pathfinding is is just uh uh

761
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,980
the task of finding uh a path uh uh of

762
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,020
reitemeister moves that goes from one

763
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,339
presentation of a knot to another

764
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,040
presentation of the same knot uh and

765
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,800
this is a known hard uh problem uh for

766
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,380
knots the knowledge of path uh

767
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,220
assumption here uh is more uh

768
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,099
is a new assumption uh but is but it

769
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,980
also seems uh plausible

770
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,410
on the other hand

771
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,079
[Music]

772
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:19,619
um

773
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,940
it's unclear uh if uh if if the random

774
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,680
walks mix

775
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,339
and even if it is true uh it will

776
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,920
probably be very hard to to prove uh

777
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,660
because it's related to the known hard

778
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,880
uh problem of bounding the the length of

779
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,420
paths between uh between knots

780
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,440
but in any case uh this uh these these

781
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
all seem uh seem possible uh which means

782
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,920
that that uh this gives uh uh provable

783
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,099
security of this scheme under some uh

784
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,540
some reasonable assumptions

785
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,760
last thing I want to mention is that the

786
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
paper gives some new instantiations of

787
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,640
this framework uh which gives some uh

788
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,160
some some new candidate constructions of

789
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,060
secure Quantum money

790
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,060
uh the first instantiation uh is from

791
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Super singular elliptic curves uh

792
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,440
are the quantum money States or

793
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,839
superposition is over these curves uh

794
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,940
the invariant uh is the number of points

795
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,260
on the Curve

796
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,320
and uh the permutations are low degree

797
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,640
exogenies

798
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,160
so the task of pathfinding here is the

799
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,500
task of computing the esogenes which is

800
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,420
uh widely believed to be hard the

801
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,400
knowledge path is a new assumption

802
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,200
but it's analogous to the knowledge of

803
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,300
exponent assumption in groups which is a

804
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,160
very popular assumption

805
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,680
um and it's plausible but it needs more

806
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,460
cryptanalysis

807
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,260
and mixing follows from widely believed

808
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,740
um uh while the leaf conjectures in uh

809
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,060
in number Theory

810
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,940
and the problem uh the the that's

811
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,339
missing here is uh that it's unknown how

812
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,640
to create uniform superpositions uh over

813
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,859
the uh over these curves and it's

814
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,619
related to the to the major open problem

815
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,079
of obliviously sampling uh super

816
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,220
singular elliptic curves

817
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,820
so

818
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,760
um finally the paper also discusses uh

819
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,320
two other instantiations of the

820
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,140
framework uh the first from

821
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,339
re-randomizable functional encryption

822
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,560
and the second from group actions taken

823
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,660
with the classical Oracle unfortunately

824
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,980
due to time we don't have time to

825
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,359
discuss them but I urge you to see the

826
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,579
paper for uh for more details of these

827
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,160
other constructions

828
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,759
thank you

829
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,419
[Applause]

830
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,520
so do we have any uh clarification or

831
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,680
easy questions for the speaker in the

832
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,759
audience yeah

833
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,800
unfortunately this is something you

834
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,760
don't have to ask the authors

835
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,980
foreign

836
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,800
ly believe that it's that it's a real

837
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,320
thing that we just need to construct it

838
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,060
and but you know honestly like you know

839
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,280
the in order to to be really convincing

840
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,839
you know I'd have to see the the

841
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,520
construction and

842
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,540
um also uh um I'm hoping to uh to that

843
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,579
we'll get there soon

844
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,640
um

845
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,440
uh the most plausible uh

846
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,900
well so so the the quantum money from

847
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,780
knots uh that I mentioned is is a

848
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,280
plausible one unfortunately like proving

849
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,619
the security of it is is uh is difficult

850
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,420
so if they're

851
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,040
um if we can have more crypto analysis

852
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,200
effort on it though that would be a good

853
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,260
thing uh and these new uh these new uh

854
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,680
constructions as well from uh from

855
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,660
from these walkable invariants also seem

856
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,920
to to be good candidates but

857
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,020
unfortunately some of them have uh have

858
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,760
missing pieces which uh which hopefully

859
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,000
will be uh will be solved in uh soon

860
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm not sure and yeah you'll have to ask

861
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,780
uh doctors

862
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,880
all right I think then we should move to

863
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,520
the last Talk of the session

864
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,880
um like quick round of thought

865
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,780
[Applause]

866
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,940
uh the last talk is going to be from

867
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,560
hardness to the of detecting

868
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,380
superpositions to cryptography and minky

869
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,700
hand is going to give the talk

870
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
um

871
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,220
hi thank you for the introduction I'm in

872
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,760
Kyan from chaos and I represent the work

873
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,099
titled by from the hardness of detecting

874
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,099
superposition to cryptographic which is

875
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,900
the based on the zooten work with Tomoka

876
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,740
okay let me summarize like the

877
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,800
contribution of the lizard in just a

878
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,599
single slide

879
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,140
first we found some new Quantum service

880
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,079
to decision deduction this is actually

881
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,960
the serial mobile physicist Scott

882
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,579
erinson

883
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,020
ETI and suskin

884
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,960
and actually there is their most

885
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,660
motivated by the something I don't know

886
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,540
quantum gravity or Quantum breaker I

887
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,339
don't know what it is but

888
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,560
we found that it is a very simple and

889
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,500
has a very interesting properties and

890
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,339
actually since it is simple and

891
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:22,140
cryptographers already use similar idea

892
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,359
in many previous works like a Quantum

893
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,560
grocery Syrian serum

894
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,540
on further application to show that this

895
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,760
reduction is really interesting for

896
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,240
example we constructed the first the

897
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,480
first con public encryption based on the

898
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,400
donabelling group action

899
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,440
which was posed by

900
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,760
TCC 2009 19 yeah and we found another

901
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,380
application to the content bit

902
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,240
commitment uh for changing the flavor of

903
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,819
a Quantum bitcoinment very efficiently

904
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:02,460
and showing that essentially two flavors

905
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,660
are essentially the same

906
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,359
lizard has some concurrent work

907
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,760
recently

908
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,140
like

909
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,040
oh I think eurocrypt is cryptographic

910
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,380
conference but I think we need to start

911
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,800
from some physical things

912
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,040
let's but I think you're all familiar

913
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,140
with Schrodinger Escape experiment

914
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,839
in the series experiment we prepare a

915
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,440
cat and prepare some Quantum atom which

916
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,800
with probably one over two it decays

917
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
then it it is not dictate with one over

918
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,900
two probability

919
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,200
and if atomist Kate we kill the cat

920
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,480
otherwise we do nothing

921
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,339
so finally we have a cat which is die or

922
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,900
not

923
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,900
so if we believe the quantum physics we

924
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,560
have for the cat which is simultaneously

925
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,420
alive and dead

926
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,300
and if we refuse to believe quantum

927
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,700
physics and we just use the classical

928
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,180
probability Theory then this kid is uh

929
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,400
live with probably one over two and that

930
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
with probably one over two and we can

931
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,619
think the sweating gasket experiment to

932
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,060
escape we can distinguishing these two

933
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,099
two situations

934
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,440
to determine we are living Quantum world

935
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,720
or not

936
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,020
and as a cryptographer we are

937
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,260
particularly interested interested in

938
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,859
if we can efficiently determine if where

939
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:42,780
are we

940
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,579
and

941
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,579
believe me this task is equivalent to

942
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,000
the distinguishing

943
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,480
these two tests two states one is the

944
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,060
online plus State and the other list are

945
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,760
like minus that

946
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,060
using some complexity arguments

947
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,859
some quantum physics

948
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,060
and

949
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,420
believe in this our primary task is to

950
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,000
distinguishing the

951
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,940
online plus online plus dead and alive

952
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,520
minus that

953
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,060
and here is

954
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,579
consume comes

955
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:25,140
they showed that this distinguishing

956
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,359
test is equivalent to computational

957
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,660
equivalent to swapping the or live

958
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,440
Cadence that cat

959
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,520
uh more formally

960
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,040
if we can distinguishing these two

961
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,380
states then we can construct the unitary

962
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,300
map view which

963
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,180
Maps or live cat to that cat and that

964
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,520
get to a live cat

965
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,780
and

966
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,460
uh yeah

967
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,940
we can say that in the overall

968
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,460
task it is observing the interference

969
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,819
between alive and dead and in the

970
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:03,119
test the Lotus it is a swapping test

971
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,319
and other scenario good that if

972
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,319
in the physical world we cannot reserve

973
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,060
the dead cat to a life

974
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,040
so

975
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,260
sorting or live can take care is

976
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,540
physically hard problem or the promise

977
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,300
you had problem and this problem is

978
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,140
equivalent to the distinguishing life

979
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,680
lost that and life minus that so

980
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,900
as I said this over problem is

981
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,819
equivalent to the distinguishing

982
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:36,300
physical world and probably the word so

983
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,440
in by using this interpretation others

984
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,780
very good at

985
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,579
observing this proposition in large

986
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,940
state is computational height because we

987
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,200
cannot Allah select that cat

988
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,140
so uh let me

989
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,540
talk about some formal statement of this

990
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,560
theorem okay we think about two also

991
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,220
going to State X and Y and PSI and Pi

992
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,880
install X Plus y and x minus y State and

993
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,200
for any positive Delta these two tests

994
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,119
is equivalent

995
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,579
the first one is the swapping and the

996
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,020
second one the second one is

997
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,660
distinguishing of X Plus y and x minus y

998
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,420
and I don't want to

999
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,800
describe the proof but proof is really

1000
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,260
simple just so using some simple

1001
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,940
circuits

1002
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,260
so

1003
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,780
why do we talk about this theorem

1004
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,760
this physical theorem

1005
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,940
because we found that this theorem can

1006
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,400
be interpreted as a Quantum search

1007
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,740
decision reduction

1008
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,119
for example

1009
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,900
let me describe more detail in the oval

1010
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,640
test it is

1011
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,940
kind of a search test to find X from Y

1012
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,839
and Y from X and if you said y to be f x

1013
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,839
for one a function f then this test is

1014
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,760
to find X from f x which is one way hard

1015
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,000
and the second task is apparently

1016
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,680
distinguishing task

1017
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,200
and this difference is that these two

1018
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,119
problem is equivalent

1019
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,380
so

1020
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,359
it can be seen as our search to decision

1021
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,779
reduction

1022
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,319
yeah

1023
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,900
and we know that 30 decision reduction

1024
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,960
is very important in cryptography and

1025
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,839
computer science for example

1026
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,700
for the satisfiability problem we

1027
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,060
usually Define it as a decision problem

1028
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,520
but we usually want to find the solution

1029
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,920
of a satisfiability and in cryptography

1030
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,140
we usually assume the minimal assumption

1031
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,500
like only function but we at some point

1032
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,260
want to prove some decision or hard

1033
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,160
problem

1034
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,040
so we need at some point to search the

1035
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,380
decision reduction

1036
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,480
so

1037
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,780
I think it is our main message their

1038
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,780
theorem is a new Quantum search to

1039
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,400
decision reduction

1040
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,720
and

1041
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,480
as I said we found that this idea is

1042
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,780
already used in many cryptographic works

1043
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,819
like Quantum grocery code Rich living

1044
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:23,760
theorem and some list and work on

1045
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,460
collecting and some our follow-up works

1046
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,720
like uh

1047
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,819
public encryption from one a function

1048
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:31,440
Quantum public encryption from only

1049
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,119
function

1050
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,980
and we found some new applications like

1051
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,339
as I said

1052
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,000
I think I have to worry

1053
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,980
so we need to talk about cryptographic

1054
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,380
application the first one is the public

1055
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,540
encryption from Nona billion group

1056
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,240
action and the second one is efficient

1057
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,920
playable conversion of a Quantum bit

1058
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,180
commitment

1059
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,819
and now we need we are going to

1060
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:03,780
cryptography but we need to code some

1061
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,040
details

1062
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,640
okay

1063
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,099
group action is defined for Group C and

1064
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,960
SLS

1065
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,619
and satisfy these two conditions

1066
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,680
for the identity element in group it

1067
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,160
Maps the set element to the it accessor

1068
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,359
identity map and it's satisfied CHX to

1069
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,339
is equal to ghs

1070
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,980
and we say that correction is one way if

1071
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,400
it is hard to find given sngs it

1072
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,940
affected by G and we say the correction

1073
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,420
is children them if sngs is

1074
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,520
computationally indistinguishable from

1075
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,079
ascenti

1076
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,040
for random t

1077
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,000
and

1078
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,140
if we assume available

1079
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,839
then you can simply construct the TV

1080
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:04,559
master key exchange easily but recently

1081
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,040
in thesis in 19 researchers suggested

1082
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,800
the non-avilion correction as a new

1083
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,839
cryptographic primitive and they

1084
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:16,740
constructed some mini primitive but they

1085
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,079
cannot disable

1086
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,599
public encryption and it lives as an

1087
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,920
open problem

1088
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,540
and we did it

1089
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,079
with Quantum type text

1090
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,319
as the construction is simple we talk

1091
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:34,200
about it detail

1092
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,220
the main idea is this just using the

1093
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,980
around skin serum

1094
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,420
directly and incomp bit in phase

1095
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,180
or precisely

1096
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,359
our ciphertext is of the following form

1097
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,319
for a set element testing group element

1098
00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:00,300
G we construct some ciphertext or B to

1099
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,180
be something like that encode the bit in

1100
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,680
the face

1101
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,240
then

1102
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,700
if if we constructed this type of text

1103
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,280
then another testoster skin serum says

1104
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,059
that

1105
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:14,160
distinguishing these two Quantum state

1106
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,859
is equivalent to

1107
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:21,259
mapping sdgs which

1108
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,559
probably says that we know G which break

1109
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,740
the wondering instead of a group action

1110
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,859
so it is a basic idea but there are many

1111
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:34,020
problems for example

1112
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,599
it is hard to construct from what is

1113
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:39,059
what is tricky and what is publicly and

1114
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,280
it is hard to construct and

1115
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,859
it is hard to disting this thing I don't

1116
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:47,058
know never mind

1117
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,420
so we come up with some other complex

1118
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,160
construction but

1119
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,260
it turns out that

1120
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,640
it is easy to construct from Secret Key

1121
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,920
and public key sngs

1122
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,480
and we show that if our underlying

1123
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,940
revection is should random then it is in

1124
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,260
this in CPA secure

1125
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,920
okay

1126
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,420
to move before move to the commitment I

1127
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,640
need to talk something more about the

1128
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,040
equivalent theorem

1129
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,460
as shown in this simple proof

1130
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,819
we can observe this

1131
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:35,579
equivalent theorem preserved have some

1132
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,440
interesting property like a locally

1133
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,220
preserving which means that if the map a

1134
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,740
do not EX on some qubits then your

1135
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,859
certain ad the same qubits and vice

1136
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,960
versa horse

1137
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,720
and we show that it or this different

1138
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,260
even if we have advice

1139
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,660
okay then let me talk about bit

1140
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,280
commitment

1141
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,240
in the Bitcoin Montero 2 participate one

1142
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,359
is sender and the other is receiver

1143
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:09,900
or sender wants to send wants to commit

1144
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,040
he decides a bit B

1145
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,040
and using the commitment

1146
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,700
oh yeah in the first place he in the

1147
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,980
simplest case in the first page it

1148
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,400
commit the ascending or commitment

1149
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,380
and later it sent the opening to

1150
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,160
convince that he should speak

1151
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,940
in in the as we have two party two

1152
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,500
Define Secret

1153
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,000
oh

1154
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,180
oh it's the T-shirt okay it has a two

1155
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,640
security notion one is hiding and one is

1156
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,940
binding hi hiding says that

1157
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,800
sender cannot change his mind after

1158
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,119
commitment

1159
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,200
and receiver cannot find a bit before

1160
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,180
opening

1161
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,540
and we essentially wanted they are

1162
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,960
statistically hurt but

1163
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,000
it is shown that poster status quality

1164
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,940
is impossible even in the quantum word

1165
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,819
so in cryptography we use usually relax

1166
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:17,040
one of them like a

1167
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,220
Terror so there are two commitment one

1168
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,720
is a statistical hiding and

1169
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,880
computational binding and the other is

1170
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,260
the computational binding and

1171
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,059
statistical hiding

1172
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,839
and in the quantum word

1173
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:32,819
okay

1174
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:35,779
in the continent

1175
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,920
it turns out that Quantum communication

1176
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,400
is very helpful for commitment scheme

1177
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,960
it is shown that there are simpler

1178
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,300
Construction in for Content commitment

1179
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,920
and

1180
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,500
it is shown that Quantum commitment is

1181
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,319
inherently non-interactive

1182
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,780
and it can be

1183
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,040
described as a simple protocol like a

1184
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,440
sender prepare resource store

1185
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,000
two register Quantum State and then the

1186
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,760
send register c as a commitment and send

1187
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,480
register r as an opening

1188
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,380
and recently Jan shows that terrorists

1189
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,319
are efficient conversion of a flavor or

1190
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,660
In classical studying it is technically

1191
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,599
passive report very complex

1192
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,579
to change the statistical hiding to

1193
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,859
compute statistical hiding computational

1194
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,960
buying two statistical binding

1195
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,960
computational hiding but in the quantum

1196
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,059
setting the conversion is much simpler

1197
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,700
like has a multiplication overhead

1198
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,640
Lambda square and we show that it is

1199
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,520
essentially equivalent to Tesla calling

1200
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,680
on a single

1201
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,420
statistical hiding computation and

1202
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,740
finding commitment

1203
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,540
can make a status combining

1204
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,359
computational hiding commitment

1205
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:57,440
yeah the idea is

1206
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,819
simply but

1207
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:02,400
ideal and purpose profile is actually

1208
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,520
simple but just

1209
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,900
keep it

1210
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,280
okay our component is like that if we

1211
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,300
commit if our base commitment is commit

1212
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,319
and

1213
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,700
I'm sorry

1214
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,640
if our phase commitment construct the 50

1215
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,040
and Phi 1 is the commitment of zero and

1216
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,920
one then new commitment scheme is sort

1217
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,260
of like that and changing the just the

1218
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,940
rural for CNR it works as a changing the

1219
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,900
hiding and painting

1220
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,099
yeah and it has a concurrent work

1221
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:41,520
recently so

1222
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,859
let me wrap up my talk with conclusion

1223
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,200
we found the new Quantum search to

1224
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,119
decision reduction based on the

1225
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:51,180
physicist serum

1226
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,900
and we saw that it is really it has a

1227
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,540
really many applications like

1228
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,200
one from pke Context and the other is

1229
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,660
the in the commitment context

1230
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,799
thank you for listening

1231
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:12,839
[Applause]

1232
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:16,759
so do we have any questions

1233
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,440
no questions yeah

1234
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,559
thank you

1235
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,869
[Applause]
