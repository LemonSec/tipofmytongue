1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
probably sharing the session thanks for

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,720
coming to the session we have a switch

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,940
in the first two talks of decision the

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,480
order is changed but everything is in

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,940
place thank you for the speaker for the

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,099
last minute accommodation so the talk is

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,079
going to be about secure sampling with

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,740
sublinear communication by stronger Choi

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,260
Donald

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,100
Gordon linchang Liu and Arcadia

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,480
hirokumovich and Link shank is going to

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,560
give you something

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,679
all right thank you all for coming

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,440
So speaking of secure a secure sampling

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,960
let's consider a study of a two-party

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,860
computation

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,140
so suppose we have two parties and they

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,879
want to sample some information from

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,559
some joint distributions

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,899
this actually comes up a lot in

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,940
particular differential privacy has been

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,800
started a lot where we often sample from

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,320
calcium or LaPlace and distributions and

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,579
there are also other settings that we

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,960
also want to sample from private

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,039
distributions

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,739
so there are prior Works done on this

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,559
public functions so what if the

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,120
probability itself that you want to

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,780
sample from is uh shared distributedly

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,700
across two parties

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,880
so assume each of the party has a vector

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,920
of weights and the probability function

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,780
you want to sample from is jointly

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,840
defined on these two weights as so uh

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
for example if the function is a l y

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
distance between the two Vector that

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,799
defines the L1 L1 distribution then that

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,780
depends defines the algorithm Point

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,880
problem and similarly we could have L2

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,220
and production for it and more and more

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,619
so the question is how can we sample

43
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,939
from this privately

44
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,740
well a simple answer would be the

45
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,960
following we let it let one of the party

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,540
homologically encrypt his Vector sent

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,340
over to the other then we can

48
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,380
homophobically sample from it

49
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,659
this is good this is easy and it works

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,939
well however it requires linear

51
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,079
communication

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,880
so they really really simple question

53
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,579
which we're asking our paper can we do

54
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,939
this with sublinear communication

55
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,399
so while we're discussion in our mind we

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,860
started a several distributions that are

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,719
common Solutions so we construct custom

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,459
linear protocol for l y and L2

59
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,538
distribution

60
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,060
however for product distribution we show

61
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,400
that it is impossible in general unless

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,959
you make some assumptions on those

63
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,900
inputs and from those products sampling

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
protocol we construct a two-party

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
exponential mechanism as well

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,319
so let's see some construct some real uh

67
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,500
protocols starting from L1

68
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,480
so remember that it's still the

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
two-party setting and now the

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
probability that the two party wants to

71
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,300
sample from is this L1 distribution

72
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,099
defined below

73
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,500
so how do we solve this let's take a

74
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,360
look at this probability function

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,879
this is basically like so given L1 is

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
linear this is basically like uh the the

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,860
summation between the inputs from two

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,019
parties and we see that each party can

79
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,120
compute exactly one of them

80
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,280
so while this gives out a very simple

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,300
solution

82
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,040
why not we just let the party one

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,500
looking at his own input example one of

84
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,840
the index I want based on his own local

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
input and probably two example of I2

86
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,519
based on his local input then all we

87
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,019
need to do is just to choose one of the

88
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,760
by some coin flip

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
so this one gives is corresponding

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,959
exactly corresponding to adding those

91
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,580
two probability together

92
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,680
and the only communication is happening

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,659
in the third step which we need to flip

94
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,580
a bias coin to decide which one to

95
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,480
Output

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
and that gives us correct answer with

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,640
constant communication however this is

98
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,220
not private the part is kind of learned

99
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,080
whether the final output matches his

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
coin toss or not

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
so we need to fix this

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,780
instead of let the let the party one

103
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,060
samples I want you to clear we let the

104
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,980
post party around a protocol

105
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,560
that our leadership samples this i1 for

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,780
party one and secret share it

107
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,340
similarly we can do the same thing for

108
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,620
part two and this oblivious sample

109
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,540
sample protocol is constructed with

110
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,819
security party computation and Apache

111
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,980
and this can be done in constant

112
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,459
communication

113
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,959
this time with three point inside the

114
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,299
fpg and decide which one to reconstruct

115
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,659
and operate to both parties so now rd1

116
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,060
no longer knows the Iowa rd2 no longer

117
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,400
knows I2 so with achieving the same

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,738
constant communication size but this

119
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,380
time this is secure this is private

120
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,399
great

121
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
so now we know how to do all right

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,900
sampling which is a very easy case now

123
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,940
let's have a look at another case L2

124
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,139
sampling

125
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,259
so exactly the same setting except for

126
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,360
now we are going to sample from this L2

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
distribution defined below

128
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,000
so a question will be like by looking at

129
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,560
this probability function of L2

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,699
distribution

131
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,100
we ask can we apply the tree the same

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,380
trick from L1 maybe we just do the same

133
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,759
trick like both parties stand for

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,860
something and open something

135
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,919
however remember all we can do for the

136
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,380
L1 is because the l y is linear but

137
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,540
looking at this cost terms this is

138
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,340
apparently not linear

139
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,259
and especially for those customs in the

140
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,240
denominator they are actually the inner

141
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,580
product between those two vectors and

142
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,380
this is how to compute we don't know how

143
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,180
to compute that sublinearly

144
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,120
so apparently what do we have for L1

145
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,220
cannot be working cannot be working for

146
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,220
L2 we need something new

147
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,380
well this is our new trick we call that

148
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,660
corrective standpoint and the whole idea

149
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,120
is that instead of directly sample from

150
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,060
this L2 distribution we pick a related

151
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,220
distribution which should be easy to

152
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,360
sample with

153
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,039
and I will get the index from that

154
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,139
distribution and then we need to correct

155
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,620
it back to our desired distribution by a

156
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,440
step called rejection sampling so the uh

157
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,080
the whole point is that if somehow this

158
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,120
distribution this distribution is

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,460
correlated with the distribution will be

160
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,800
desired the desired distribution then we

161
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,060
should be able to get the correct answer

162
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,039
correct output

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,780
and for the related distribution

164
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,880
especially for L2 case

165
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,620
what we want to do is to drop those cost

166
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,820
terms

167
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,160
so then we can avoid the Computing of

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,419
the inner product

169
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,919
that's what we want

170
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,160
for this probability Pi we need to

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,919
correct the index I from the previous

172
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,860
distribution that should be only be

173
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,960
dependent on the ice input which makes

174
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,300
this step easy to compute otherwise we

175
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,100
are doing nothing meaningless

176
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,100
so now with this intuition in your mind

177
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,380
let's see our actual protocol

178
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,539
so remember this is a distribution I

179
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,940
call that a related distribution which

180
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,580
is a distribution a unit from now and

181
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,800
this is exactly the distribution of L2

182
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,380
dropping all those cross terms of course

183
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,720
it's easy to stand program that's using

184
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,940
our L1 protocol you see each part is

185
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,160
just locally compute those inputs by

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
square their terms and this can be done

187
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,699
constantly

188
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,819
and then somehow if we can correct it

189
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,039
back with this probability DPI that is

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,080
the ratio between the L2 distribution

191
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,240
which is what we want and this

192
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,460
distribution a now we should be good to

193
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,180
go

194
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,940
so how do I compute this Pi it seems

195
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,720
hard

196
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,419
intuitively it sounds like it seems like

197
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,819
it should be as hard as just simple from

198
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,039
L2 directly because I'm basically doing

199
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,180
nothing

200
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,759
so let's see can we really handle that

201
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,819
so the pi remember the pi we want should

202
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,139
be the ratio between these two

203
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,220
distribution

204
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,319
and we written the terms right ending

205
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,880
with these two terms

206
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,340
looking at the left term this only

207
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,860
depends on the if input Computing of

208
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,440
this part is easy that's just a constant

209
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
number of summation and constant number

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,400
of multiplication you can run some

211
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,500
secure computation protocol and get that

212
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,560
part so how about this writer this is

213
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,599
how to compute and we don't know how to

214
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,740
compute that

215
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,160
however like in terms of I from the

216
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,620
distribution a this is constant

217
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,300
so why don't we why do I need to compute

218
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,160
that we don't have to so even though we

219
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
don't know how to compute it it doesn't

220
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,759
change our output we still get the

221
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,919
correct distribution of L2

222
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,860
so we can just use that part as our PI

223
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,840
well of course you need to adjust that

224
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,759
by some constant number to make it a

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,560
valid probability

226
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,259
so then intuitively we have a particle

227
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,360
for L2 and it's simple from this

228
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,759
distribution a as I mentioned before by

229
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,860
our L1 protocol is constant

230
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,800
communication and with this Pi we can

231
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,599
run this so if you can see this is the

232
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,319
sunshine here with this Pi we expect

233
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,120
this protocol to run our expected

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
constant number of runs so overall we

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,379
will have a constant communication

236
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,360
protocol for L2 sampling

237
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,580
and this idea can be easily extended to

238
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,700
any LP so for any P that's larger than

239
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,599
two it works this the similar way

240
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,600
so now we have a sense of L2 as well how

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,940
about product sampling so we should have

242
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,920
a talk ahead of me we will give a

243
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,180
definition about production the

244
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,100
distribution and now let me give that

245
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,440
first this is exactly the same setting

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
and we but this time we want to sample

247
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,980
from this distribution we call the

248
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,899
product distribution

249
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,420
so how do we stumble from that again

250
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,060
let's see the probability function

251
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,580
so we see that the probability it for

252
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,800
some index I being sampled that is

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,140
exactly the multiplication between this

254
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,580
two terms

255
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,860
this is exactly like the similar thing

256
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,620
we saw before that one party can compute

257
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,459
exactly locally have one of that somehow

258
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,820
it gives us an idea similar to L1 so

259
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,500
maybe we let the party one

260
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,380
so we use our oblivious uh protocol as

261
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,959
well but the post party to sample for L1

262
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,140
and then secret share i1 and repeat for

263
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,980
I2 so this time we are going to do a

264
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,120
equality check if i y equals to I2 good

265
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,100
we operated

266
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,860
otherwise we restart this process and

267
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,660
this is exactly corresponding to

268
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,540
multiply these two probability together

269
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,580
that sounds like a solution

270
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,640
however this this protocol has the

271
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,920
expected number of iteration that is one

272
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,660
over the inner product

273
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,060
so that gives us a sense that if you

274
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,880
want a sublinear communication you need

275
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
to have something some assumption on the

276
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
inner product yeah so we need

277
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
sufficiently large in the product to

278
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
make this particle sublinear

279
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,680
communication

280
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,380
and also since you have assumptions on

281
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,899
the input inherently this protocol will

282
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,640
have some leakage that is the inner

283
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,800
product as well so we can simulate that

284
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,480
from the inner product

285
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,760
so now there is another question in

286
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,620
general can we get rid of this

287
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,720
assumption can we do sublinear product

288
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,820
sampling in general

289
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,279
maybe some new trick well apparently

290
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,860
this time it's impossible we find it's

291
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,380
impossible to do that with a visual

292
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,000
reduction from set destroying this

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,399
problem which is uh which can be shown

294
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,320
that it requires at least a linear

295
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
communication to solve it

296
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,079
so this is for product sampling from the

297
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,360
product sampling so we'll see that when

298
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,339
it's possible to construct that and in

299
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,860
general it's impossible then we realize

300
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,800
a two-party exponential mechanism

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,420
the whole point for exponential

302
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,339
mechanism is to achieve differential

303
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,720
privacy

304
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,420
so assuming you have a list of items h

305
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,579
and the the goal for exponential

306
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,560
mechanism is to Output some of the hi

307
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,380
with the probability proportion to the e

308
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,200
to the power of sh here s is a score

309
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,839
function evaluate on H and the purpose

310
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,000
is to hide the individual privacy for

311
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,399
the individual item age

312
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,120
so now for two-party settings uh assume

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,880
that uh a additive score function that

314
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,220
is collectively a distributed among two

315
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,820
parties so in a word that each party can

316
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,360
compute a portion of this score function

317
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,579
and so let's say the party J can compute

318
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,579
the SJ of h i and the goal is now to

319
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,579
Output a common hi with a probability

320
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,120
that is e to the power of the total s

321
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,680
and that is equal to the e to the power

322
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,959
as one times e to the power S2 that's

323
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,980
given by mathematics so now did you say

324
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,399
something this part is exactly two terms

325
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,920
they are multiplied together one term

326
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,140
can be computed by one of the party

327
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,260
this is our product sampling right so

328
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,940
basically just plug our product summary

329
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,980
particle here you should be able to get

330
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,920
the exactly same sublinear exponential

331
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,899
mechanism for two parties

332
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,480
but don't forget that our protocol when

333
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,220
it when it works when you give your

334
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,620
sublinear communication it comes with

335
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,839
the leakage that is up to the inner

336
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,920
product

337
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,019
so our solution would be using a

338
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,260
differential private version of JL

339
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,300
transform to estimate the inner product

340
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,820
to fix this leakage so now we can

341
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,800
achieve a fully differential private

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
exponential mechanism in a two-party

343
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,720
setting and it comes with uh sublinear

344
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,579
communication

345
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,980
so that's basically all I want to split

346
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,040
today and uh So eventually we brought a

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,339
question about uh a secure sampling uh

348
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,779
security party sampling with something

349
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,660
communication and with with construction

350
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,240
we construct the models for L1 L2 and

351
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,940
extend to LP distribution and we show

352
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,279
that when it's possible it's impossible

353
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,160
for a product sampling and we also

354
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,360
realized that two-part exponential

355
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,339
mechanism for differential privacy and

356
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,260
that's all I have for today thank you

357
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,120
so we have time for a couple of

358
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,420
questions

359
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,160
so I have one so what if we have uh

360
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,279
distributions that are huge uh in terms

361
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,779
of the number of points but we have like

362
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,459
parameters for them like suppose you

363
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,320
have parameters of a gaussian

364
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,120
distribution somehow shared between the

365
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,220
two parties if they want to sample from

366
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,399
it and does your Technique help us how

367
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,160
to do it or is it the easier question by

368
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,560
any chance I think it depends it's more

369
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,959
like a different question like so for

370
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,880
this type of question it's more like the

371
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,519
probability to sample some points has a

372
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,920
sort of fixed probability but

373
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,959
distributed amount of party it's not

374
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,300
like a specific of a specific version of

375
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
distribution like calcium or LaPlace

376
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,860
actually the Opera Works down on this

377
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,660
type of question but very few work

378
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,880
activated and find any on this type of

379
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,040
work even though we only like focus on

380
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
like L1 L2 LP distribution as defined on

381
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,079
those two inputs well of course you can

382
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,000
generalize it to any different function

383
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,180
so for example as you ask if you have a

384
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,820
large gaussian distribution

385
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,480
and those inputs are just like those

386
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,980
parameters are just the inputs from post

387
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,019
to party that should be the same problem

388
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,079
but that would be a huge like much

389
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,779
harder than the one I showed today so

390
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,120
basically if you can somehow find a way

391
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,519
for example some there are a bunch of

392
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,000
distributions that you can like apply

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
our technique of the get around like a

394
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,820
corrective uh sampling magnet technique

395
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,220
then maybe you could do that but other

396
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,480
than that there are tons of

397
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,959
distributions you cannot do sublinearly

398
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,079
okay

399
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,060
what happens if you're willing to

400
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,339
um compromise and get a distribution

401
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,940
that sort of close to the L1 or 2

402
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,620
product anything like that but not

403
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,040
exactly

404
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,980
so uh uh I'm sorry the output

405
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,560
distribution you want it to be within

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
some statistical distance of your target

407
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,040
distribution but it doesn't have to be

408
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,920
exactly the same well in our like in

409
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,019
this model we are more focusing on the

410
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,699
distribution that is exactly that

411
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,639
distribution so so if your customer is

412
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,800
asking about whether we can do the

413
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,019
distribution that is closer enough to

414
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,399
distribution

415
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,279
so I guess the answer should be yes

416
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,380
because that's more like the you're

417
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,699
still changing the function app so

418
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,680
remember our distribution is defined by

419
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,620
the function of those two vectors so

420
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,360
think about this similar case I just

421
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,000
randomly wipe away some of those inputs

422
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,980
that give us a roughly closer enough

423
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,860
distribution so if that match your

424
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,480
definition about close enough that

425
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,760
should work but whether that can achieve

426
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,740
sublinear it still depends on Case by

427
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,920
case

428
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,300
what is your rejection probability when

429
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,660
you do the effects uh that's a so for

430
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,339
rejection probability that should be y

431
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,680
minus the pi I mentioned so the pi would

432
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
be the probability that you accepted

433
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,940
that index you sample from the helper

434
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,380
distribution

435
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,440
thank you very much is there a reason to

436
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,820
believe that this is the best possible

437
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,860
uh

438
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,000
for L2 so there is isn't there is no

439
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,279
test so basically that gives us constant

440
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,079
expected a constant number of runs so

441
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,820
that would be fine well you could always

442
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,579
adjust it by some constant like divided

443
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,800
by 2 divided by three depends on your

444
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,380
need so that doesn't matter however like

445
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,300
for the product sampling even though I

446
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,040
didn't call that rejection sample you

447
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,299
still need to run that

448
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,000
many many iterations and the expected

449
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,319
number of iteration as I mentioned

450
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,599
that's one over the inner product so

451
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,000
basically you could

452
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,160
today that you need to trade off between

453
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,359
the

454
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,640
the probability for rejection

455
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,079
like

456
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,059
to get better

457
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,500
communication

458
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,919
and that's inherently that implies to

459
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,600
have strong requirements for the inner

460
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,460
product or something like that thank you

461
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,140
very much so we need to move to the next

462
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,480
talk I mean which was thank you very

463
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,860
much less thanks to Twitter again

464
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,620
thank you very much so as I told you the

465
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,059
order of the first two talks are

466
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,780
switched so we're gonna have Nathan now

467
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,200
Nathan dear

468
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,299
so while the speaker is setting up let

469
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,940
me tell you that Nathan's paper

470
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,940
is awarded the best young researcher

471
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,020
award and

472
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,960
and let's give it a give it up for the

473
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,700
speaker is is everything okay

474
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,660
let's wait till

475
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,620
electricity

476
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,120
don't press the last button okay you can

477
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,620
also use the arrow keys okay so as I

478
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,179
said this is the best young researchers

479
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,340
award let's uh give it up for him

480
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,380
yeah type computational and

481
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,940
distinguishability balance for product

482
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,280
distribution by Nathan uh yeah please

483
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,020
thank you very much for the introduction

484
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
um so the general theme of today's talk

485
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,760
will be about generalizing statistical

486
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,220
bounds to the computational setting

487
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,220
so a famous example in this setting just

488
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,380
to give you a general idea of what we

489
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,220
are going to do is just so Lema

490
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,620
so here uh what we have statistically is

491
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,880
that if we have two distributions d0 and

492
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,299
V and D1 such that we're going to draw a

493
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,580
random bit B and then draw from DB and

494
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,980
give it to an adversary asking him to

495
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,860
correlate the sample to back to B

496
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,039
its ability to do this is bounded by

497
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,299
Delta

498
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,480
so if I have this then once I repeat it

499
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,760
4K times once I give him K independent

500
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
samples and ask him to correlate it back

501
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,660
to the store of the bits

502
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,419
his ability to do this is at most will

503
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,020
decrease exponentially by K2 Delta decay

504
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,140
so this holds statistically and it's not

505
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,660
very hard to show using uh the

506
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,640
definition of statistical distance but

507
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,280
computationally it's more involved

508
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,200
because we actually need the

509
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,179
constructive proof this proof this proof

510
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,380
using statistical distance is not

511
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,539
constructing and computationally we

512
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,880
actually need to talk and to show how we

513
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,120
take an adversary against the Cake store

514
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,780
and transform it into efficiently into

515
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,600
an adversary against one instance

516
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
now another comment that I want to make

517
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,799
here is that

518
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,880
usually we expect to have some slackness

519
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,280
here some computational errors so

520
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,799
we may not be able to construct exactly

521
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,559
a Delta an adversary with Delta

522
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,020
correlation instead we may only be able

523
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,240
to add a construct an adversary with a

524
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,280
Delta minus Epsilon correlation

525
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,980
and we can make this Epsilon as small as

526
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,620
we want by paying with the running time

527
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,260
so we in general we also carrying these

528
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,840
types of of reductions about the trade

529
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,160
of we may care about the trade-off

530
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,799
between slackness and running time we

531
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,799
will get to it also later

532
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,340
okay now this was your solemma what is

533
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,780
the bound that we are going to

534
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,919
generalize

535
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,620
so uh it's the direct protocol bound

536
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,960
let's say that I have two pairs of

537
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,919
distributions X1 and x0 with distance DX

538
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,820
and y1 and Y 0 with distance d y

539
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,299
now what we're going to consider is the

540
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:28,740
distance between x 0 y 0 that is uh two

541
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,720
independent samples from X zero and Y

542
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,880
zero against two independent samples

543
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,419
from X1 and y1 okay so we draw a bit and

544
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,940
either we give the adversary to samples

545
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,960
from X 0 y 0 or X1 y1 now it is not hard

546
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
to show in fact it's it's very

547
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,260
fundamental using a simple hybrid

548
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,159
argument

549
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,520
that the distance will be at most DX

550
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,659
plus d y

551
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,240
however it turns out that statistically

552
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,860
it is full of crore knowledge in

553
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,500
probability theory that you can show

554
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,299
that this bond is not typed and you can

555
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,000
actually show something tighter which is

556
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,840
tight

557
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,140
the bound that is DX plus d y minus DX

558
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,000
times d y

559
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,980
okay so this is the type Bound for two

560
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,919
products if you try to uh use it again

561
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,240
and again in order to get the Bound for

562
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,159
a k product what you get is that if the

563
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,280
distance between X and Y is d then you

564
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,539
get at the distance between the K

565
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,000
products is one minus one minus D to the

566
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,780
k

567
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,000
which is Diet instead of D times K which

568
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,340
can be even larger than one

569
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,960
okay

570
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
so what we are going to show is the new

571
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,900
uh direct and uh simple proof of this

572
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,520
type bound with a very good parameter

573
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,080
with very good parameters that is very

574
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,960
good trade-off between uh the slackness

575
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,120
and running time in in the case of uh

576
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,760
non-uniform in the non-uniform setting

577
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,440
we also generalized in the uniform

578
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,720
setting but with was parameters

579
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,260
so before we get to that uh why is this

580
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,299
bound important I mean when do we care

581
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,640
about it so for example if it is

582
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,220
negligible in case polynomial then

583
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,320
there's not that much of a difference

584
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,299
between them so we may not really care

585
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,320
about this

586
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,860
so really the case where we make where

587
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,600
the difference may be more important is

588
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,360
when did times K is large

589
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,299
and just to demonstrate to you uh such a

590
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,340
such a case I will shortly talk about

591
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,260
amplification of weak oblivious transfer

592
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,120
before that I just want to emphasize

593
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,360
that we all already know how to amplify

594
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,220
awake of the protocols computationally

595
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,799
but I'm just going to present it so you

596
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,960
can get a sense of what types of

597
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,159
settings these bound is used

598
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,500
so we completely transfer amplification

599
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,080
originally proved statistically by uh

600
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,020
the Killian and salvale and then

601
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,159
um generalized to the computational

602
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,740
setting by Wars Lego

603
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
um works as follows so we have and we'll

604
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
call T the Central Security and civil

605
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,360
security are maybe constant instead of

606
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,919
negligible and we want to amplify them

607
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,260
both to negligible the way this works is

608
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,539
using an interchanging application of

609
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,520
two operations we have one operation

610
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,559
that amplifies sender security

611
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,780
adjustment at the expense of civil

612
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,640
security and another operation that

613
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,140
amplifies receiver security at the

614
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,240
expense of sender security Now the point

615
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,820
is that in each of this operation the

616
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,380
sore the applicant the amplification

617
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,600
behaves like xor and the degradation

618
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
behaves like a direct product

619
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,280
okay why is that so let's let's look at

620
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,340
for example the operation that amplifies

621
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,159
the center security so what we do here

622
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,679
is secret share the the database of the

623
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,620
sender into into K instances so its

624
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,039
Security will be Amplified like xor

625
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,720
meanwhile the receiver's Choice bit will

626
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
be constant throughout the Decay

627
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,640
instances so the security degrades like

628
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,260
a direct product because we use the same

629
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,600
bits in all the instances

630
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
so here uh it's important to actually

631
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
use the tight bound because otherwise

632
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,740
you will not be able to get to amplify

633
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,539
the full range of parameters otherwise

634
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,179
there will be some non-trivial OT

635
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,100
protocols we go to protocols that you

636
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,120
will not be able to amplify to

637
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,980
full-fledgedy

638
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,679
okay

639
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,200
before we get to the actual adversary I

640
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
want I need to mention a few related

641
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,380
walks so first of all uh molar and

642
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,179
sorrow show how to get a computational

643
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:33,000
generalization of the coupling technique

644
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
in uh and you do this using

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,500
hollenstein's tight version of the

646
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,380
hardcore Lemma so once you have this you

647
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,799
have a general a general tool of uh

648
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,100
a moving statistical proofs using

649
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,440
coupling to the computational setting so

650
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,120
you can also apply it here because we

651
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,460
can improve this the boundary Dimension

652
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,039
using coupling and so you can do this

653
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,100
and it works and this is also uh what

654
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,620
the volts like you're used but this

655
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
advantage of this is that this is the

656
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,320
adversary is somewhat more involved and

657
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,200
you get worse parameters worse trade-off

658
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,799
between the slackness and the overhead

659
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,159
also uh and I will talk about parameters

660
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,559
in a moment also there is a paper by 11

661
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,140
Robin that works specifically on this

662
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,400
bound however their focus was uh mostly

663
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,220
on on allowing it to work when there is

664
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
interaction on allowing for interaction

665
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,220
and not on improving the parameters

666
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,900
so about the parameters

667
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,539
so for some parameters for example if

668
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,240
the distance between the K products is

669
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,600
expected to be upper bounded by constant

670
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,640
then what's going to happen here is that

671
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,539
instead of increasing the circuit size

672
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:56,400
by one over Epsilon Square the verb

673
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,140
Epsilon is the slackness

674
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,940
we will only increase the circuit size

675
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,340
by log of net

676
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,039
so this is I think something interesting

677
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,980
here that's often in this in this

678
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,240
setting I mean

679
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,020
the the heart problem Etc

680
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,860
usually uh the overhead is polynomial in

681
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,480
one over Epsilon where Epsilon is the

682
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,820
slackness but here we get something kind

683
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,820
of unique we force for a large range of

684
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,520
parameters we can get exponentially

685
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,340
small slackness with only polynomial

686
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,539
overhead

687
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,220
so this is something a bit unique that

688
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,440
happens here

689
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,080
okay so I talked about Simplicity and

690
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,360
efficiency now let me try to demonstrate

691
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,559
it and look at the actual adversary

692
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,380
so the way it works is like is is like

693
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,400
this just a reminder what we get is a

694
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,880
distinguisher c between x0 y0 and X1 y1

695
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,159
and we want to construct either a

696
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,440
distinguisher between x 0 x 1 or y0 y1

697
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,039
so the first case the simple case is if

698
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,559
we are able to hard code some value of x

699
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,059
this is right now the number from

700
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,760
setting if you are able to hotgode some

701
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,799
value of x into C and get a good

702
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,260
distinguisher between y0 and y1 well

703
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,100
done

704
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,140
this is a simple case now the more

705
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,419
interesting case is what happens if this

706
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,820
hard coding doesn't work

707
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,179
so in fact what you what we can show is

708
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,860
that if the hard coding doesn't work

709
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,059
then the following is a good adversary

710
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,120
as a DX distinguisher between x0 and X1

711
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,159
so how does it work we want to

712
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,960
distinguish between x0 and X1 we get

713
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
this input a value X we want to know

714
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,020
where it came from

715
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,179
what's going to happen is that we start

716
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,760
from an initial guess B okay could be

717
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,460
zero could be one anything or anything

718
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,559
and then we keep repeating the following

719
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,460
we take B and we sample for YB

720
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,919
then we use this sample together with X

721
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,279
and then put it and fill it into C

722
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,679
C gives us the next guess and then we

723
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,320
continue to repeat it okay if you think

724
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,940
about it you can also describe it using

725
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,919
the following Markov chain

726
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,039
now this adversary well it's unbounded

727
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,419
right you can't actually run it so you

728
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,659
have to stop after T times so what we

729
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,520
actually want to get is the stationary

730
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,600
distribution

731
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,120
what we get in reality is just the

732
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,179
distribution after these steps

733
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,580
so if you want it 40 steps you will not

734
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,020
be able to reach the stationary

735
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,120
distribution but you will get very close

736
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,679
to it and of course you will need to pay

737
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,539
for this distance with this likeness

738
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,460
this is where the slackness comes in the

739
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,960
more time you put in the marker chain

740
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,520
the closer you get to stationary

741
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
distribution and then the less likeness

742
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,279
you need to add

743
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,760
okay

744
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,720
so this is really the adversary I think

745
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,480
it's it's pretty simple

746
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,860
and the reason and let me just try to

747
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,260
uh quickly describe the main idea

748
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,240
I'm not sure how much time we have left

749
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,539
okay

750
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,580
so I'll try to go over this quickly I

751
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,340
won't be able to go into details

752
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,720
but the idea of the proof is that we can

753
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,460
actually use C to build the

754
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,460
distinguisher for this to build the iron

755
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,320
amplifier for distinguishers between x0

756
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,460
and X1

757
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,200
so let's say that a is such a

758
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,419
distinguisher and a is not good enough

759
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,419
the advantage is less than digs

760
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,740
so if you take this distinguisher and

761
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,840
put you get next you build a new

762
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,760
distinguisher you get an X you apply a

763
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,820
you get the guess B of A now you take

764
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,279
this V and you use it to sample from YB

765
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,340
and feed it into C together with x

766
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,919
so what you can show is that after this

767
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,120
step

768
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,720
the difference between DX at the end the

769
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,240
current advantage of a will be

770
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,279
multiplied by d y

771
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,100
okay so we want to get the X we get

772
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,539
something with Advantage it is smaller

773
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,880
than x and what we can show is the

774
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,980
difference is multiplied by d y which is

775
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,299
smaller than one

776
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,919
so you do this again and again and again

777
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,299
and the difference keeps getting

778
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,240
multiplied by d y and this way you get

779
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,279
very very close to the x

780
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,700
okay this will be so the the the uh the

781
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,020
approach will be to start with the

782
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,700
trivial distinguisher that is output

783
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,580
zero and then keep repeating this step

784
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,500
over and over and over again until we

785
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,299
decide to stop depending on what

786
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,580
selectness we want to achieve

787
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,799
now the reason why this works the reason

788
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,500
why we actually get this amplifier is

789
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,399
because of the assumption that the C

790
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,240
elects is not good enough for every

791
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,220
choice to fix deduction you can actually

792
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,460
look at these four distributions and

793
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,860
we know that that the distance between x

794
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,740
x 1 and y1 and X zeroy zero is at least

795
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,440
the advantage of c and we can use this

796
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,720
assumption to bound the distance between

797
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,760
the top two and the bottom two and then

798
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,980
what you get is that there's enough

799
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,620
distance left for these two

800
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,559
distributions at the center uh which

801
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,740
basically says that uh I want I can do

802
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,240
the computation right now but it's not

803
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,240
very hard if you actually subtract from

804
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,779
the advantage of C these two uh these

805
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,020
two differences you can show that what

806
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,419
you get is an adversary with the

807
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,120
advantage that is better that is closer

808
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,020
to BX by at least the multiple of d y

809
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,380
okay so this is just a drawing to to uh

810
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,179
to demonstrate that right we start from

811
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,860
the distance the X from the X we start

812
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,440
from zero and we keep multiplying it by

813
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,279
d y so we get very close to DX

814
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,279
and for the difference we have to pay

815
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,320
with some slackness so the more time we

816
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,539
put in the closer where to DX the less

817
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,159
likeness we have to pay

818
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,679
and the last slide

819
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,140
um as a it's it is actually a

820
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,440
straightforward Corollary to arrive at

821
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,140
uh at the K products bound after you get

822
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,760
the isolated case that we've just

823
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,059
mentioned and for this bound you can

824
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,919
still preserve the good rate of between

825
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,159
uh slackness and the overhead of the

826
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,779
circuit size

827
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,039
uh in addition to that we also show that

828
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,460
these uh these ideas also generalize to

829
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,679
the uniform setting it takes a bit more

830
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,360
work but the general idea Remains the

831
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
Same the only disadvantage is that in

832
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,559
the uniform setting you no longer get

833
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,200
this good rate of this logarithmic

834
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,260
trade-off between the running time and

835
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,820
the between running time and the

836
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,799
slackness because intuitively you need

837
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,480
to use sampling and testing and in order

838
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,039
to sample and test within accuracy

839
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,100
Epsilon you need to work uh with respect

840
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,779
to one over Epsilon so this is

841
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,700
intuitively why the good rate of no

842
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,740
longer is no longer maintained in the

843
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,840
uniform setting and that would be all

844
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,399
thank you thank you very much

845
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
let's take the questions why the next

846
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,919
speaker sets up any questions

847
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,839
so I have one you mentioned something

848
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,659
about the sequential setting does your

849
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,139
result you think potentially generalized

850
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,440
to apply to interactive protocols or you

851
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,820
think it's kind of inherent to one

852
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,000
message

853
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,379
logarithmic overhead particularly

854
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,940
um so I think it uh

855
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,060
I didn't think about enough so I also uh

856
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,280
sorry I've asked this

857
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,540
is oh yeah

858
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,300
okay so uh

859
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,760
I didn't really uh completely think

860
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,399
about it I do think that because of the

861
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,260
nature of this uh I mean I know that

862
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,960
yeah solemus is uh generalized to the

863
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,540
case of interaction I think this should

864
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,460
already also be the case here because in

865
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,160
some sense I we don't use the rewinding

866
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,780
I think that was the problem

867
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,000
but I haven't completely verified it I

868
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,339
do think that it should also be you

869
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,980
should also be able to generalize it to

870
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,420
allow interaction

871
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,579
so I do think it should work thank you

872
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,280
so there was a question or yeah but it

873
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,720
was very high level but you said it's

874
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,300
very unique yeah this logarithmic

875
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,940
Improvement I guess yeah for their loss

876
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,339
so you don't have a sense which if there

877
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:24,780
are other applications of the hardcore

878
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,780
level whereas people vote

879
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,200
um no in fact I mean it's not like we

880
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,720
it's not like we replace the hardcore I

881
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,160
mean that column could be used in many

882
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,079
places and the other in the other places

883
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,820
we don't we don't know how to improve

884
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,820
only this one and I don't and I don't

885
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,619
know if you can also improve it in other

886
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,260
places I try to think about it but I

887
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,060
something something is just different

888
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,680
there I don't know I don't exactly know

889
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,099
how to point out the what's what is it

890
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,900
but I try to think about it in other

891
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,420
contexts for example your Sonoma and I

892
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,920
couldn't really see how you could

893
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,500
improve it to also have this trade of uh

894
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,020
in other settings

895
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,040
oh yeah uh yeah yes yes true yeah

896
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,380
thank you very much for the great talk

897
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,040
and the results

898
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,320
so the next two talks are shorter

899
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,200
they're technically soft marriage so the

900
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,880
first one and we will take the questions

901
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,280
about most of them at the end of the uh

902
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,680
both talks so the first one is secure

903
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,540
non-interactive simulation from

904
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,300
arbitrary joint distributions by Hamid

905
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,119
drizzle I mean for asconi Hamilton and

906
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,720
hi nicoyan and hamidraza is going to

907
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,379
give the talk

908
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,980
foreign

909
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,880
thank you for the intro introduction uh

910
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,220
this is a joint work with my advisor

911
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,520
hemanta Maji and my colleague I

912
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,280
so it's nice secure and interactive

913
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,440
simulation was introduced recently in

914
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,760
your clip

915
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,220
in essence Alice and Bob they want to

916
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,940
simulate a joint distribution uh

917
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,160
U UV which we call it a target

918
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,619
distribution using n independent samples

919
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,200
of another distribution X Y which we

920
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,480
call it Source distribution

921
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,780
and

922
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,800
so more specifically suppose uh

923
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,160
suppose uh Alice is given x n Bob is

924
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,700
given by n and such that x y and x y n

925
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,859
is like an independent samples of their

926
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,140
Source distribution and and if we want

927
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,540
to see whether there are reduction

928
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,520
functions FN and GN such that when

929
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,099
Addison bar they apply those reduction

930
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,760
functions on their uh samples marginal

931
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,579
samples the distribution of the output U

932
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,880
Prime V Prime is kilos to some Target

933
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,460
distribution UV and we also we required

934
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,980
that this uh reduction to be secure

935
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,119
which is like uh for Bob security xn has

936
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,859
no additional information about V Prime

937
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,440
then U Prime and similarly for credit

938
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,560
security we can Define it so suppose

939
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,079
that at least above the output M samples

940
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,300
instead of one sample what is the

941
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,880
maximum achievable ratio of the M

942
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,099
divided by n we call it the rate of the

943
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,920
essence uh

944
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,560
so a sneeze is in fact an information

945
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,540
theoretic analog of pseudo correlation

946
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,640
generator and it is also related to

947
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,440
related to other problems in information

948
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,060
Theory and theoretical computer science

949
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,079
so I use we okay in this stack I use two

950
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,260
notations BSS and Bs BSS is the binary

951
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,720
symmetric source with affiliate

952
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,820
probability Epsilon but instead of uh

953
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,680
instead of uh Epsilon I use rho which is

954
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,839
the Maxwell correlation and also the

955
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,420
same for BS we use a row which is the S

956
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,460
square root of 1 minus Epsilon this is

957
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,020
also the maximum correlation Maxwell

958
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,640
correlation is some concept in

959
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
information Theory it's not important

960
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,800
but uh absolutely is the Erasure

961
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,099
probability

962
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,320
so if this was introduced in these two

963
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,040
papers in your Crypt and

964
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,119
so otherwise how they showed a necessary

965
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,440
condition for instance of a general

966
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,820
Target distribution from a general

967
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,420
Source distribution uh in our paper our

968
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,940
Focus was in Europe it was on the

969
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,300
getting a list of PSS and Bs from BSS

970
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,420
and BSN and we we proved some results

971
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,700
for feasibility and rate but in this

972
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,520
stock uh our focus is on the case that

973
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,520
the target distribution is still pssps

974
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,400
but the source distribution is some

975
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,900
arbitrary distribution

976
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,599
and we showed that for any constant C

977
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,940
and for substantially large n we can see

978
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,220
that there is always a perfectly secure

979
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,820
uh sneeze or we get some C Over N in

980
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,160
security uh and we provided some

981
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,900
algorithm that we can determine whether

982
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,660
perfectly Securities exist or not and

983
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,460
our algorithm also retains the

984
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,280
construction in case it's such a SMS

985
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
exists for the rate we proved that any

986
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,920
feasible sneeze has constant rate the

987
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,920
rate is not zero and also we prove some

988
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,220
upper bound on the rate which the upper

989
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,660
one depends on the maximum correlation

990
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,060
of the target distribution and the

991
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,920
smallest magnitude eigenvalue of the

992
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,339
some linear operator associated with the

993
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,400
source distribution uh

994
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,740
but the most interesting result uh I can

995
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,020
say in our paper is this one it will

996
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,060
show that there is a source distribution

997
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,640
such that it's list of PSS and Bes from

998
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,859
that Source distribution has the

999
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,839
following property that for any linear

1000
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,660
reduction uh it is invisible but there

1001
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,280
is a non-linear reduction that achieves

1002
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,619
the optimal rate and now I'm going to

1003
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,500
explain so this result is interesting

1004
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,140
because in our local paper we had also

1005
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,079
non-linear reduction but they achieved

1006
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,359
the same rate as the linear reduction

1007
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,079
achieved so this is the that Source

1008
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,440
distribution uh roller and it gets a

1009
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,940
sample a b and Bob gets XC such that ABX

1010
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,839
are uniform and Z is equal to ax plus b

1011
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,200
and uh uh our uh our rate upper Bound

1012
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,480
for instance of PSS with Maxwell

1013
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,380
correlation half is uh this one is half

1014
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,180
and uh the question is that this is this

1015
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,300
rate achievable or not uh

1016
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,220
the best known construction before our

1017
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,220
work shows that the rate uh one third is

1018
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,780
achievable but using one round

1019
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,660
Communication in our work we don't use

1020
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,839
any communication and we achieve rate ha

1021
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,920
uh so this is the construction

1022
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,260
suppose Alice and Bob they they give two

1023
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,960
samples of roller so like X1 Z1 is

1024
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,240
correlated with A1 B1 a2b2 called a

1025
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,180
little bit exclusive so and it's output

1026
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,720
Alice checks whether her samples are

1027
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,780
they form a router and if that that

1028
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,820
happens then she outputs plus one

1029
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,520
otherwise she outputs minus one and Bob

1030
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,640
also does the same we showed that okay

1031
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,380
this is the

1032
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,920
reduction functions if you use the like

1033
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,460
minus and one yes instead of uh

1034
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,680
zero and one and we see that these are

1035
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,500
not linear constructions and we showed

1036
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,500
that any linear reduction is constant in

1037
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,520
secure

1038
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,260
uh

1039
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,380
and this is the summary of our work so

1040
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,140
we showed that that there is some Epson

1041
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,460
algorithm to design and find the

1042
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,140
construction it's such a construction

1043
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,660
exists and we've proved some upper bound

1044
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,700
and lower bounds and we show that

1045
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,440
there's not any reduction that keeps

1046
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,560
optimal rate and we use computer

1047
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,720
assisted search to design efficient

1048
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,060
protocols and we prove that any linear

1049
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,520
reduction for that construction is uh is

1050
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,140
a constant in section

1051
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,540
uh thanks thank you very much

1052
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,819
I would be happy to answer to your

1053
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:21,140
questions after the next talk

1054
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,319
so let me introduce the next talks

1055
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,359
speaker and authors so it's going to be

1056
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,420
secure non-attractive reducibility is

1057
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,760
decidable that's the title

1058
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,640
by car take Bouchon

1059
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,000
pancake Kumar misra Varun arayanan and

1060
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,180
Manoj prabhakaran and Varun is going to

1061
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,720
give the talk

1062
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,440
am I Audible

1063
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,920
thank you so this presentation is also

1064
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,920
on uh let's say in the same model of

1065
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,220
secure non-interactive simulation but uh

1066
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,900
we will use a slightly different

1067
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,339
terminology and we'll be calling it

1068
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,800
secure non-interactive reductions or

1069
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,619
snir for short because this is the

1070
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,200
terminology that we used in the paper

1071
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,960
so the main result of this talk is

1072
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,880
exactly what the title says secure

1073
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
non-interactive reducability is

1074
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,119
decidable

1075
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,220
so what is the secure non-interactive

1076
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,099
reduction problem or snir problem

1077
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,160
so we are given two correlations a

1078
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,560
source correlation a Target correlation

1079
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,260
uh that is the source correlation is X

1080
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,819
comma y in the third correlation is U

1081
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,560
comma V and we want to know whether

1082
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,260
there is a statistical snir for securely

1083
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,140
sampling UV given x y

1084
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,640
more formally

1085
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,680
we want to know whether for every

1086
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,359
positive Epsilon

1087
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,420
there exists in epsilon snir

1088
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,839
that securely samples u v given some N

1089
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,079
Sub Epsilon copies of X Y so when we say

1090
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,400
epsilon sin IR we mean nsynier with at

1091
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,579
most Epsilon correctness and uh security

1092
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,700
error and think of this in sub Epsilon

1093
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,000
as an arbitrarily large number

1094
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,880
so uh in order to show that this is

1095
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,819
decidable the main theorem that we use

1096
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,819
uh states that statistical snar is going

1097
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,040
to imply perfectness

1098
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,400
so what does this mean so the theorem

1099
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,099
states that there is a statistical snar

1100
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,880
for UV given X Y only if

1101
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,160
there is a perfect snar with perfect

1102
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,079
correctness and perfect security

1103
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,500
that samples UV using N Sub Zero copies

1104
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,839
of X comma Y where N Sub 0 should be

1105
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,660
thought of as a constant that is decided

1106
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,000
by the description of the correlations U

1107
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,800
V and X Y

1108
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,020
now as a

1109
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,540
immediate corollary of this we get that

1110
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,859
the snir problem is decidable

1111
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,859
furthermore if there is a statistical

1112
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:23,940
resonator

1113
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,380
then there is an algorithm that actually

1114
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,000
outputs a perfect smile at for the same

1115
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,839
problem

1116
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,640
so going from the theorem to this

1117
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,859
corollary is rather straightforward

1118
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,079
so we can build an algorithm that takes

1119
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,119
the description of the source and Target

1120
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,560
correlations

1121
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,220
and computes this number N Sub Zero

1122
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,900
that's given in the theorem

1123
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,660
and then it searches through all

1124
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,099
possible

1125
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,200
you know

1126
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,000
reduction functions or what we call

1127
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,339
protocols and see if there is a perfect

1128
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,900
snir

1129
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,599
taking X Y to u v

1130
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,140
if there is one then the algorithm can

1131
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,660
always output a perfect scenario and the

1132
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,099
theorem states that if there is none

1133
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,500
then it's in the statistical snar itself

1134
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,839
is impossible

1135
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,540
so uh because we don't have a lot of

1136
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,400
time I will try to

1137
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,740
uh give a brief

1138
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,980
intuition behind how we show that

1139
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,440
statistical snar is

1140
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,200
going to imply perfectly scenario

1141
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,760
so

1142
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,880
um

1143
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,460
yeah so let's start with a

1144
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,680
so let's start with a protocol that is

1145
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,800
an snir protocol a comma B that realizes

1146
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,740
an Epsilon snar securely sampling a copy

1147
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,020
of the target correlation using say n

1148
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,780
copies of the source correlation so

1149
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,200
think of uh D and C as the probability

1150
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,859
Mass functions of these two correlations

1151
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,079
jumping ahead what we are going to show

1152
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,359
is that

1153
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,160
these two uh reduction functions or

1154
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,720
protocols A and B

1155
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,660
they look only at a constant number of

1156
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,640
copies of the C that is just taking as

1157
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,560
input remember it's taking n copies of

1158
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,420
the correlation as input but what we're

1159
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,680
saying is that the protocol a

1160
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,839
effectively looks only at a constant

1161
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,960
size subset of these n copies

1162
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,240
and this constant is going to depend on

1163
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,980
the description of the source and Target

1164
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,599
correlations

1165
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,380
but now what this means is that if there

1166
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,619
is a statistical snar

1167
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:45,300
uh 4D using C then

1168
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,420
for every Epsilon positive but however

1169
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,480
small it is there is a protocol that

1170
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,700
uses only a constant number of copies of

1171
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,400
the correlation and gives you an snar

1172
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,660
that is

1173
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,960
uh less than Epsilon that has less than

1174
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Epsilon security and correctness error

1175
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,220
but this since there are only a finite

1176
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,839
number of

1177
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,740
you know protocols that take n copies I

1178
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,359
mean like the constant number of copies

1179
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,560
of C uh and that's a reduction

1180
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,500
this should mean that there should be a

1181
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,819
protocol that is uh realizing

1182
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:29,160
perfect snir

1183
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,819
so so what goes into this how much time

1184
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:36,119
do I have one and a half minutes so what

1185
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,060
goes into this so we start with a

1186
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,359
certain notion of spectral protocol that

1187
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,540
is so a has a linear transformation that

1188
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,460
gives you a so-called spectral protocol

1189
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,420
a hat and we realized that this a hat is

1190
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,740
in some sense a Fourier transform of the

1191
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,480
protocol a itself

1192
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,920
and then we note that this uh

1193
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,280
this a is so that the Fourier transform

1194
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,180
concentrates most of its energy in like

1195
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,579
uh low degree coefficients that is it

1196
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,220
concentrates on basis functions Each of

1197
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,660
which depends on a few number of

1198
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,800
variables

1199
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,440
but then this is perfect for us to apply

1200
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,359
a hunter theorem that says that if this

1201
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,640
is the case then a should be a function

1202
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,420
that depends only on a few of the uh you

1203
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,819
know few of the coordinates of the

1204
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:30,900
function itself

1205
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,920
so we could not find a junta theorem

1206
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,140
that works for a generalized Fourier

1207
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,180
transform of this kind so we stated and

1208
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,300
proved the such a Honda theorem and this

1209
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,880
might be of independent interest

1210
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,500
and

1211
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,780
yeah this is how we

1212
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,839
show that there exists a perfect snirer

1213
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,000
for a d using C if there is a statistic

1214
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,859
lesson here

1215
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,740
so in conclusion we showed that

1216
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,720
statistical snar problem is decidable

1217
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,819
there are two interesting open problems

1218
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,079
the first one

1219
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,740
is about the rate of statistical snar we

1220
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,500
it it's still open to characterize the

1221
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,420
exact rate of statistics

1222
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,900
and the other one would be to

1223
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,240
think about what would happen if we

1224
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,940
allow interactions what kind of uh

1225
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,880
results can we get and this would relate

1226
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,220
directly with OT complexity of a

1227
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,339
function computation and so on

1228
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,720
thank you thank you very much

1229
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,200
quick questions for Ahmad razan Aaron if

1230
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,520
you have a question for one of them

1231
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,319
specifically mentioned it

1232
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,619
otherwise I guess it's to both of them

1233
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,900
questions you had any questions

1234
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,540
I asked what for natural

1235
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,359
distribution is like OT

1236
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,839
um joint OT correlations do we have a

1237
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,660
characterization of what correlations

1238
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,180
imply them

1239
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,859
for things that we care about

1240
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,559
particularly say OT or is it a very hard

1241
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,260
question so an earlier work I talked

1242
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,480
about what are some necessary conditions

1243
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,780
that are directly

1244
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,040
that can be directly used to tell

1245
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,920
whether there is a snar from a source to

1246
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,359
a Target but then this so if we look at

1247
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:26,880
this particular result itself it is

1248
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,240
talking about a number N Sub 0 which

1249
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,619
could be potentially really large

1250
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,240
depending on the description of the two

1251
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,940
correlations so it's not easy to run a

1252
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,099
program to find this so you're sure it's

1253
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:41,040
decidable but for specific cases do we

1254
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,900
have like noise so there are a few set

1255
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,640
of results that says that the OT

1256
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,319
correlation cannot be realized using

1257
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,300
binary Erasure correlation and things

1258
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,240
like that we know some phase okay but

1259
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,980
any other questions

1260
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,319
so before finishing the session just be

1261
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,880
aware that this brick is actually

1262
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,280
shorter it's unfortunate that this time

1263
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,900
that the brick is shorter we are ending

1264
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,420
later than the typical time but and the

1265
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,359
break is going to be about 15 minutes I

1266
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,559
guess a little bit even shorter than

1267
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,619
that any other question or otherwise

1268
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,720
let's thank both of the speakers and all

1269
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,500
the speakers on session
