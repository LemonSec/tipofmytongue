nowadays after pandemic the borders are

151
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,259
mostly open so most of the countries

152

people from most of the country are able

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,780
to come with a Visa free entry it's very

154
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,860
convenient and we are experienced to

155
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,639
help with people from other countries

156
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,099
that need to apply for the Visa and they

157
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,599

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,958
the ITC or

170
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,020
um I didn't prepare the slides so maybe

171
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,659
no no

172
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,380
that's fine

173
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,839
or maybe maybe it's here

174
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,700
yeah

175
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,399
good yeah and we have it here it's good

176
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,620
yeah this is like a last minute uh

177
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,279
commercial break

178
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,500
uh Benny app Obama asked us to share

179
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,100
good

180
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,600
um yeah

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,060
announcing IPC let me see I haven't

182
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,580
looked at the slides yet uh early John

183
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,240
uh June in oros University Denmark this

184
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,540
is I guess the third one I'm not sure

185
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,560
um

186
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,620
foreign yeah anyway I wasn't the last

187
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,660
one I was really great

188
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,940
um so it will have two tracks except the

189
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,959
papers and Spotlight invited talks

190
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,519
um

191
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,220
yeah and what else hope to see you there

192
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,800
there was another one yeah good this is

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,260
a general uh

194
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,660
call for papers for ITC so I think

195
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,100
there's a lot of intersection between

196
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,839
TCC and ITC uh

197
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,120
anyway the next person is used so I

198
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,040
guess uh this is this is not an

199
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,620
exhaustive list of topics really it's uh

200
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,959
uh came in actually added one more which

201
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,000
is sort of adversarial machine learning

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
you know which has information periodic

203
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,560
components so really uh you know um one

204
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,240
thing I one other thing I want to say

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,800

206
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
