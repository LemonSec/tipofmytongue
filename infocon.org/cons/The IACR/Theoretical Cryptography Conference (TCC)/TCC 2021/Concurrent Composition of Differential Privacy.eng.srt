1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,879
hi i'm ken hao i'm a phd student at

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,000
princeton

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,839
today i will talk about our work on the

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,279
concurrent composition of different

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,480
privacy

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
it's a joint work with professor sulio

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
vadhan

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,960
i will first introduce the background of

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,520
the paper and our main contribution

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
then i will talk about some basic

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,279
definitions and properties

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,640
then i will go through some of the

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
proofs of our main results

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,080
and finally i will discuss the

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,519
limitations and possible future works

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,160
yeah so differential privacy is the

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
dominant premise notion nowadays the

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
main idea of differential privacy is to

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,640
carefully randomize an algorithm so that

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,040
its output does not depend too much on

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,160
any single individual in the data set

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,200
that is

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,920
for a different private mechanism

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
the probability distribution of the

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
magnet's output of a data set should be

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,760
nearly identical to the distribution of

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,559
its outputs on the same data set with

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
any single individual's data replaced

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,600
to formalize this we call two data sets

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,640
adjacent if they are differed by at most

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
one row a magnesium or a function is

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
epsilon not differentially private if

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,799
for any adjacent data set x and x prime

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,960
for every possible output event t

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,520
the probability that we see t when the

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
data set is x

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
is at most e to the epsilon times the

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240
probability that we see t when the data

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,680
set is x prime

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
plus delta

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
um and the probability space is over the

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
conflict of the algorithm

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,320
the epsilon is typically referred as

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
privacy loss or privacy budget

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
it could be a small constant but not

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
only not negligible

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
the delta is also incorporated since it

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,399
turns out that it's quite useful to have

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,200
one

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
which we'll see it

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,399
very soon

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,399
the delta can be interpreted as an upper

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,560
bound on the probability of catastrophic

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
failure

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
for example the entire dataset being

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,880
published

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
so it is sometimes called a security

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,000
parameter

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
in the literature when the delta is zero

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
the node the notion is often referred as

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,599
pure differential privacy and when the

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
delta is greater than zero the notion is

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,359
called approximate differential privacy

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
one of the central properties of

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,720
differential privacy uh which we we will

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
also use it uh later in our proof later

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
is that it is preserved under

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
post-processing

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,160
that is

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
a data analyst without additional

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,280
knowledge about the private big database

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
cannot compute a function of the output

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
of a private algorithm m and make it

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
less difficult private

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
in other words differential privacy is

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
robust against further process of a

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
previous magnet output

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
another useful property is that

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
diffusion privacy provides protections

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
for small groups of individuals

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,920
in general epsilon delta differential

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
privacy is designed to protect the

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,319
privacy between neighboring data bases

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
which differ only in one row

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
this means that no adversary with

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,959
arbitrary auxiliary information can know

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,599
if one particular participant is in the

88
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,360
data set or not

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,840
however this is also extendable if we

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
want to protect databases differing in

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,680
more than one rows

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
for example a family

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,440
a very simple hybrid argument can show

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,239
that for a pair of data sets that differ

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,760
by k rows

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,519
there are still privacy guarantees for

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,760
the two output distributions

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,519
with sound degradation in epsilon delta

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
parameters

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
one of the most important properties of

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,959
the visual privacy set

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
it permits the analysis of cumulative

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,599
privacy loss under the composition of

104
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
multiple magnesius

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,760
if we run multiple distinct differential

106
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,239
primary algorithms on the same data set

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
the resulting composed algorithm is also

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
differentially private with sound

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
degradation in the price parameters

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
epsilon delta

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
this property is especially important

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
and useful since in practice we rarely

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,319
want to release only a single statistic

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,238
about the data set

115
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,639
releasing many statistics may require

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,120
running multiple and different kinds of

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
differential private algorithms on the

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
same database

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
composition is also a very useful tool

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
in august design in many cases

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,000
new division private algorithms are

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
created by combining several simpler

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
algorithms

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
the composition theorems can help us to

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
analyze the privacy of algorithms

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
designed in this way

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
there are already many conversation

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
theorems exist in the literature

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
the basic composition theorem says that

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,040
the privacy degrades at most linearly

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
with the number of mechanisms executed

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
however if we are willing to tolerate an

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
increase in the dollar term

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
the privacy parameter epsilon only needs

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
to degrade proportionally to the square

136
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
root of the number of mechanisms

137
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,960
executed

138
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
the advanced composition theorem is

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
still not exact it has been shown how to

140
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
compute the optimal bound for composing

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960
k magnitudes uh which we'll go over them

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,758
later in this talk

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,759
and all the composition theorems apply

144
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,280
for arbitrary kinds of differential

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
private magnets

146
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
if we know the specific properties of

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
the underlying db algorithms we can

148
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
further improve the privacy composition

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,599
bond

150
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
for example moment the content which is

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
used in computing the privacy loss

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
in differentially private stochastic

153
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,919
gradient descent

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,479
of the composition theorems discussed

155
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,080
above focus on or implicitly assume that

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
the underlying dp mechanisms are

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
one-shot algorithms that only up to one

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
answer

159
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
however many of the useful

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
differential privacy

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,240
primitives

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
such as sparse vector technique

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,199
are actually interactive magnets which

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,560
allow one to ask an adaptive sequence of

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,720
queries about the data set

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,919
for instance

167
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
sparse factor technique could

168
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,919
potentially accept infinite amount of

169
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,560
quarries while paying price cost only

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
for quarries that are greater than the

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
noisy threshold

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
and is very useful for example svt is

173
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,560
used in adaptive data analysis to

174
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
prevent overfitting and to deploy dp in

175
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
practice people might also want to

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,280
support interactive queries

177
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,319
a natural question regarding interactive

178
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,199
dp

179
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
mechanisms is whether the differential

180
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
privacy is also preserved under

181
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,240
composition

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
however there could be more than one

183
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
composition operations for interactive

184
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
magnets

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
the most straightforward one is

186
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
sequential composition

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
where the adversaries interact with

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,720
session with one magnesium must be

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
halted before it starts an interactive

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,759
session with another mechanism

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
in this case of the composition theorems

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,880
we discussed earlier still applies

193
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,160
however a reality strike is that

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
a single adversary could interact with

195
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,199
multiple magazines concurrently

196
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
where different threads of interactive

197
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
sessions can be arbitrarily interleaved

198
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
with each other

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
that is

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
although each response outputs by

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,639
different magazines are generated

202
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,840
independently

203
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
the adversary however

204
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,319
may coordinate the actions it takes in

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,840
the various executions of interactive

206
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
sessions and in particular its actions

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
in one execution may also depend on

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,400
messages it received

209
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
in other executions

210
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
unfortunately none of the existing

211
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,080
composition theorems for non-interactive

212
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,599
dp can be applied directly to the

213
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,680
setting of concurrent compositions

214
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,039
to the best of our knowledge this work

215
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
is the first to tackle the problem of

216
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
concurrent compositions of interactive

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
differential privacy

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
here are our main results

219
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
we derive a bond that is similar to

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,599
group privacy

221
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,759
for the concurrent composition of pure

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,319
interrupt vp the privacy degrades at

223
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
most linearly with the number of magnets

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
concurrently executed

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,159
which is the same as non-interrupt dp

226
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,159
however for concurrent composition of

227
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,479
approximate interrupt dp magnesiums it

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
is worse than even the basic composition

229
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,200
theorem of non-interrupt dp in the

230
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
downturn

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
we then characterize a pure

232
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
pure interrupt dp magnesium as a

233
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
post-processing of randomized response

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
a non-interrupted

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
mechanism and obtain the optimal privacy

236
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
bond for the composition of pure

237
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
interactive dp by taking the optimal

238
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
composition of non-interrupt

239
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,279
differential privacy since we know that

240
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
dp is closed under post processing

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
unfortunately

242
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,880
we still don't know much about the

243
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
concurrent composition of of approximate

244
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
interactive differential privacy

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,680
we believe the bounds we got

246
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,560
are far from the correct answer

247
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
based on computer simulation we

248
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
conjucture that optimal composition

249
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,200
bound may also hold for approximate dp

250
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,279
okay now we talk about sound

251
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
formalization and basic properties of

252
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
concurrent dp composition

253
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
we first formalize the notion of

254
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
interactive protocol

255
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
an interrupt protocol is between two

256
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
parties a and b

257
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,160
we do this by viewing each party as a

258
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
potentially randomized function

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
taking its private input

260
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,240
and the parties running coins

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
and all messages it has received

262
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
to the party's next message to be sent

263
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,040
out

264
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,600
we further define the view of a party in

265
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
an interactive protocol which is

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,480
essentially everything the party sees

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
including the party's readiness

268
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
and its private input

269
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
and the message is received

270
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,120
in our case

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,079
a is the adversary and b is the magazine

272
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,959
whose input is usually a database

273
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
since the the adversary does not have an

274
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
input in our case and we will only be

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,480
interested in the adversaries view will

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,519
drop the subscript

277
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
now we're ready to formally define the

278
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
interactive differential privacy as a

279
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,160
type of interactive protocol between an

280
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
adversary and an interactive mechanism

281
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,720
specifically an interactive magazine is

282
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,880
epsilon delta diffusion private

283
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
if for every

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,200
adjacent data set x and x prime

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
for any adversary algorithm a for any

286
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
possible event t of the view of the

287
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
adversary

288
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
the probability that we see t

289
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
when the data set is x

290
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,079
is at most e to the epsilon times the

291
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,959
probability that we see t when the data

292
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,518
data set is x prime plus delta

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,279
we use this special

294
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,880
notation to denote the concurrent

295
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,760
composition of magnesium m0 to mk minus

296
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,959
one

297
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
the main difficulty of analyzing the

298
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,120
privacy loss of concurrent composition

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,079
is that

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,839
for sequential composition or

301
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,760
non-interactive composition

302
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,839
the output messages from previous

303
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,240
magazines are simply the auxiliary

304
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
knowledge of the adversary

305
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,920
and the magnificent is interacting with

306
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
an ad with an adversary of a fixed

307
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,240
strategy so the vp guarantee applies

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
however

309
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
for concurrent composition

310
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
since the adversary will receive

311
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
messages from other magazines during the

312
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
introductory session

313
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
the adversary's strategy is not fixed

314
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
and can change during the interactive

315
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,240
session so the magazine is essentially

316
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
interacting with a different adversary

317
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
for every query it receives

318
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
so the dp guarantee may not directly

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
apply in this case

320
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
for the conv for the convenience of our

321
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,399
proof

322
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
we introduce a variant of concrete

323
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
composition of interactive protocols uh

324
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,519
which only accept quarries in the exact

325
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,240
order of the k magnesiums

326
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,040
m0 m1 to m sub k minus 1.

327
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
like the first chord is sent to m0 the

328
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,600
second is sent to m1 the third is sent

329
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,519
to m2 etc and after

330
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,560
mk minus one uh the next query goes to

331
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,959
m0 again

332
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
we also introduce a special kind of

333
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
interactive mechanism the noun query

334
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
extension

335
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,440
the noun chord extension of a magnesium

336
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
has the exact same output distribution

337
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,760
fc as the original interactive session

338
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
except that it will accept and ignore

339
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,079
of the the noun query or we can call

340
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
them dummy query one will not get any

341
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,920
answer from those queries

342
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,399
based on the two concepts introduced we

343
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,120
derive a lemma which says that in order

344
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
to prove the concrete composition of k

345
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,320
magnesiums is epsilon delta dp

346
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
it's enough to show that

347
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,399
the ordered concurrent composition of

348
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
non-core extension of these these

349
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
magnesiums is also epsilon delta dp

350
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
the intuition is that if the first

351
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,320
quarry is is sent to mri and the second

352
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,720
quarter is sent to mj then we will fill

353
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
in a dummy query and central magnesium

354
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
between mi and mj

355
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
given this lemma for all of the concrete

356
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
composition proofs in our paper

357
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
we assume without loss of generality

358
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
that the concurrent composition are

359
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
ordered

360
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,920
that is

361
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,800
the else quarry is sent to magnificent l

362
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,639
mode k

363
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
in particular if an adversary a is

364
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
concurrently interacting with two

365
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
magnesiums we assume that the quarry

366
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
alternates between them

367
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,800
okay

368
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
now we try to analyze the concurrent

369
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,120
composition for pure interactive dp

370
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
magnesiums

371
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
we start with the simplest case of

372
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,680
composing two magnesiums

373
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
given an interactive protocol where the

374
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,399
adversary is concurrently interacting

375
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,279
with two magnesiums m and m tilde

376
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,240
the idea is that its interaction with

377
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,639
one magnesium could be viewed as a

378
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,279
combination of the adversary and the

379
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
answer magnets interacting with that

380
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,959
magnesium

381
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
and the differential privacy guarantee

382
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,880
still holds for this combined adversary

383
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
we call this combined anniversary as a

384
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
star

385
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
specifically we can see that a star is a

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
well-defined adversary strategy

387
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
throughout the entire interactive

388
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
session with m

389
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,199
as the redness of a star is fixed

390
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
as the redness of

391
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
a and m tilde

392
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,680
and the function for computing the next

393
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,599
query is also naturally defined

394
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,839
therefore the differential price

395
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,720
guarantee applies to the view of this

396
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,079
combined adversary a star

397
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,000
and we also observed that

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
given a transcript of a star's view we

399
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,839
can recover the view of a through

400
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
post-processing

401
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
which is also quite straightforward like

402
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,440
every quarry sent to m tilde is derived

403
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
from the address 3a

404
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,079
and then we can derive the answers from

405
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,638
m tilde

406
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,519
because of this post-processing

407
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,000
algorithm for any event t

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
the probability that

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,320
a's field is in t

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
is exactly equal to the probability that

411
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,079
a star's view is in the inverse of the

412
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,920
post-processing algorithm of event t

413
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
and also as we said earlier

414
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
since a star is well defined

415
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
the random variable of a stars view

416
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,920
enjoys differential privacy guarantee

417
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,399
to introduce the final conclusion we say

418
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,199
that

419
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,319
two random variables x and x prime are

420
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,640
epsilon delta indistinguishable if for

421
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
every event t

422
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
the probability that we see t for random

423
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
variable x

424
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,439
is at most e to the epsilon times the

425
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
probability that we see t for random

426
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
variable x prime

427
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,480
plus delta

428
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
and vice versa

429
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,520
a very simple proof can show that if x

430
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
and x prime are epsilon zero

431
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,559
indistinguishable and x prime and x

432
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,039
double prime are epsilon to the zero

433
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,480
indistinguishable

434
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
then x and x double prime are epsilon

435
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,919
plus epsilon tilde zero

436
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,919
indistinguishable

437
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,400
suppose magnesium m is epsilon zero

438
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,520
interactive dp and m tilde is epsilon

439
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
tilde zero interactive dp

440
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,640
because of the price guarantees from the

441
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
definition of interactive differential

442
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,480
privacy we know that the view of a star

443
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,280
against m x versus m x prime are epsilon

444
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,600
zero indistinguishable

445
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,559
and because we can recover the view of a

446
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,440
through post-processing and dp is

447
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,160
preserved under post-processing

448
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
we know that a's view are epsilon 0

449
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
indistinguishable

450
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
between when concurrently interacting

451
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
with m x and m tilde x

452
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,200
and when concretely interacting with m x

453
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,799
prime and m tilde x

454
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,919
symmetrically we can obtain a similar

455
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,640
indistinguishability result if we define

456
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,840
a and magnesium m as a combined

457
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,520
adversary interacting with m tilde

458
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
finally we are able to obtain the bound

459
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
of the privacy loss of the adversaries

460
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
wheel based on the simple transitivity

461
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
property of epsilon 0 in

462
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,080
distinguishability

463
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
and we can extend this result to the

464
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
case of composing more than two

465
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,799
magnesiums by induction

466
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,640
this result tells us that under

467
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,480
concurrent composition the basic

468
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
composition theorem for pure dp still

469
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,919
holds

470
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,880
that is the privacy parameters of the

471
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,600
resulting composed magnesium are the sum

472
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
up of the individual algorithms for the

473
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
case of pure differential privacy

474
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
and now we turn to the concrete

475
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,679
composition of approximate interactive

476
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,559
differential privacy

477
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,280
for the concurrent composition of

478
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
approximate interactive differential

479
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,080
privacy it is natural to think whether

480
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
we can bounce the privacy loss using a

481
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,640
proof technique that is similar to what

482
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,360
we did for pure dp

483
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
it turns out that we can but the

484
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,840
resulting privacy parameter is not the

485
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,559
same as non-interrupt vp in this case

486
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
suppose each magnesiums are epsilon i

487
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,200
delta i differentially private

488
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
for particular magnesium mi

489
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,840
by viewing the other three and the rest

490
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
of n minus one magnesium as a combined

491
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
adversary

492
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
we can obtain the following price

493
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,440
guarantee by a very similar argument as

494
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,159
we did in the proof for pure dp

495
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
by conducting the above thought

496
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,080
experiment for every magnesium mi we can

497
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,640
bounce the price loss through a simple

498
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
hybrid argument

499
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
and we can eventually obtain

500
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
a concurrent composition theorem for

501
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
approximate differential privacy

502
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,159
however we can see that in this case

503
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,000
the delta term for the concurrent

504
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,039
composition does not add up as what we

505
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,600
have for non-interrupt dp

506
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
moreover it depends on the permutation

507
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,240
order of m0 to m k minus 1.

508
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
therefore we give an upper bound for the

509
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,159
third term which is potentially easier

510
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,080
to work with

511
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
also we note that

512
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,600
each mi has the same parameters of

513
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
epsilon and delta

514
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
and the bound is the same as group

515
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,159
privacy so therefore we refer to this

516
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,400
privacy bond as group 5 select bond

517
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
here's our another contribution in this

518
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,559
co in this project um which will try to

519
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
make a reduction from interrupt dp

520
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
magnesium to non-interactive dp

521
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
mechanism

522
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,840
randomized response is a very simple

523
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,679
non-interactive differentially private

524
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,640
mechanism which takes a binary bit as

525
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,520
input

526
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,320
and output a randomized version of the

527
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
input bit

528
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
this is the epsilon delta variant of

529
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
randomized response

530
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
where the magnitude will simply telling

531
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,280
the true input bit with probability

532
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,240
delta

533
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,640
and we can easily verify that this

534
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
magnesium is epsilon delta differential

535
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,520
private

536
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
a key step to prove the optimal

537
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,679
composition theorem of non-interactive

538
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,919
dp algorithms is that

539
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
epsilon delta randomized response can

540
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
simulate any non-interrupt

541
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,559
non-interactive epsilon delta dp

542
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,320
magnesium through post processing

543
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,280
since we know that differential privacy

544
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,159
is preserved under post-processing it

545
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,360
follows that

546
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,520
to analyze the composition of arbitrary

547
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,159
non-interactive vp algorithms

548
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
it suffices to analyze the composition

549
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
of randomized response

550
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
if we are able to prove a similar result

551
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
for interactive

552
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,039
differential privacy then we will be

553
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,280
able to extend of the composition

554
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
theorem for non-interactive mechanisms

555
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,280
to interactive magnets

556
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,280
so in this work we find that every

557
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,080
interactive epsilon zero dp magnesium

558
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,880
can be simulated as the post-processing

559
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
of randomized response

560
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,400
where the post-processing function

561
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,360
itself is interactive

562
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,000
that is for every interactive magnesium

563
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
that is

564
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
epsilon zero diffusion private and every

565
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,080
neighboring data set x and x prime

566
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
we could uh construct such an

567
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,640
interactive um we can construct such an

568
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
interactive post-processing magazine t

569
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,600
um so that is a view of the adversary

570
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,039
interacting with m

571
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,600
has the exact same distribution as a

572
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,240
view of the atmosphere interacting with

573
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
t given a random bit from epsilon zero

574
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,039
randomized response

575
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
the proof idea is by setting the two

576
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
distributions to be the same and then

577
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,760
derive t

578
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,240
it's mainly technical and quite involved

579
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,039
so

580
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,200
i do not go into too much detail to that

581
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
proof

582
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,200
therefore to analyze the privacy laws of

583
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,840
composing arbitrary pure interrupt vdp

584
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,919
algorithms

585
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,039
we can instead analyze the privacy loss

586
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
of the composing composing randomized

587
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,320
response of the same privacy parameters

588
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
since differential privacy is preserved

589
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,440
under any post-processing

590
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,200
the final bond for the privacy parameter

591
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
for the concurrent composition of pure

592
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,400
interaction dp is the same as the

593
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
optimal composition bond for

594
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,360
non-interactive dp magnesiums

595
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,799
the major limitation of this work is

596
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,880
that we still don't know much about the

597
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,960
concurrent composition of approximate

598
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,880
interactive vp

599
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,600
so we ran a little bit experiments try

600
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,039
to get uh some insights

601
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,520
we evaluate whether there exists a

602
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,320
two-round magazine with one-bit

603
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,799
messages can be simulated as the

604
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
interactive post-processing of

605
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
randomized response

606
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
we note that the concurrent composition

607
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,120
of two copies of such a magnesium

608
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,400
already has a non-trivial interleaving

609
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,919
in all in all of our trials we find that

610
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,679
a feasible interactive post-processing

611
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,120
mechanism

612
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,400
therefore

613
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
we conjuncture that

614
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
the concurrent composition of indirect

615
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,360
dp magnesiums may still have the same

616
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,520
bond as the composition for

617
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,320
non-interrupt dp magnesiums

618
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
and we may still be able to prove it

619
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,720
through a similar construction of

620
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,679
interactive post-processing mechanisms

621
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,080
this means that every interrupt dp

622
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,720
magnesium may be reduced to

623
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
non-interactive

624
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
randomized response

625
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,799
okay thank you for your listening
