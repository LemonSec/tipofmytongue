00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,560
hi everyone

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,960
the topic of our paper is on

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,279
derandomizing yao's weak to strong

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,800
one-way function construction

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,280
this is a joint work with chris

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,480
brzezuska

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,480
joshua

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,039
first let's start with some definitions

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
so

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,599
first

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
what is a weak one-way function

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,960
so

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
let me define that

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,239
we say that

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,760
if

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,640
is

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,840
a

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,960
weak one-way function

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,239
if

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,680
for all probabilistic polynomial time

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,320
adversaries a

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
the probability

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,199
that the adversary when given the output

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,879
of the function

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
returns a correct pre-image of the

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
function

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
if this probability is at most

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,760
1 minus

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,080
1 over p of

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,119
n

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,080
where

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
n

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,799
is

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,680
the length of the input

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
so our x is sampled uniformly at random

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
from big strings of length n

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,680
and now here

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
this p should be some polynomial

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,240
and sometimes we write

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
that

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,119
if is a p weak one-way function to

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,320
emphasize that

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,399
this is the polynomial

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,360
so

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,560
weak one-way functions can be inverted

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,399
in all but

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
this polynomial fraction of inputs so

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,040
it's indeed very weak

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
concept of one-way function

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,239
and now the next strong one-way function

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,239
so let's define that

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,959
what is a strong one-way function

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,920
so

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,599
strong one-way function is the usual

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,480
notion of one-way function

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,599
that we have

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,480
so we say that g

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
is

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
strong

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
one-way function

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,840
or just one-way function

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
if

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
for all probabilistic polynomial time

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
adversaries

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
the probability

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
that this adversary when given the

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
output of the

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,000
function returns a correct

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
pre-image

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
of g of x

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,920
if this probability is negligible

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,559
in the input length

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
all right so now we know what are we

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
borrowing functions and what a strong

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,319
one-way function so what is the

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
construction by yao

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
so

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
uh

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
a famous theorem by y'all from fox 82

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
was that if we have a weak one-way

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
function so if

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,159
uh

83
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,200
if

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,080
f

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,959
is

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,159
a

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,599
p

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
weak

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
one-way function

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
then

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
the following g

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,120
which

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
looks like this it takes some long input

94
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
x1

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,959
to

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,760
xl

97
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,120
and

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
then we define the output of g as

99
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,040
concatenation of a bunch of calls to the

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
weak one-way function f

101
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
so f of x one

102
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
concatenated with f of x two etc

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
until f of

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
x l

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,478
now this famous theorem by yao says that

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,560
such a g

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,839
is a

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
strong

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
one-way function

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,759
if

111
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
this l here

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
is

113
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,840
of

114
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,360
at least

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
the length of each of these

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
x i's that we have here

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
uh

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
times this polynomial p of the length of

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
uh

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
this weak one-way function inputs

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
all right

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
so if we take uh

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
this many of these calls to the weak

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
one-way function

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,199
then the result in g is a strong one-way

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,600
function

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
all right

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,919
so now we know what is weak on my

129
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
function what is a strong on my function

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
and what was this yao's construction how

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
to get strong one-way functions

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520
if we have a weak one-way function

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
and

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
now uh what do that do i mean by

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
de-randomizing in this context and i'll

136
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,199
show that

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,440
so first

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,240
let's write this yaw construction that

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
we have here

140
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,600
uh

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,680
let's write this in a circuit notation

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
so

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,759
we would have

144
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,720
our

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,759
ge

146
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,360
that takes some

147
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
inputs so

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
take some

149
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,800
x1

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
to xl

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
inputs and then it feeds each of these

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
inputs to

153
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
this layer of calls to the

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
to the weak one-way function

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
and we get this result some

156
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
y one

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
two y

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
l

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
and we return these

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,880
so

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
uh

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,440
this is

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
nothing nothing fancy i just rewrote

164
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,919
this definition of g

165
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,240
as a circuit

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,560
now

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,400
the question we are interested in is

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
is it possible to have shorter input

169
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,759
here to the g

170
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
so now uh since each of these

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,960
calls to the weak one-way function f

172
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,960
takes individual random input uh

173
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,600
completely independent random inputs

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
uh it means that g must have very long

175
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
input

176
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
it was this

177
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
polynomially

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
long input

179
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,720
so in other words

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
we are interested in whether we can use

181
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,840
less randomness

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
and

183
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
i can write this again

184
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
more precisely using this circuit

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
notation

186
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,000
so let's take this yar construction here

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
and now could we add some pre-processing

188
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
function here in front so that we could

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,199
have some short input x then do some

190
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
pre-processing to it maybe

191
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,759
i don't know something that yields maybe

192
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,880
pairwise independent uh xi's here or

193
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
something

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
and then

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
only after this pre-processing

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
pass these inputs uh to the layer with

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
one-way function calls and then we could

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,919
return these

199
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
so we are interested in whether this

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
kind of g

201
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
would be possible

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,759
in particular if these inputs to the

203
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
weak one-way function are of length m

204
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
and uh the input to the whole strong

205
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
one-way function was of length n

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
then it would be cool if we could get

207
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
n equals some constant times m so only

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,639
linear blow up

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
in the input length to the

210
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,000
strong one-way function g

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
would be nice

212
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,520
so then g would be security preserving

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,840
now

214
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
the result of our paper is unfortunately

215
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,199
negative

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
so

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,719
no you cannot have

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,039
short input here

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
and

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
how bad exactly is the situation

221
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,479
so

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
we show

223
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,760
that

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
there exists

225
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
no

226
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
pre-processing function

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
no pre-processing

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
with

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
uh input length n

230
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
less than or equal to constant

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
times

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,800
p of n

233
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
where p was uh

234
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,600
the

235
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
polynomial related to the

236
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,480
weak one-way function so if our weak

237
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
one-way function is p-weak

238
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
then

239
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,279
the pre-processing must have input which

240
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
is longer than constant times this

241
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,839
polynomial of of this n

242
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,240
that is

243
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
in other words

244
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
we show that

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
you

246
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
cannot

247
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
prove

248
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,120
that

249
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,160
g

250
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,120
which

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,120
uses such a short input pre-processing

252
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
is

253
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
a

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,320
strong

255
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,279
one-way function

256
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,839
and what exactly do we rule out

257
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
we rule out

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,360
uh black box pools

259
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
so you cannot prove in a black box

260
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
manner that

261
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
g is a strong one function if it has

262
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,399
such a short input pre-processing

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,360
and black box with respect to what

264
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,640
well uh it should treat this f

265
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
as a black box so it is allowed to know

266
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,160
this inversion probability p

267
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,079
but otherwise uh

268
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,760
g should be completely black box

269
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
with respect to f

270
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
and additionally

271
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,839
the proof should be relativizing

272
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
in particular

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,880
we would rule out the proof of this uh

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
yahoo theorem so that proof is

275
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,480
black box and relativising

276
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
by our definitions so even though that

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,399
proof uses

278
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,480
uh this kind of lp

279
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,440
uh

280
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
we still say that it's black box because

281
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
otherwise it treats as a black box

282
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
but before i go to the proof

283
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,320
let's look at what is still open so what

284
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
what

285
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
we don't prove in the paper

286
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
well

287
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,880
we only look at constructions that look

288
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
like this

289
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
so there is some

290
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,760
eggs then some pre-processing and then

291
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
this layer of

292
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,839
function calls

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
but what if we want to generalize this

294
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
to all

295
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
non-adaptive constructions

296
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,079
so in general

297
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
and non-adaptive construction might also

298
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,480
additionally have some post-processing

299
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
and it might also use in the

300
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
post-processing layer

301
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,720
some additional data

302
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
let's call it d

303
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
which is not passed uh through the

304
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,160
f calls

305
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,279
now

306
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,360
what do we say about general

307
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
non-adaptive constructions

308
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
so constructions that look like this

309
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
well

310
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,000
first

311
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
if this post-processing is almost

312
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
injective

313
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
so

314
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
uh if i'm given this z

315
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,720
and i can then guess

316
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
all these y's

317
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,639
with no negligible probability then our

318
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
proof still holds

319
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,160
so

320
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,360
uh the same negative result holds

321
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
for any almost injected post-processing

322
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
function

323
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
but

324
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
what is still open

325
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
is if we have some compressing

326
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
post-processing

327
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
for example

328
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
this post-processing

329
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
could be

330
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
xor

331
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
of all these y values

332
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,519
so if we just take a bitwise xor of

333
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
these y's

334
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,600
as this post-processing

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,240
then it is highly compressing you cannot

336
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
guess these y's given only the value z

337
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,880
and

338
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,079
in that case we don't know

339
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,040
then we don't have a result

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,480
okay

341
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
and

342
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
then of course

343
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
this takes care of all non-adaptive

344
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
cases

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,079
but

346
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,720
what if we allow g to be adaptive

347
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,680
maybe

348
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,079
we only care about whether the input to

349
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
g is short but we don't care about

350
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
really what the construction looks like

351
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,360
well in that case there actually is a

352
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
positive result

353
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,959

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,920
from fox 1990

356
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
and there they show that

357
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,839
if

358
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,519
if the weak one-way function is regular

359
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,880
then

360
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
uh there exists a short input strong

361
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
one-way function construction d

362
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
and

363
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,560
uh their proof is uh

364
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,519
quite

365
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,560
nice

366
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,320
so uh their g looks like this

367
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
it takes some uh short input x

368
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,279
and uh then some set of indices i one

369
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
let's say i want to i

370
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
k

371
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,760
and then

372
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
they pass this

373
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
input x

374
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
into the weak one-way function

375
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,519
and get some output y

376
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,880
and now

377
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,760
if this f is length preserving

378
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
we can think of the inputs to the weak

379
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
one-way function and the outputs to the

380
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
weak one-way functions

381
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
uh as

382
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
nodes in some expander graph

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,040
so

384
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
now we also have some

385
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
big expander graph that has equally many

386
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
nodes as how many bit strings there are

387
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,959
of uh

388
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
of this length

389
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,680
and

390
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
once we get this output y

391
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
uh we interpret it

392
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
as

393
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
some node

394
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,920
here in the expander

395
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,720
and then we take the first index here

396
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
and

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,279
we move

398
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,160
and we take this i

399
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,279
edge

400
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,040
on the expander from that node y

401
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,160
and then we end up in uh in some other

402
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
node let's call it y

403
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
prime

404
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,759
and

405
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
then we put this y prime again in this

406
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
weak one-way function and get some y

407
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
prime prime and then we again

408
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,160
interpret the y prime prime

409
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
as some node in the expander and then we

410
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
take the next index

411
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
and take another step in the expander

412
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,360
and again put it to the weak one-way

413
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,000
function and so on alternating steps in

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
the expander and weak one-way function

415
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
calls

416
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
however

417
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,199
there is a small caveat

418
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,480
namely

419
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
this only works

420
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,320
if the regularity parameter of f is

421
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
normal

422
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,320
and to overcome that

423
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
more recently in 2006

424
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
haydn harnick and heingold

425
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
show that you can change these expander

426
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
calls

427
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,279
into hash function calls

428
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,399
so

429
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,440
they

430
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
uh again have a regular

431
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
weak one-way function f

432
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
and then they construct a g that takes

433
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,839
some short input x and uh some hash

434
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,839
functions

435
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,679
h1 h2

436
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,559
2 let's say

437
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
h k

438
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
and now

439
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,119
we again pass this

440
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,799
x into the weak one-way function

441
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,480
but now

442
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
uh instead of using this exponder

443
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we use the first hash function so we put

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
the output here into the hash function

445
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
h1

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
and then we again make a weak one-way

447
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,080
function call

448
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,440
and then we take the next hash function

449
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,200
h2 and so on alternating calls

450
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,720
between weak one-way function f and

451
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
the hash functions h

452
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
this is also known as the randomized

453
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,200
iterative

454
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
and now again we get a strong one-way

455
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
function from weak one-way function but

456
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
now this weak one-way function is

457
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,640
allowed to be arbitrary regular weak

458
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
one-way function

459
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,000
so now we don't need to know

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,960
the regularity

461
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,960
parameter okay

462
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
so here is the big picture

463
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
so

464
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
we rule out

465
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,039
non-adaptive constructions where the

466
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,600
post-processing is almost

467
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
injective

468
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,480
but we don't say anything about

469
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,640
compressing post-processing

470
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,760
or

471
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,799
adaptive constructions

472
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,679
now

473
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
you might wonder how our result is

474
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,919
related to the paper from 2013

475
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,080
barriers in cryptography with weak

476
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,760
correlated and leaked sources by these

477
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
it turns out that we are not actually

478
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,080
studying the same question

479
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
but the setting looks very similar so

480
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
let me quickly lay out the differences

481
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
before we go to our proof

482
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,760
in this paper

483
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,000
and our paper

484
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,720
we both rule out some

485
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
black box proofs

486
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,039
vixx is interested in the case

487
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,840
where we have some

488
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
direct product construction like this

489
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
where we concatenate multiple calls

490
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
to some function f

491
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,600
and

492
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
now it's like the yaw construction but

493
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,679
the inputs to this g come from some

494
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,440
correlated source

495
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,600
leaks shows

496
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,760
that

497
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,720
there is

498
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,160
a particular

499
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
correlated source

500
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
that they present in the paper

501
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
for which no matter what this function f

502
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
is

503
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,840
as long as it's some efficient

504
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,919
function such a g cannot be a strong

505
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,640
one-way function

506
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
while in our paper

507
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
we are interested in a different

508
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
question

509
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
so

510
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
we show that

511
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
there exists

512
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
some weak one-way function f

513
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
for which no matter what this

514
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
preprocessing function is as long as it

515
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,320
has a short input

516
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,159
this g is not a strong one-way function

517
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,039
so

518
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,480
we rule out

519
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,440
all possible pre-processings

520
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,600
with short inputs

521
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,919
while vix rules out all possible

522
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,120
efficient functions f

523
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,600
when the inputs are correlated

524
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
in

525
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
in certain way

526
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,799
so in our proof

527
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,480
uh this is

528
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,080
black box with respect to the adversary

529
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
and

530
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,000
uh the proofs that we rule out are black

531
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,039
box

532
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,080
in the

533
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,559
weak one-way function f

534
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,520
while in vicks paper

535
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
the

536
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
proofs are black box with respect to

537
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,799
adversary and the correlated source

538
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
i hope this clarifies the differences

539
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
between these two papers

540
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,720
and

541
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,360
then

542
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,799
to the fun part

543
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,918
let's go to the proof

544
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,679
similar to the impugnatzo hoodie

545
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,440
89

546
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
result

547
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,360
we

548
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
introduced some oracles

549
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,600
and

550
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
what kind of oracles we introduce so

551
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,039
first we introduced

552
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,240
the

553
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,799
b space oracle

554
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,600
to get rid of all possibly already

555
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,159
existing one by functions

556
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
and then we add uh

557
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
something that acts as a weak one-way

558
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,640
function

559
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,360
namely we add

560
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,439
a random permutation oracle

561
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,679
random

562
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,400
uh but now there is a problem because a

563
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
random permutation oracle is already a

564
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
strong one-way function

565
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,520
so now we need to somehow make this

566
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
a weak one-way function

567
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,520
and how do we do that

568
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,640
well we simply add another oracle

569
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,200
called in for inverting

570
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,320
which will invert our

571
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,520
function

572
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,039
if

573
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,640
so this

574
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
inverts

575
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,840
a

576
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,559
random

577
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,960
subset

578
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,559
of

579
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,400
the

580
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
function if

581
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,679
this functions

582
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,240
outputs

583
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,679
all right

584
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,720
and uh what kind of a random subset of

585
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
uh these functions outputs we want to

586
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
invert

587
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
well

588
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,919
uh in order for f to be a weak one-way

589
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,200
function

590
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,840
this random

591
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,200
subset uh

592
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
let's call it

593
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
the easy set

594
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,880
so

595
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
things that are easy to invert

596
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,720
uh the easy set should be of size

597
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,760
uh

598
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,039
one minus one over the polynomial p of m

599
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
so this fraction of

600
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
all the inputs

601
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,240
and

602
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
if we invert this

603
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,200
this big fraction of all the inputs

604
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
of all the outputs

605
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,640
of f

606
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,159
then uh

607
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,760
this becomes a weak one-way function

608
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
instead of a strong one-way function

609
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,679
so now

610
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,000
if is

611
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
a p-weak one-way function

612
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,520
so this part should be

613
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
should be easy to prove

614
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,559
and now the

615
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,360
non-trivial part of the proof is to show

616
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
that

617
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
g

618
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,679
is still

619
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
that we cannot have a strong one-way

620
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,720
function

621
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,240
that looks like this

622
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,720
so uh

623
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
now what is left to prove here is that

624
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
relative to these oracles

625
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
uh

626
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,320
all

627
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,880
functions g

628
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,679
that

629
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,679
look like this

630
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,760
where

631
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
this input x

632
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,080
is of length

633
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,200
uh

634
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,919
less than some epsilon times

635
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,880
p of n

636
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,720
let's call this number n

637
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,880
and uh where

638
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
these are offline

639
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,279
in

640
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,039
so all g that look like this

641
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,000
can be inverted with non-negligible

642
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
probability

643
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,960
and

644
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
uh in particular

645
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,679
now this pre-processing function

646
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
should also not make calls to the

647
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,080
inversion oracle

648
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,240
so

649
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,480
this pre-processing function can be

650
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
anything but it should not make

651
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,360
oracle calls to end it can make oracle

652
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,320
calls to fee space that's fine but no

653
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,000
calls to the inversion oracle

654
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
since we restrict g in this way we will

655
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
only rule out proofs

656
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,279
reduction proofs

657
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,159
where

658
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,600
the reduction uses the adversary against

659
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,400
g

660
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
as black box

661
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,440
and this is for example the case

662
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
in the yaw proof

663
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
and uh this is how we usually do it so

664
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,960
the adversary against g

665
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
uh

666
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,960
might even be inefficient and still the

667
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,960
reduction uh should work

668
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,080
and as it uses this adversary just as a

669
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
black box

670
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
so we uh only rule out

671
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,320
uh

672
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,960
black box proofs that are black box uh

673
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,440
with respect to f and with respect to

674
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,919
the adversary to be precise

675
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,640
and see the paper for more details or

676
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,679
ask me afterwards

677
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,840
cool

678
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,720
uh

679
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,640
okay so now we should show that

680
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,679
such a

681
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
short input g

682
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,039
uh

683
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,360
can always be inverted with

684
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,799
non-negligible probability

685
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,840
okay

686
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,400
so first observation that we can make

687
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,919
here

688
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,400
is that

689
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
if

690
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
l

691
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
so the number of calls we make here

692
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,240
if l is

693
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,880
less than or equal to this polynomial p

694
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
of n

695
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,159
then

696
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,440
the

697
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,159
probability

698
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,760
uh that

699
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,559
all of these y calls

700
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
all y i

701
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,880
are in the easy set

702
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
so

703
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,799
in this set that the inversion oracle

704
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,279
inverts

705
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,760
so the probability that all of these y's

706
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,399
are in the easy set

707
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,840
uh

708
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,480
and now i say probability over the

709
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,120
choice of this random permutation oracle

710
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,559
and here

711
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,080
when i say over if

712
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
i mean the sampling of if

713
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,559
and the sampling of the easy set so i

714
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,640
always think of the easy set as part of

715
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,240
f

716
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,919
and over the choice of x this input to

717
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,080
the

718
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,559
strong one-way function g

719
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,279
so this probability what is it

720
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,720
well

721
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,399
uh

722
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,799
this is

723
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
more or equal to

724
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
1 minus 1 over poly

725
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
uh p

726
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,200
so this is the probability that one of

727
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,559
these things

728
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
is in the easy set and well now we have

729
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,880
l of them but l is less than p of n

730
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,679
so

731
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,240
uh the overall probability probability

732
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
that all of them are easy

733
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,559
is uh

734
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
more or equal to

735
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,200
this one minus one over p to the

736
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
polynomial p

737
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,360
because

738
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,039
there are

739
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,679
at most uh p many of

740
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,880
these

741
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,039
y's

742
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,000
and

743
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
now this thing here

744
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,559
is a constant

745
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,440
so

746
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
uh

747
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,640
this uh

748
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,399
goes to

749
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,960
e to the minus one uh

750
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,120
and

751
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,080
and

752
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
hence we can see that

753
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,799
already when whenever p is bigger than

754
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
two or something

755
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,919
this is more than

756
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,880
1 over 4.

757
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,520
so

758
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
with

759
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,039
constant probability

760
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,399
all of the y's will be easy

761
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,360
when

762
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
when this

763
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,840
l is

764
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,480
small enough

765
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,880
and

766
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,240
from

767
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,520
that it follows that

768
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,440
that if if that happens if all of them

769
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,039
are easy well

770
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,960
then we have actually an adversary

771
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,399
against g

772
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,960
so then our adversary can just invert

773
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,360
all of the y's one by one and get this

774
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,960
string of x

775
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,520
and then it can use p space oracle

776
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,559
to find one fitting pre-image

777
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,440
of the pre-processing for those x when

778
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,799
when the adversary knows all of the x's

779
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,159
so in that case inverting is easy

780
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,960
we can surely find a pre-image

781
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
using the p-space oracle

782
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
so without loss of generality

783
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,039
uh

784
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,440
we can assume

785
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,919
that

786
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,000
l is bigger than uh p of m because if

787
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,399
it's uh smaller than with constant

788
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,159
probability

789
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,840
uh g is very easy to convert

790
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,720
okay

791
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
so now we know that this g

792
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,519
should have a short input and it it

793
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
should have many uh calls to this weak

794
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,200
one-way function f

795
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,000
cool um

796
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,679
and now

797
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,399
uh second observation

798
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,519
is that

799
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,360
uh

800
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,320
with

801
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,960
high probability

802
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,640
1 minus 1 over p

803
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
fraction

804
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,640
of

805
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,640
these y i's

806
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,840
are

807
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,320
easy

808
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
so if we look at the probability over

809
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,760
the choice of f

810
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,039
and over

811
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,440
over the choice of x

812
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
then the easy set

813
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,919
was chosen so that

814
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,720
it's a random subset of of this size

815
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,559
then it means that

816
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,399
whether

817
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,760
some particular y i is easy or not

818
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,399
follows the binomial distribution with

819
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,559
uh this kind of weight

820
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,559
so this is the probability that an

821
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,279
individual wire is easy

822
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,240
and hence the expected value is

823
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,320
expected number of y i's

824
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
in any

825
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,120
any output

826
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,240
that are easy is is this fraction

827
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,080
and now with probability one-half

828
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,960
indeed we reach at least that many easy

829
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,519
values

830
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
okay

831
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,279
so now we know that uh

832
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,760
we can kind of trust that there are

833
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
at least this fraction of easy easy-wise

834
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,480
so with constant probability this holds

835
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,000
and now we get to our main observation

836
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,480
so

837
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
when there are

838
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,399
uh

839
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,240
this many easy y's

840
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,000
the remaining

841
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,880
uh

842
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,559
hard x's

843
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,519
so

844
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,760
so suppose we have this many easy y's

845
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,279
and then we invert them using the

846
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,960
inversion oracle

847
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
then the remaining hard x's

848
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,519
have little entropy of their own

849
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,559
in expectation

850
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,440
uh so let's write this more precisely

851
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,519
what our theorem says

852
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,679
so

853
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,440
so now

854
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,559
the

855
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,960
expectation

856
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,840
of

857
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,320
shannon entropy

858
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,840
of

859
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,720
x let's take some permutation pi and

860
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,200
this expectation is now now over the

861
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
permutation pi so we take some

862
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,799
permutation of the

863
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,719
x values so x1

864
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
and now

865
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,000
since there are this fraction of easy

866
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,119
values

867
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,399
there is

868
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,359
this one over poly p fraction of heart

869
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,719
values

870
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,399
so we take the

871
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,199
entropy of the heart values

872
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
so

873
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,918
pi of

874
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,918
1 over poly times l

875
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,560
so what is the entropy

876
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,679
of

877
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,639
these

878
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,719
heart values

879
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,520
condition that we know

880
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,560
uh

881
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,839
all the rest

882
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,639
so

883
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,839
pi

884
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,280
one over t

885
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,800
l plus one

886
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,520
up to

887
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,520
x

888
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,560
pi of l

889
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
so this

890
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
expectation

891
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,480
of the entropy of

892
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,520
uh

893
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,800
hard excise when we know the rest of the

894
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,480
excise so the easy ones

895
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,880
this is on expectation less than n

896
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
over

897
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,599
this polynomial p of n

898
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
and now

899
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,320
uh

900
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,320
since uh this n was some epsilon times p

901
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
of n

902
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,680
so this is

903
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,440
epsilon times p of n

904
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
uh

905
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
we get that

906
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
uh

907
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,000
this expectation

908
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,680
is

909
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
is this epsilon

910
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,480
so in expectation

911
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,880
uh the hard excise

912
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,880
have only epsilon much so some

913
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
small constant

914
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,960
of our choice

915
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,040
some small constant number of entropy

916
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,440
and uh this entropy was over over the

917
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,720
choice of x

918
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,240
and since shannon entropy is always more

919
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,359
or equal to the mean entropy or the

920
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,200
guessing entropy

921
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,359
it means that

922
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,400
it is easy to guess

923
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,520
these

924
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,760
hard values

925
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
because they don't have

926
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
much entropy if we have only constant

927
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,240
constant bits of entropy

928
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,200
then

929
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
you can guess these

930
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
with high probability

931
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,880
and now if you can guess them correctly

932
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,240
then again we are in the situation when

933
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,079
we know all the x's and then you can

934
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,200
just use p space oracle to get back uh

935
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,680
the x here

936
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
perfect

937
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
so this is our main

938
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,040
main observation

939
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,560
and

940
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,400
uh

941
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,079
let's

942
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,160
prove this

943
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,000
so

944
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,640
in particular let's put this inequality

945
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,920
here

946
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
so why

947
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,720
uh do we have only little entropy left

948
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,800
for these xi's

949
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
so we don't know what this preprocessing

950
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,560
function is

951
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,359
but

952
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,520
for some reason

953
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,680
there cannot be

954
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,440
much entropy left for

955
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,079
for

956
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,079
for these hard hard axes

957
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
first

958
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
let's

959
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,560
divide these

960
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,160
uh x values into blocks so what do i

961
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,359
mean by that

962
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,599
we have these uh

963
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,040
x

964
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,720
uh if we have some fixed permutation pi

965
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
then um all of our x x's can be divided

966
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,480
into like x pi 1

967
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,079
x

968
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,280
pi

969
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,400
1 over t

970
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,799
l

971
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
and

972
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,800
x

973
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,880
pi

974
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,640
l over p plus 1

975
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,079
etc until x

976
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,119
by

977
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,720
l

978
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,240
and

979
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,560
now

980
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,920
uh let's divide these into blocks so

981
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,280
this would be the first block

982
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,160
so

983
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,359
block

984
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,839
of

985
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,880
size

986
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,760
l over p

987
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,760
and uh just for convenience of notation

988
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,440
uh let's denote uh this first block

989
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,000
let's define this as

990
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,599
b

991
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,400
pi

992
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,200
1 and then the second block of

993
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
size l over p

994
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,119
would be

995
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,760
b

996
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,359
2

997
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,599
pi etc

998
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,160
so in total we would have here

999
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,960
p

1000
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,920
blocks

1001
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,680
b

1002
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,839
pi

1003
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,320
one

1004
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
up to

1005
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,280
b

1006
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,040
p

1007
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,200
pi

1008
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,280
okay so

1009
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
now we have

1010
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,160
uh divided uh all of our x

1011
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,680
into blocks of size l over p so this is

1012
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,359
the size of uh

1013
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,200
the heart

1014
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,640
how many heart values we have in

1015
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,119
expectation

1016
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,079
and now

1017
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
uh

1018
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,440
we are interested in this

1019
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
uh

1020
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
expectation of entropy

1021
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,000
and to get close to it let's write this

1022
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
sum

1023
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,200
of

1024
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,640
the expectation of a pi

1025
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,520
of

1026
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,119
this entropy

1027
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,119
of

1028
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
of

1029
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,440
some j block

1030
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
uh conditions that we know all the

1031
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
blocks that come after j

1032
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,400
so

1033
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,440
j plus one pi

1034
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
uh etc until the last one so the

1035
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,000
eighth block

1036
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,200
and uh the sun

1037
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,680
we would let j go from one uh to p so

1038
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,799
over all of these blocks

1039
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,640
right and uh the reason why we look at

1040
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,280
this sum in particular even though we

1041
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,079
are only interested in the entropy of

1042
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,520
the first block given all the rest

1043
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
uh we look at this sum where we have

1044
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
some of these like additional

1045
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
uh

1046
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,720
additional entropies

1047
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,400
we look at the sum because then we can

1048
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,960
use the chain rule so let's see how that

1049
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,119
goes

1050
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,079
well

1051
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,680
first by linearity of expectation

1052
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,280
we can put this

1053
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,720
sum inside the expectation so now we get

1054
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,280
expectation over pi

1055
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,040
of

1056
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,040
the sum where j goes from one to p

1057
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,359
of whatever was here

1058
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,680
before

1059
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,040
all right

1060
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,680
so this is just a linearity of

1061
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,399
excavation

1062
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,000
and now

1063
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,520
we can use

1064
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
chain rule of shannon entropy and this

1065
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,200
is exactly the reason

1066
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,599
why we use shannon entropy here and not

1067
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,440
mean and mean entropy directly

1068
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,359
is that now we can

1069
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,960
we can use chain rule

1070
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,599
so this is now

1071
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,200
just the entropy of

1072
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,240
b

1073
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
uh

1074
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,599
1

1075
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,280
pi

1076
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,319
2

1077
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,520
b

1078
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,760
5 so this is

1079
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,599
by

1080
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,960
chain rule

1081
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
uh

1082
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
this sum of entropies is just the

1083
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,119
entropy of all the books

1084
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,160
well

1085
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,240
now we know that the entropy of all the

1086
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,640
blocks

1087
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,160
uh is the entropy of all of these x

1088
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
values

1089
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,880
and now uh what is the entropy of all of

1090
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,359
these x values well all of these x

1091
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,760
values come from some x

1092
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,280
and this x of length n so these x's

1093
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,720
together can have only at most n bits of

1094
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
entropy

1095
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,480
so

1096
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,520
now

1097
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,200
this entropy here

1098
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,839
is upper bounded by n

1099
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,240
uh

1100
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
because it's

1101
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,800
well

1102
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,640
it's upper bounded by the entropy of x

1103
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,160
which which we know is m

1104
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,640
great

1105
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,599
so now we have an upper bound

1106
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,319
uh for this summation here

1107
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,079
let's uh

1108
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,079
write it down again so we know that n is

1109
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,800
more or equal to

1110
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,040
this summation

1111
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,160
we know that entropy of

1112
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,480
something

1113
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,560
uh

1114
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,920
is

1115
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
here here we have uh entropy of the j

1116
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,720
block conditioned on the entropy of all

1117
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,680
the all the blocks that come after it

1118
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,640
well this entropy is certainly

1119
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,400
uh

1120
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,520
certainly more or equal to the entropy

1121
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,040
of the jadewalk

1122
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,240
uh conditioned on all the other blocks

1123
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
so now we only have the blocks that come

1124
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
after j but if we also additionally add

1125
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,000
the blocks that come before j

1126
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,839
so b one

1127
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,839
pi

1128
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,400
be

1129
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,319
j minus one

1130
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,920
pi

1131
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,880
and uh then the blocks that come after

1132
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,160
so the

1133
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,119
j plus one

1134
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,839
until

1135
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,880
until

1136
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
the

1137
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,000
t

1138
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,760
high

1139
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,839
so certainly uh if we condition more

1140
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,078
things the entropy can only decrease

1141
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,160
this is

1142
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,200
more equal to

1143
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,440
the summation

1144
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,839
and

1145
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,040
this whole thing here

1146
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,640
and

1147
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,040
now if we look at this

1148
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,880
uh expectation here so expectation of

1149
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,079
one block

1150
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,440
given all the other blocks

1151
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,640
and this is expectation over pi so

1152
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,880
expectation over the permutation

1153
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
so in particular here we are looking at

1154
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,960
the expectation

1155
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,680
of

1156
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,200
one block

1157
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,160
conditioned on all the other groups

1158
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,599
and the expectation is over the

1159
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,079
permutation and the permutation goes

1160
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,560
through all possible permutations so in

1161
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,640
particular it also goes through the

1162
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,079
permutation where j

1163
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,200
is

1164
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,680
the first problem

1165
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,720
so now actually we can simplify this and

1166
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,040
uh write this as

1167
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,119
expectation over some pi prime

1168
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,800
and this pi prime is just some

1169
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,960
reordering of the permutations here but

1170
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,319
the order doesn't matter in the

1171
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,480
expectation

1172
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,640
so

1173
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,760
so we could as well write expectation of

1174
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:53,920
the

1175
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,040

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,280
until

1185
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,160

prime

1188
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,200
or some other permutation pi but since

1189
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,880
this permutation goes through all of

1190
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,040
them like this one it doesn't really

1191
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,280
matter uh

1192
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,599
what the j is we anyway

1193
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,680
uh reach that also so this thing goes

1194
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,440
through all the possible permutations uh

1195
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,160
and uh this thing as well but this is

1196
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,920
just uh simpler to write

1197
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,640
and now we notice that this actually

1198
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,920
doesn't depend on the j anymore because

1199
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,160
uh

1200
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,319
it is it is completely arbitrary what we

1201
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,240
consider as the first book

1202
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,680
while we anyway go through all the

1203
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,680
permutations

1204
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,040
so

1205
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,599
this whole thing

1206
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,400
where we sum over j

1207
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,359
uh

1208
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,440
we just sum uh the same thing uh p many

1209
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,760
times so we get p times

1210
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,960
this expectation

1211
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,480
uh

1212
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,240
but now

1213
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,960
this is actually what we wanted so now

1214
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,160
we have that the expectation of entropy

1215
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,240
of the first block condition that we

1216
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,960
know the rest of the blocks

1217
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
uh

1218
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,880
this entropy is less than or equal to n

1219
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,760
uh

1220
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,640
divided by p

1221
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,400
and

1222
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,119
this is exactly what our theorem says so

1223
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,319
expectation of entropy of the first four

1224
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,480
conditions that we know over other

1225
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,599
blocks

1226
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,839
is less than n over

1227
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,799
the polynomial p

1228
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,279
and now

1229
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,200
this post statement

1230
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,119
right

1231
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,240
the high level intuition of this proof

1232
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,520
is

1233
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,440
that since

1234
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,559
g

1235
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
has to divide the randomness of x

1236
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,559
between many calls of f

1237
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,640
and g does not know which of them are

1238
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,599
hard

1239
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,000
it is very likely that the heart values

1240
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,559
have little entropy conditioned on the

1241
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,559
easy values

1242
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,400
now this is of course just the

1243
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,880
expectation so we still need to do some

1244
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,119
averaging argument to say that the

1245
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,480
adversary can indeed invert g

1246
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,640
with high probability

1247
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,079
but uh this is the main observation

1248
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,839
uh that yields it eventually

1249
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,839
okay

1250
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,200
so

1251
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,920
this is it

1252
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,599
thank you for watching

1253
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,839
bye
