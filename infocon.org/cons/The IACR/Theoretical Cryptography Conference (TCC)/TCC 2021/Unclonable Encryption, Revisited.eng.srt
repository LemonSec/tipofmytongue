00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,880
hello my name is fatih welcome to my

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,240
presentation of unclonable encryption

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,760
revisited

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,480
which is joint work with prabhanjan

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,960
anand

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
unclonable cryptography

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,359
is a hot field in quantum cryptography

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
which relies on

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,519
the no cloning theorem

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
no cloning theorem states that there is

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
no universal cloner of quantum states

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,520
in particular it states that

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,120
any cloner

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,640
can clone

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
a set of states which are mutually

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,399
orthogonal

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,640
assuming this cloner is exact

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,079
clearly this concept has no classical

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,600
counterpart

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,239
any classical bit of information can be

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,520
indefinitely copied

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
there are several

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
unclonable primitives

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,650
that are based on the noclonic theorem

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,159
[Music]

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
quantum money

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
is a primitive

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
in which quantum states are used as

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,799
banknotes

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
and they cannot be

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
cloned to make more money without the

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,320
bank's permission

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,479
introduced by scott aronson

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,840
copy protection is a primitive

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
that protects against

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,360
software piracy

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
signature tokens

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
allow you to sign messages only once

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
given a quantum state

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,439
which means it has to be unclonable

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,600
likewise in single decrypter encryption

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
there is a decryption key

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
which cannot be used more than once

44
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,559
for the decryption functionality

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,840
and finally unclonable encryption which

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,160
is the topic of today's talk

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
introduced by broadband and lord

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
is a primitive

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
where cipher texts are cannot be cloned

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
in a way that preserves

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
the functionality of

52
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,959
being decrypted into the original

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,360
message

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
in this context we're considering this

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
setting where

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
we're encrypting classical messages

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,599
using quantum algorithms and thereby

58
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,679
having quantum ciphertexts

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,760
so how do we define

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,599
unclonability

61
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
in this setting it is defined by a

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
security experiment which we will call

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,040
the cloning experiment

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
and the maximum

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
attainable success probability in this

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,360
experiment

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
by a polynomial time triplet adversary

68
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,680
which i will refer to as alice bob and

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
charlie

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,280
will give us the

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
security parameter

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,159
as it relates to unclonability

73
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,879
the glowing experiment consists of two

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,480
phases

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
in the first phase

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
the challenger

77
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
creates encryption of a random message

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,519
and sends it to alice

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,640
and then alice applies a quantum channel

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,519
to split the ciphertext between

81
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
two physically distant registers which

82
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
belong to bob and charlie

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,720
the second phase is the challenge phase

84
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,879
in which bob and charlie are not allowed

85
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,519
to communicate

86
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
after learning the key from the

87
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,959
challenger

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,680
bob and charlie need to both guess the

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
message correctly

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,159
this captures

91
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
the intuition that

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,319
they both preserve the decryption

93
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
functionality simultaneously

94
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,040
note that you can always trivially send

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
the ciphertext to one of the parties

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
say bob and then have charlie guess the

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,959
message uniformly at random which would

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
give us a success probability of 1 over

99
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
2 to the n

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
so that will be the benchmark to compare

101
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
success probabilities with

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
in their introductory work broadband and

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,199
lord

104
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
presented two constructions of

105
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
unclonable encryption

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
the first one which they call conjugate

107
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,040
encryption

108
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,000
is based on the conjugate coding by

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
weissner

110
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,479
which are the bb-84 states

111
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
used in

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
weisner's quantum money construction as

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,199
well as quantum key distribution

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,720
the security

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,199
for this scheme is information theoretic

116
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
and it it matches the value 0.85 to the

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
end which comes from

118
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,479
a monogamy of entanglement bound

119
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,560
they also

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,240
show a modification using prfs which

121
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
achieves a better security

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
but only in the quantum random oracle

123
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,360
model

124
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,199
in this work we explore different ways

125
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,639
to improve

126
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
on this introductory work on unclonable

127
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,919
encryption here are some of the open

128
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
directions left by the authors to

129
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
explore

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,960
can we make the key reusable

131
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
without

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,240
resorting to the random oracle model

133
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
can we

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,919
make the encryption in the public key

135
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
setting

136
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,880
can we achieve security close to 0.5 to

137
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,080
the n

138
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,360
which matches the trivial attack

139
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
and can we use this unclonable

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,759
encryption primitive

141
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,560
to

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,520
construct other unclonable crypto

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
or show implications in the other

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
direction

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
we answer three out of the four

146
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
questions positively in this paper

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,639
and

148
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,919
we

149
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,360
make some observations and show negative

150
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,840
results about the existing constructions

151
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,919
uh regarding the security

152
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,400
our first contribution

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,160
is about the reusability of the key

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
the information theory the construction

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
of broadband and lord

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,319
did not allow the key to be reused

157
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
due to a one-time path

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,560
in the encryption

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
so

160
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,160
assuming post-quantum one-way functions

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
we present the construction which is

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
secure under multi-message attacks

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,280
likewise we also present a scheme in the

164
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
public key setting

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,840
which is semantically

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,080
secure again this construction is based

167
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,240
on minimal possible assumptions

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
there are different reasons we care

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
about reusability of the key

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
one is

171
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
efficiency we don't want to have to

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
create a new key

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
for each

174
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,599
bit of communication

175
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
secondly all the benefits of public key

176
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
crypto in the classical world still

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
apply to the case of unclonable

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,080
encryption

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,319
with the additional requirement that we

180
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,520
might be in a setting where

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
unclonability is desired

182
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
this motivates our second construction

183
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
which is in the public key setting

184
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,919
thirdly

185
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,639
in case we use unclonable encryption to

186
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
construct other primitives

187
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,680
we might need reusability of the key in

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
security proofs

189
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,960
it is important to note that in our work

190
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
we do not consider the issue of

191
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,400
reusability

192
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,520
as it pertains to unclonable security we

193
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,639
only

194
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,479
take it into account in semantic

195
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,199
security this is not a big problem in

196
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
the public key setting since the

197
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,800
adversary can generate ciphertexts

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
himself however in the private key

199
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,599
setting

200
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,958
a more delicate argument might be needed

201
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,159
here's a table that summarizes

202
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,680
the increment of our constructions

203
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
which is that they satisfy somatic

204
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
security without having to use

205
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
random oracle model

206
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,920
next we explore whether the

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,279
0.85 to the end on cloneable security is

208
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
tight for the conjugate encryption

209
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
it turns out it is tight in the sense

210
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
that it cannot be arbitrarily close to

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
0.5 to the end due to

212
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,720
a universal cloning attack which we

213
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
present

214
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
one way to potentially get closer to

215
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
0.5 to the n

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
is to find the harder monogamy of

217
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
entanglement game and base

218
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
the construction on that game

219
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
we show that the use of weisner bases

220
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,360
can be generalized to include a larger

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,240
class of bases and the corresponding

222
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
monogamy of entanglement games

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,120
and such bases and such monogamy games

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,800
have been analyzed

225
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,120
one example is coset states

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
our final contribution is to show an

227
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,320
implication from unclonable encryption

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,519
to copy protection

229
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,320
a copy protection scheme is a tuple of

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
algorithms copy protect and evaluate

231
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
given a function from a family copy

232
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,360
protect outputs a copy protected quantum

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,560
state

234
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,680
and using that quantum state a client

235
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
can evaluate inputs of f

236
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
correctness requires that if this is

237
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
done honestly

238
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,040
the output should be equal to f of x

239
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
and security requires that it's

240
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,640
impossible to make two copies of the

241
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
copy protected program

242
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,760
with the same functionality even if

243
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,920
a malicious evaluation algorithm is used

244
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,120
[Music]

245
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
so recall

246
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
the unclonable

247
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
security game

248
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
and

249
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,519
now we will present a stronger version

250
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,760
which was introduced by broadband and

251
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
lord also

252
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
in this version

253
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
the adversary

254
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
gets to choose a pair of messages

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,920
and

256
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
plays a semantic security game

257
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680
where

258
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,800
to vin bob and charlie must

259
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,399
simultaneously distinguish these

260
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
messages

261
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
after the key has been revealed in the

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,760
second phase

263
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,160
note that in this experiment the trivial

264
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
strategy succeeds

265
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
by having charlie guess randomly

266
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
and the probability of success is

267
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,200
one-half

268
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
therefore we call

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
an unclonable encryption scheme

270
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
unclonable indistinguishable secure

271
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
if the optimal

272
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
value of this experiment is negligibly

273
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,800
close to one half

274
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,680
since erinson introduced copy protection

275
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,480
copy protection of point functions has

276
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,279
remained an open problem

277
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,240
airson himself had proposed this scheme

278
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,000
but today today there is no

279
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
formal security proof

280
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,839
in a recent work

281
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
the question was answered positively

282
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
where the security was shown in the

283
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
quantum random oracle model

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
the question in the plane model still

285
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
remains open

286
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
we show that unclonable

287
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
indistinguishable security which was the

288
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
stronger version of unclonable security

289
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,000
can be used to construct copy protection

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
for point functions in the plane model

291
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,680
this result makes the feasibility of

292
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
this stronger primitive

293
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,240
and interesting question

294
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
one limitation of our construction is

295
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,639
that it satisfies a slightly weaker

296
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,079
notion of correctness called

297
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,480
computational correctness which states

298
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,600
that

299
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
polynomial time adverse series will not

300
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
run into inputs that evaluate

301
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,079
incorrectly

302
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,600
all in all

303
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,399
this presents a new direction

304
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
to explore in

305
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
trying to show copy protection of point

306
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,639
functions

307
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,160
let's move on to details

308
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
so

309
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,040
uh we'll first talk about the key

310
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,760
reusability

311
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
in our private key construction

312
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,959
we

313
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,959
make use of hybrid encryption

314
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,880
we take as granted a one-time unclonable

315
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
encryption scheme and the post-content

316
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
private private key encryption scheme

317
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,519
the

318
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
first scheme uh

319
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,199
can be

320
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,760
instantiated by conjugate encryption of

321
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,279
broadband and lord for example

322
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
and the idea is that the

323
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
game best of both worlds for

324
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,040
unclonability comes from the first

325
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,199
scheme and reusability from the second

326
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
one

327
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
the key to our scheme will be the

328
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
private key encryption key and to

329
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
encrypt a message

330
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
we will first generate an unclonable

331
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,639
encryption key

332
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
and encrypt a message using that key

333
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,040
as well as encrypt that key

334
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,800
using the private key encryption key

335
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
the cipher text will be

336
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
the concatenation of these two

337
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,040
ciphertexts one of which is quantum

338
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
it is well known that hybrid encryption

339
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
like this inherits semantic security

340
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,519
from the other layer encryption

341
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,360
pke

342
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
as for

343
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
unclonable security a direct reduction

344
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
unfortunately does not work due to the

345
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
nature of the cloning experiment

346
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
recall that in the second phase of the

347
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
cloning experiment the key is revealed

348
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
which makes it a challenge to invoke the

349
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
semantic security of

350
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,600
pke

351
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
to overcome this issue

352
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,160
we've come up with a property which

353
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,519
makes the encryption non-binding

354
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,320
fakie property states that

355
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
in the eyes of the adversary

356
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
a ciphertext key pair is

357
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
indistinguishable

358
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,040
from another pair where the encrypted

359
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,639
message is zero

360
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,279
and the key is the fake key generated

361
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,079
using the cipher text and the original

362
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,759
message

363
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,120
let's go back to the cloning experiment

364
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
using the fake key properly we will

365
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
slightly modify this experiment to

366
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
overcome our previous issue

367
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
in the next hybrid

368
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,519
we replace m by zero in the first phase

369
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,800
and

370
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
in the second phase instead of revealing

371
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
the original key

372
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
k we reveal the fakey

373
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,000
the fakie property implies that the two

374
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,279
hybrids

375
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,160
do not differ in the adversary's success

376
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
probability except for a negligible

377
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
amount

378
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,040
so that all rem all the remains to show

379
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,079
is

380
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,519
this modified experiment

381
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,399
unlike before the fake key is not alien

382
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,920
to the reduction and it can be generated

383
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,639
when simulating the challenger

384
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,160
therefore

385
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,199
this

386
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,639
uh

387
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,399
finishes the security proof

388
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,480
and in our paper we instantiate this

389
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
fakey property using pseudorandom

390
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,639
functions

391
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,560
we follow the same philosophy in the

392
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
public key setting

393
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,519
however instead of the fakey property we

394
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,240
rely on functional encryption

395
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
and this can be instantiated using

396
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,240
postcondom public key encryption

397
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
which is trivially necessary for public

398
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
key unclonable encryption

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
we also make use of private key

400
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,439
encryption with pseudorandom ciphertexts

401
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,839
and please refer to the manuscript for

402
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
the details

403
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,439
let's move on to our next result

404
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,319
uh before we start let's

405
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,799
let's establish some notation

406
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,439
the weissner basis

407
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,400
uh

408
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
will be denoted by x raised to theta

409
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,360
and

410
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
this means

411
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
for an n bit string theta and x

412
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
how the mark gate will be applied to

413
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,080
certain qubits of x depending on theta

414
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,400
conjugate encryption on clonable

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
security is based on the bb-84 monogamy

416
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,720
game

417
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,760
which we will define now

418
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
it's it's a security game between the

419
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,640
challenger and an adversary which will

420
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,440
denote by bob and charlie the adversary

421
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
starts by preparing a tripartite state

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
and sending one of the registers

423
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
to the challenger

424
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,120
and

425
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,400
we will call n the size of the register

426
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
of the challenger

427
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
and the rest of the state will be

428
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,240
split between bob and charlie

429
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
and in the second phase they're not

430
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
allowed to communicate

431
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,559
and the challenger will measure

432
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,200
its register on a random weisner basis

433
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
indexed by theta

434
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
and the goal is to

435
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,640
predict this measurement outcome

436
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,160
simultaneously as bob and charlie

437
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
based on this conjugate conjugate

438
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
encryption

439
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
encodes the message using a one-time

440
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,400
path

441
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,640
followed by the conjugate encoding

442
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,120
and the conjugate coding provides

443
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,480
unclonable security

444
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,039
which can be reduced to the security of

445
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,280
this monogamy game

446
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
and it has been shown that

447
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
the value of this monogamy game is

448
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,880
exactly 0.85 to the end

449
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,120
and this

450
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,160
value was used as an upper bound on this

451
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
unclaimable security of conjugate

452
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,960
encryption

453
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,559
by the authors

454
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,559
using a reduction in the following form

455
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,360
you prepare an epr state

456
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,039
and apply the splitting map of alice to

457
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,320
the second

458
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,200
half

459
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
and share it across bob and charlie

460
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,600
and this reduction

461
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
works without any security loss due to

462
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
the fact that the pr pair is basis

463
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,559
independent

464
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,679
when the bases in question are

465
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,240
wiser bases

466
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,799
therefore the entanglement does not

467
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,679
break no matter what theta was chosen

468
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,360
we explored

469
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,799
how to generalize this idea and

470
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,919
we

471
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
examined for what bases

472
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,320
this basis independent epr pair

473
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
property still hold

474
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,439
and the answer to that is simple

475
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,120
if we have a collection of bases which

476
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,559
which are linear

477
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
combinations

478
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,520
of the computational basis with real

479
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,000
coefficients

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,480
then it turns out the property holds

481
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
and for any collection of bases like

482
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
that

483
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,120
there is a monogamy game where instead

484
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
of

485
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,000
measuring on a random weisser basis the

486
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,159
challenger will measure

487
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,280
uh

488
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,320
on a random basic basis chosen from this

489
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
collection

490
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
and this results in our construction

491
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,360
which mimics conjugate encryption

492
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,039
except for

493
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,200
uh a general collection of real

494
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
orthogonal bases

495
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
and using the same technique as

496
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,039
broadband and lord we're

497
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
able to show that we can reduce the

498
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,120
security to the monogamy game

499
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,000
therefore this gives us a potential

500
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
venue to explore

501
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
meaningful upper bounds

502
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,559
for unclonable security

503
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,320
on the other hand we can ask the

504
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
question if there are lower bounds for

505
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,480
the existing constructions

506
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
meaning explicit attacks

507
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
and turns out the answer is yes

508
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,640
even though no cloning theorem

509
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,000
rules out exact cloning it turns out

510
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,159
it's still possible to approximately

511
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,120
clone

512
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,720
structured quantum states

513
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
and

514
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
any construction in our generalized

515
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,159
conjugate encryption

516
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,120
um

517
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,400
provided that it encrypts the message

518
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,440
bit wise just like in the original

519
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
conjugate encryption

520
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,440
it is susceptible to

521
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,919
a universal cloning attack

522
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,440
which

523
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
approximately clones every qubit of the

524
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,600
cipher text

525
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
and

526
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,720
has the adversaries

527
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
tried to decrypt the message

528
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,640
as if they had the original ciphertext

529
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
analysis shows that conjugate encryption

530
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,960
is not good enough to achieve optimal

531
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,080
security in this sense

532
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,480
and in general our generalized conjugate

533
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,760
encryption

534
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,799
could only be useful for this purpose

535
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,880
if the bases are sufficiently entangled

536
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
we're especially interested in optimal

537
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
security of uh

538
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,200
on clonability because broadband and

539
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,360
lord also showed that

540
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,960
it implies unclean blind

541
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,640
distinguishability

542
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
which we use to construct copper

543
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
protection

544
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
in the final portion of the talk i will

545
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
summarize our copy protection

546
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
construction giving an unclaimable and

547
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
distinguishable secure scheme

548
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
we

549
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,280
it's considered a specific class of

550
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
point functions

551
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
and the distribution over this class

552
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,840
depends also on a signature scheme

553
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,919
and the construction itself is very

554
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,760
simple

555
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,559
to copy protect we simply

556
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,919
encrypt

557
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,720
the signature using the key

558
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,200
which are parameters of the function

559
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,240
and we also give the verification key of

560
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,960
the signature in the open

561
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
as previously mentioned we can only

562
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,400
guarantee computational correctness

563
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,679
however computational correctness

564
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,679
has been used

565
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,480
in

566
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,080
a slightly different context

567
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,039
with classical bbb obfuscation and it

568
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,919
also captures the intuition that the

569
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,480
client will not experience

570
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,520
problems of incorrectness

571
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,919
it is also not that big in the sense

572
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,840
that it's stronger than the recently

573
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,480
used notion called distribution

574
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,159
correctness

575
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
however one issue with this weaker

576
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,559
notion of correctness is that

577
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,279
unlike per input correctness we cannot

578
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,000
ensure

579
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,240
reusability of the program unless it

580
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,640
it's used honestly

581
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,360
it's important to note that

582
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,559
due to the

583
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
qram construction

584
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,919
uh

585
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,279
before

586
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,720
us

587
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,440
the

588
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,559
search for unclonable

589
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,640
indistinguishability

590
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,360
needs to be in the plain model to be

591
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,200
meaningful

592
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
and here are a couple of concurrent

593
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,279
works which achieves similar results

594
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
we note that sort of

595
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,919
encryption with certified deletion

596
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
is a weaker primitive

597
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
but the authors achieve classical

598
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,799
deletion

599
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,840
therefore

600
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
have incomparable results

601
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,760
to summarize our contributions can be

602
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
presented as

603
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
private key and public key

604
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
on clonable encryption

605
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
which satisfy

606
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,919
semantic security

607
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,120
and we analyze the secure unclonable

608
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,679
security of conjugate encryption

609
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,799
and provide a lower bound using a simple

610
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,240
cloning attack

611
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
and in terms of upper bound we don't

612
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
have a concrete value yet we open a new

613
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,640
avenue

614
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
uh for

615
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
using monogamy of entanglement to

616
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
achieve that

617
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,840
and finally we show that

618
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
the stronger primitive unclonable and

619
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
distinguishability implies copy

620
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
protection for point functions

621
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,080
and

622
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
to build build on this

623
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,520
the reusability

624
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
can be

625
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,159
extended to the unclonability setting

626
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,200
especially in the private key setting

627
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
and of course to

628
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
make our

629
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,840
generalized construction meaningful

630
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
we hope that

631
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,279
monogamy games that are better than the

632
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,240
bb-84 game will be discovered

633
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,559
and

634
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
it of course the biggest open question

635
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,960
is whether uncondolent

636
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,880
distinguishability is feasible or not

637
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
and it turns out to be

638
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
a particularly challenging problem

639
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,559
and

640
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,440
one could also try to improve the

641
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,919
computational correctness

642
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,520
to statistical correctness

643
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
and that concludes my talk thank you for

644
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,120
listening
