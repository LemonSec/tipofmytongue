00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,520
welcome to the presentation of our paper

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,879
direct product hardness amplification

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,120
we want to start off by introducing the

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,840
basic objects we are considering

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,960
we are interested in probabilistic games

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,440
that are interactive objects where

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,279
a winner w that may also be

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,880
probabilistic

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
may interact with this object

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
possibly via multiple rounds exchanging

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,000
messages

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,359
and the game has a winning condition

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,760
here denoted by b which may be thought

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,399
of as an additional output bit

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
that is monotone where essentially at

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
some point the game says

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
the game was won

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,840
or it was

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
lost will not talk about very specific

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
concrete kind of games in this talk

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,199
but we will

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,360
somehow assume a certain kind of

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,199
structure on the games so it may be

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
useful for the purpose of this talk to

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
think of the games that we talk about as

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
say for example being the one-way

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,400
function in version game or the hash

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,880
function collision finding game

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
or say the mac forgery or signature

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
forgery game for a certain mac or

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,839
signature scheme

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
a natural thing one might want to do

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
with such games is to compose multiple

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,560
of them in parallel

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,439
and to obtain a new game say the end of

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,640
two games g and h

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,520
where

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,040
a winner w can interact with both g

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
and h in parallel and this new game is

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,479
one if and only if both g and h have

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,920
been one

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
this is interesting because it leads to

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
natural constructions to

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
amplify the security of certain

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
cryptographic schemes for example one

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,119
can take multiple

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280
weak one-way functions and combine them

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,799
to obtain a new

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
strong one-way function so for example

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
one would need to only assume or say

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,439
prove

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,200
a weaker kind of security for

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
the

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,439
building blocks

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
and then could just use such a

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
construction to amplify the security

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,040
the hope is

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,120
that it's much more difficult to win the

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
end of the games than just win one of

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,840
the individual games for themselves

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,560
and intuitively one would hope that

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,239
actually the hardness of the end of

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,520
some games

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
is just a product of the hardness of the

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
individual games or because the games

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
are independent one would hope that the

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
hardness essentially just multiplies

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
actually in an information theoretic

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
setting this is

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
not trivial but also not too difficult

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
to prove that this is true

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,519
in a perfect sense with equality and

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,599
essentially for any games g and h

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,560
in this work we are considering the

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
more difficult computational setting

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,879
where

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,640
one would basically need to

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
argue via a reduction basically reduce

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,319
the winner w to a winner for just g and

80
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,680
h

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,959
and

82
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,879
then

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,519
that the hardness multiplies is only

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,720
true

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,440
in an approximate sense not with

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,239
equality anymore

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
before we look at this reduction in more

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
detail

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,760
we state our main results

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,959
first

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
we state and prove an abstract hardness

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
amplification theorem that is simpler

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
more general and stronger than previous

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,159
theorems of the same or similar kind

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,519
and our focus is twofold first we try to

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
provide close to optimal concrete bounds

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
as opposed to asymptotic ones

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
whereas still

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
these asymptotic results basically

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
follow our simple corollaries to our

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
concrete bounds

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,680
and second we in the spirit of of

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
abstraction we try to distill out the

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
essence of such hardness amplification

105
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,480
results and try to provide a theorem

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
that is

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,280
not only simpler

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
but also so general that it allows for

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,880
reusability

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
we then show in a second part how to

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
apply and essentially instantiate the

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
theorem to non-trivial interactive

113
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
cryptographic games such as

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
the mac forgery or signature forgery

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
game

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
let's look more closely at the reduction

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
we are considering

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
we are considering any winner just for

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,280
the end of these two games

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
g and h

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
and we want to turn it so this is the

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
winner we want to turn this winner into

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
a winner for only g and for only h so

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
essentially we're considering two

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
reductions

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
and the only straightforward way to do

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
this in the black box black box fashion

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
is just to absorb

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,320
and say essentially simulate an instance

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,600
of age towards this winner w to obtain a

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
new winner let's call it w h

132
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,080
just for g so this is a winner that just

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,919
plays g

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,199
and and likewise we can just absorb g

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
into into w to obtain this winner wg

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
just for h

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
now we would like to argue that it is

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,680
easier

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
to win just g or just h than to win the

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,240
end of g and h

141
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
so we would somehow

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
like to argue that the winning

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
probability here for just g

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
or here for just h

145
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
must be higher than the winning

146
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
probability here for the end of the two

147
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
games

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
unfortunately though if we think about

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
this it's not that hard to see that

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
actually can happen

151
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
that the winner is such that

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
always both games g

153
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
and h are one never just one of them so

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
either both or none of them are one

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,440
and if the winner is of this type

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
then actually the winning probability

157
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
here and here will be just the same as

158
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
here on the left

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
this is why

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
it's necessary to somehow boost the

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,880
winning probability of wh

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,039
and wg

163
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
and this is where you need a certain

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,479
structure on the game you need to assume

165
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
that the game has a sufficient structure

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
that allows to

167
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
repeat to boost basically this winning

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,039
probability typically this is done

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,639
this is really the standard way to

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,800
repeat a winner

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,160
q times for some number of q

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
so basically the game needs to allow us

173
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
to attempt multiple times

174
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
and many easy games have this kind of

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
structure say for example if it's the

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
one-way function inversion game where we

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,560
are given an instance that we need to

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
invert say find a pre-image then we can

179
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
just try multiple times of course and

180
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
then once at some point we are

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
successful in one at least one attempt

182
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
we invert the

183
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
the image and then we found the correct

184
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
pre-image and then we are successful we

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
have won the game

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
so let's look at an example

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
say we are considering a winner w that

188
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
here on the left has a winning

189
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
probability of delta say one percent

190
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,800
on the end of g and h

191
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,759
and now

192
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
we consider these winners but

193
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
boosted by repeating them q times such

194
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
that we win

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
if we win at least one of the queue

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,560
attempts that we make here and here

197
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
how often do we need to repeat how large

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
does q need to be to obtain a winning

199
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
probability that is close to the square

200
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
root of delta remember that we want this

201
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
basically probabilities probabilities to

202
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
multiply so we want this to be basically

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
the square root of delta

204
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,440
but say we want only to get close to it

205
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
say we are we are good not with 10 but

206
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
only say

207
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,160
9.9 percent for g or h

208
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
and by the classical analysis one can

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,400
show

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,440
that

211
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
if one repeats for say around 76 000

212
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
times

213
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
then in it at least one of the cases

214
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
here

215
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,958
we get actually this winning probability

216
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,559
of 9.9 percent at least

217
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
if assuming of course the game has as

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
this this structure that it allows us to

219
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,600
repeat

220
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
and the question is is it really

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
necessary and what is the optimal number

222
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
of q here

223
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
obviously this is a basically a

224
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
tightness gap in the reduction and this

225
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
should be as small as possible this q

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,920
should be ideally very very small

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,920
as a consequence of our new result

228
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
we can plug in the numbers and we

229
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,399
immediately get that actually

230
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
for these numbers only 90 repetitions

231
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
are sufficient

232
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
and this is quite close to optimal one

233
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,760
can

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
easily see that actually 44 repetitions

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,399
are really necessary here

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
but what are we analyzing here exactly

237
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,640
let's

238
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
lay out the setting we consider the

239
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
games g and h to be probability

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
distributions over some finite sets

241
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
calligraphic g and calligraphic age

242
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
respectively

243
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
and these are basically the

244
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
deterministic the sets of the

245
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
deterministic instances of the game so

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
this calligraphic g and h

247
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,920
and it doesn't really matter what kinds

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
of objects the games are themselves we

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
just assume these to be some kind of

250
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
probability distribution over

251
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,000
deterministic instances of games

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
and then we fix any winner w for the and

253
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
of g and h and again it doesn't really

254
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,000
matter what kind of object this veiner w

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,800
is

256
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
the only thing that matters is that

257
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
it induces a function mu

258
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,160
that basically tells us for any pair

259
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
gh

260
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
of deterministic instances

261
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,040
what is the probability that w wins both

262
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
g

263
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
and h

264
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
and then of course the problem we are

265
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,600
interested in the probability that w

266
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
wins the actual games the end of this

267
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
actual two games g and h and this is

268
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
just the expectation over g and h over

269
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,000
this function move where g and h are

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
independent

271
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,200
and now we look at

272
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
the reduction that we've shown before

273
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,480
basically we consider this

274
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
winner wh but repeated q times such that

275
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
he's successful

276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,079
if he wins in at least one

277
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
or of of the q attempts

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
against g

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,079
and it's easy to see that this has to be

280
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
at least this quantity so this is just

281
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
the expectation we play g so we take the

282
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,279
expectation over g

283
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,600
and then on each attempt

284
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
we have

285
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
this at least this success probability

286
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
simulating a fresh instance of of h

287
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,600
towards towards the winner

288
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
and then we repeat this

289
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,839
q times independently and then this is

290
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
just the probability that we win at

291
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
least once or that we do not lose q

292
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,770
times

293
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,279
[Music]

294
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,720
is this function

295
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
psi here

296
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
and then we can do the same for

297
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,200
the reduction towards h

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
where somehow just these expectations

299
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,000
are swapped it's just x we play h so the

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,399
expectation is here over h

301
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
and now the goal is essentially to

302
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,200
analyze the relationship between

303
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,320
this expectation the probability that w

304
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
wins the end of g and h and these two

305
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
expectations here

306
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,880
the probability that the

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
winner that we derived from the

308
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,880
reduction wins g

309
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
and

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,519
that the winner

311
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,480
wins

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,360
h

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
this is basically the winning

314
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
probability of h this is the winning

315
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
probability of g and this is the winning

316
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,880
probability

317
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
that

318
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
w wins the end of the two games

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
and the idea is that we just analyze

320
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,440
this for any function for any

321
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
distributions g and h and for any

322
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
function mu

323
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
the main difficulty is somehow that we

324
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
have to we do not really know how this

325
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,160
function

326
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,519
looks like this winning structure

327
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,560
where which instances of the of the and

328
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
which pairs are one and with what

329
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,639
probability so we have to assume the

330
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
analysis has to work for basically the

331
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
worst case mu

332
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,639
that that we could get

333
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
so for example this mu is essentially a

334
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,399
two-dimensional map it could look like

335
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,040
this right assume that our winner

336
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,519
is deterministic doesn't have to be so

337
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
this we cannot just assume this but for

338
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
simplicity just let's just consider a

339
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
winner w that that is deterministic and

340
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,959
wins

341
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,920
um

342
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
the instances basically that are just a

343
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,480
cartesian product of two

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,079
such subsets of of g and h denoted here

345
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,360
by sg and sh these are the instances

346
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,240
basically if if a pair of instances hits

347
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
into this rectangle then

348
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
both

349
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,639
instances g and h the end is one say the

350
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
winning probability in here would be one

351
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,760
and it would be zero outside

352
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
and this is a very simple case is

353
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
somehow straightforward it would also

354
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
look like this if

355
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,720
a w played the games g and h

356
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,519
independently

357
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,720
but in general the analysis has to take

358
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
into account basically any kind of shape

359
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
not only the rectangle that we could

360
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
have here

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,240
and this is somehow the difficulty that

362
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,199
one needs to tackle

363
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,560
okay

364
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
so let's look at how we state the actual

365
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
amplification theorem

366
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,399
as we've seen before we just assume g

367
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
and h to be any probability

368
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
distributions over some finite sets

369
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,839
called graphic g and h and then we

370
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,680
assume just some function mu which is

371
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,199
the winning structure essentially

372
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,639
describing on which pairs of

373
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,720
deterministic instances the end is one

374
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
but just any function mu

375
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
and then we assume

376
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,199
some

377
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
monotonically increasing boosting

378
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
function for simplicity we just let this

379
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,600
be any function

380
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
and then we assume that

381
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,839
what corresponds to this expectation

382
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
here essentially corresponds to the

383
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
winning probability of

384
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
um

385
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
of the winner through the reduction on

386
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
on g

387
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,079
to be

388
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,360
bounded

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
and like somewhat small and the winning

390
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,800
probability on an h to be somewhat small

391
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
and the expression

392
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,800
here is just chosen so that we can state

393
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,920
the result in in a in a convenient way

394
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
and then we can apply the classical

395
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
analysis and and see that this

396
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,000
expectation here which corresponds to

397
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
the and the winning probability of the

398
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,800
and of the two games to be even smaller

399
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
than this and that for themselves so you

400
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
see that you actually get amplification

401
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,600
but now we notice that once we've

402
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,680
basically

403
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,920
removed everything that was unnecessary

404
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
and state the result at this simple and

405
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,279
general sort of abstract level

406
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,759
it becomes easy

407
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,360
to actually

408
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
check whether this is really optimal and

409
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,240
actually to show something stronger so

410
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,560
we then observe that if we moreover

411
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
assume that this boosting function psi

412
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
is not only monotonically increasing but

413
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
also concave which it typically is

414
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
because this is the standard boosting

415
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,199
function that you would would use for

416
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
these kinds of results then actually you

417
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
can show a stronger

418
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,440
amplification so you can show that

419
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
actually this expectation here is even

420
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
smaller than with the the usual analysis

421
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,279
and this is basically what gives us

422
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
these these better numbers that we've

423
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
seen before in the numerical example

424
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
so finally we state some more results

425
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,279
that we have in the paper but where we

426
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,880
have no time to discuss them in this

427
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,199
short talk so obviously we just talked

428
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,639
about two games say g and h

429
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,880
the end of two games and obviously we

430
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
have uh

431
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,079
end fault variants of this where it's

432
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
basically about amplification for n

433
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
games and then we also have corollaries

434
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,919
for

435
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,799
not just any function psi but this

436
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,119
typical amplification function psi here

437
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,000
1 minus 1 minus x to the q

438
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,839
because this is the typical case and we

439
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,959
give simpler expressions that uh

440
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,359
work just for assume this particular

441
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
function

442
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
and then we have a tightness discussion

443
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
where basically we show that what we do

444
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,080
the kind of amplification results we

445
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,200
obtain

446
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
are close to optimal

447
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
but still not perfect and we have a

448
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
conjecture

449
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
for a perfectly optimal amplification

450
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,559
result which is somewhat interesting in

451
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
which we would be quite excited to to

452
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
prove at some point

453
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,559
and we think it's doable so loosely

454
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,720
speaking the the conjecture says that at

455
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
least for this this particular um

456
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
amplification or as a boosting function

457
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,640
one minus one minus extra q the worst

458
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,559
case that can happen in terms of the

459
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,480
amplification is that either the winning

460
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
or the losing probability of the consent

461
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,160
of winner is maximally concentrated

462
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
where maximally concentrated essentially

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
means that there is a

464
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
rectangle one rectangle where the

465
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,679
probability of winning or the

466
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
probability of losing is one

467
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
in the whole rectangle and outside of

468
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,960
the ranked angle it's it's zero

469
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,760
and then finally we

470
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,000
show some applications to the game such

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
as the mac forgery or signature forgery

472
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
game

473
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
where the key message we try to convey

474
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,720
is actually that now we can basically

475
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,640
inherit the amplification just from

476
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
uh from the from the amplification

477
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
theorem that we have proved

478
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,000
and the main analysis for these games is

479
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
just concerned with explaining how this

480
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
boosting actually works because it

481
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,200
doesn't work in a perfectly natural

482
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,039
way as it does for say one way functions

483
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
or similar say hash function collision

484
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
games

485
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,000
and if you're interested in any of this

486
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,840
you can just check out our paper it's on

487
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,320
eprint thank you
