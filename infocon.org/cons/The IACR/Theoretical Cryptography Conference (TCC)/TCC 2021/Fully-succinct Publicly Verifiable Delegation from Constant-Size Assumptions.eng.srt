00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,200
hello and welcome to my tcc 2021 talk

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,799
about fully succinct verifiable

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
delegation from constant size

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
assumptions i am allowed sales and this

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,280
is joint work with alexandros zakarakis

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,320
a delegation scheme what is a delegation

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,199
scheme

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,039
in a delegation scheme

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,920
a computationally constrained verifier

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,119
would like to

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,279
delegate some heavy but still polynomial

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,880
time computation

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,720
which in this case will represent by

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
some circuit c

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,280
and the the statement the verifier would

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
like to check is whether c evaluated on

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,600
x

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,320
outputs y

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
um

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
so the verifier delegates this

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
computation to a more powerful but still

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
polynomial time improver

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,559
which evaluates the circuit but also

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,160
produce produces some proof pie

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,559
which is sent to the verifier okay so we

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,640
are just considering what message this

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
could be interactive also but in this

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
case it's just one message okay

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,159
um the verifier then

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
checks the proof if it's valid or not

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
and of course checking the proof should

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,360
take

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,680
less time than just evaluating the

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,560
circle okay so otherwise i will fire

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,799
just about the circuit no

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,680
um okay so a related notion is that of

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,759
an argument of knowledge for mp for

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,159
example because in this case it

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,960
is an argument of knowledge

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,159
in b

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
no so this is a p

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,439
statement

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,799
so

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,600
a snark is also a delegation scheme but

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
the statement is more general also

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
there is no x and the proverb shows that

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,360
it knows some x that makes the circuit

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
output y

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,439
uh i said that because in order to come

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
to see what is available in the

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
literature we also need to consider

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,840
snarks or for example we can start with

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
group 16

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,799
which is kind of

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,119
optimal in some sense

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,520
and very attractive in practice because

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
the size of the proof is just a constant

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
number of group elements and the

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
verification time

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,239
is just a constant number of pairing

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,239
evaluations okay and this is what we

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,520
call in this work fully succinct

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
okay so

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,680
then the expressivity so you can show

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
the

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
you can show the validity of any np

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
statement

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,599
but this comes at a price if you want to

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,840
have

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
succinct verification and proof size

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
and such a

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,480
large amount of exclusivity

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
you need to rely on non-falsifiable

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
assumptions that is an assumption for

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
which it is not

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
you cannot efficiently check if an

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
adversary breaks the assumption or not

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,879
so in fact there are impossibility

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,120
results which says that any snark for mp

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
so any argument for mp which is also

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
succinct

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,599
needs to be based on non-falsifiable

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,360
assumptions

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
and indeed this is the case of growth

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
cysteine which is proven

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
sound

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
in the genetic group model or the

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
algebraic model so in this work we want

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,840
to move below the success now this axis

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,920
we want to go below this plane here

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,399
and use falsifiable assumptions okay so

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,159
and

93
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,760
with falsifial assumptions there's the

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
work of kalai panjang at stock 19

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
which is based on the work of panetta

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
and roadblown

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
this is c17

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,120
they

99
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,519
[Music]

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,920
they have a delegation scheme so so

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
since they so they base their scheme on

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
falsifiable assumptions so here's a

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
queue assumption this is an assumption

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
that grows with the size of the

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
computation

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,810
um

107
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,159
[Music]

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,799
but so so in order to do so to to be

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,239
based on falsified assumptions you

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
cannot have

111
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,680
an argument for mp but just for p so

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
yeah the legation is key no

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,159
but the good thing is that the the size

114
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,319
of the proof is 16 so it's shorter

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,159
relating there's a real delegation

116
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,000
scheme evaluating the proof and the

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
proof size

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,199
is linear in the size of the circuit but

119
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
it still is larger than than grout 16

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,680
and in this world we would like to have

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
something like globe 16 and

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
based on even better assumptions because

123
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
this assumption grows

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,919
with the um

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,639
with the size of the circuit no so we

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,919
also put here

127
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
panel problem because it's very related

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
but the assumption is worse so it's

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,320
based on

130
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
multi-linear maps and obfuscation okay

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
so we want to so we want to have

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,479
something here

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,560
and the assumption is even better than

134
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
an acute assumption so our order one

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
assumption which is ddh the lin

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
um

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,400
so

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
a good candidate for

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
for for for for something like that is

140
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
what is known as a quest adaptive an

141
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
interactive syrian knowledge proof well

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
introduced by jude lang roy and

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
but the the most efficient

144
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
instantiations were proposed by

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,120
other researchers

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
long line research of work

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
where they construct very short proofs

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
so comparable to to

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
to to the proofs of clock system and

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,199
also the verification time is also

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
a constant time so it's

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
a constant number of pairing evaluations

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,759
and the proof size is a constant number

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
of group

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
on the other hand assumption is very

156
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,160
good so it's

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
tdh or the lean

158
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280
or

159
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,080
it's so constant size assumptions

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
but the problem is expressivity

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,280
exclusivity is just for very simple

162
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
languages so linear languages and some

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,560
restricted non-linear languages okay so

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
what we are going to do now

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,120
is

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
to start from qnusik and using other

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,720
techniques like the one of calipanian

168
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,319
we are going to extend the expressivity

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
of uniseq in order to get to p

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,560
okay so let's see what let's see how um

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
we construct this delegation scheme

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
so as we said before we start from q and

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,639
using this is going to be our brick you

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,960
know so our starting point because they

175
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,440
have what we want they have good proof

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,720
size is just around one group element

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
or a constant number of group element

178
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
and it's based on good assumptions so on

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
the other hand we are going to use the

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
techniques of penetrator problem and

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
collect pine junk so what they call

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
quasi arguments in cali penjang so but

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
the important thing is that they have

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
what is called as a non-signaling

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
extraction

186
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,440
and they use what they show is that with

187
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,199
these quasi arguments and using this

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,840
node scenario structure you can get

189
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
delegation

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,039
for bonded with circuit

191
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
but as we see before

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,919
um but they also extend their work for

193
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
for for managing other circuits

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
but the problem is that the proof is not

195
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
fully succinct so it's not a constant

196
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,080
number of loop elements

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
then the assumption is not constant size

198
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
so what we do is we construct new of

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
this question argument but based on q

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,280
and you seek so that they also inherit

201
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
the short truth size and the good

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
assumptions so we managed to get fully

203
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
successful delegation or bounded with

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,000
circuit from delete

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
in order to extend these techniques

206
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,800
to

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
to

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
do any circuit no

209
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,240
we use the work our work at asia grid 19

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,879
which is a delegation for bounded depth

211
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
circuit no this is bonded with

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,759
growth

213
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
so if you take any secret growth with

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
the width and this one

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400
the size of the proof and the

216
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
verification time grows with the depth

217
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
so we we mix the two things and we get

218
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
some proof which

219
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,720
don't grow with the grid so it doesn't

220
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,440
grow

221
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
with the width nor with the

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,000
depth so it's and it's fully succinct

223
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
and based just on the link so the only

224
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,400
thing that we need to solve here

225
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
in this work is that this is based on q

226
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
assumptions and

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
uh

228
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
since we want to base just some constant

229
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
size assumptions so we need to extend

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
these techniques in order to be based on

231
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,199
constant size assumptions so in this

232
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
case on sxdh

233
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
okay

234
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
so let's start to let's see

235
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
in more detail this ingredients so let's

236
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
start with these classy arguments of

237
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
knowledge of kalei panjang and with no

238
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
signature extraction so

239
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
um accuracy argument of knowledge is a

240
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
religious relaxation of an argument of

241
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
knowledge because if since we also want

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,279
succinctness an argument of knowledge

243
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,959
turns out to be something very hard to

244
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,519
construct if we also wants a sickness

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,839
no and because of the following reasons

246
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,320
so an argument of knowledge gives the

247
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,640
following soundness guarantees or what

248
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
is known as knowledge sounded so for any

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
adversary breaking soundness there is an

250
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
extractor

251
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
which proceed as follows so it generates

252
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
some

253
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
some parameters global parameters public

254
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
parameters

255
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
and then simulates the adversary on

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,320
input these parameters and the random

257
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,519
coins

258
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,080
until this adversary outputs a statement

259
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,519
in a proof

260
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,320
and if this process if is

261
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,040
if the proof is valid

262
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,000
the extractor should also output a

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
witness

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
for the statement okay and here's the

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,279
problem so the proof size is quite sure

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,760
while the witness

267
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
in general is

268
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
much more larger

269
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,680
no and the problem is how to extract

270
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399
this amount of information from this

271
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,120
very short amount of information

272
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
and the answer is that the only way to

273
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
do that is by using

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,760
a

275
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
non-falsifiable assumption as being

276
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,199
shown by gentry and which

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
so since we want to avoid non-fanciferal

278
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
assumptions we cannot use an argument of

279
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
knowledge and we are received to use

280
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
weaker notions which is the case of a

281
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,839
quasi-argument of knowledge

282
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
which are parameterized by some

283
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,519
parameter the locality parameter which

284
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,760
is some integer k much shorter than the

285
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,839
size of the

286
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,360
witness okay and we are also going to

287
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,279
build an extractor

288
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,440
but it's a little different it receives

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,399
input

290
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,600
a subset of the positions in the witness

291
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
okay

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,920
and of course this subset is of size

293
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,800
shorter than the locality parameter

294
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
in the

295
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
the extractor which is similarly as

296
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,160
before it simulates that bursary that

297
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
there is a output statement and proof

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,640
and if the proof is valid we are not

299
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
going to extract the whole witness which

300
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,480
is very hard but just a small weakness

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
uh which is um

302
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
called the local witness no so it's the

303
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
witness for

304
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
basically for the position defined by s

305
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
and this witness needs to be locally

306
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,279
sound

307
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
what is localism well it depends on the

308
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
language for example let's take the

309
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
language of

310
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
satisfying

311
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,600
sorry

312
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,279
the language of formulas boolean

313
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
formulas satisfying with the formulas

314
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
which are the and of many clauses and

315
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
this each of these clauses now is the or

316
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
of many variables

317
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
and now

318
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,399
so a formula is in the language if there

319
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,399
is a satisfying assignment so this is

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,240
the witness now is a satisfying

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
assignment for the formula it gives

322
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
value to the variables

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,720
but now a restructure

324
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
extract of course a local witness

325
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
no a local assignment so it's an

326
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
assignment that gives value to just a

327
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,839
number or a limited number of variables

328
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,480
so what does it mean

329
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
previous question on the previous slide

330
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,120
was

331
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
what does it mean for the local witness

332
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,000
local assignment in this case to be

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,279
locally sound

334
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,440
okay so we're going to define a local

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
formula and this local formula is going

336
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,600
to contain just the clauses for which

337
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,959
all the

338
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,399
all the variables

339
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
belongs to this set

340
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,839
okay

341
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
and now the local witness is going to be

342
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,120
locally sound

343
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
if the local formula

344
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
is valid no

345
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,560
many locals um

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
okay but in

347
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
this was the notion of local soundness

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,360
used by kalai panjang

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
but we are going to use

350
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
another so this were the language used

351
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
by kanek panjang so they used formulas

352
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
and we are going to use another kind of

353
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
language

354
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
so our statements are going to be

355
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
commitments and our witness opening to

356
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
this commitment no and

357
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
the

358
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
the statement is going to be true if

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,560
there is some opening for this

360
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,040
commitment and this opening satisfies

361
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
some linear relation okay so it's in the

362
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,959
image of this matrix m and the local

363
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,200
extractor is going to open a local

364
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,800
opening so as a small part here of the

365
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
of the

366
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
commitment so a local

367
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
a local opening for the commitment and

368
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
this local opening needs to satisfy the

369
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
corresponding equations now so if the

370
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
local commitment appears here then it

371
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
need to satisfy the matrix so the matrix

372
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
this is matrix of the rows

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
of the respective rules no

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
and we also consider another language

375
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
the language of hadamard relations which

376
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
is also the statements our commitment

377
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
now three commitments

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,199
and um

379
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,040
the statement is going to be true if

380
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,519
there is an opening for the commitments

381
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,720
for each of the commitments and these uh

382
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
openings satisfy this harem relate

383
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
hadamard relation also this is the entry

384
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,720
wise multiplication so it's saying that

385
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,880
the first entry is equal to the

386
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
multiplication of the two

387
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
and now the local extractor is going to

388
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,560
extract a small part of the witness

389
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
and this small parts of the witness here

390
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,800
here and here needs to satisfy the

391
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
corresponding relations

392
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
okay so

393
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,839
as we say before this question argument

394
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,120
also have

395
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
what was called

396
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,199
what is

397
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,360
a known signaling extraction and it's

398
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
defined as follow so we consider two

399
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
experiments one on the left and the

400
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
other in the right

401
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
and we're going to take two different

402
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,040
sets

403
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
now a larger set

404
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,959
shorter than the locality parameter and

405
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,720
a subset of the step

406
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
in the first experiment we are going to

407
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
run the extractor the local extractor

408
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
which is going to output some local

409
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,079
weakness with respect to the set s but

410
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,120
since

411
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
s prime is containing s so all the

412
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
positions in s prime are in s we are

413
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
going to restrict the extracted witness

414
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
to the smaller cell

415
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
and in the other experiment we are going

416
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
to extract a shorter weakness

417
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,880
and the condition needs requires that

418
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,639
the two distributions are

419
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
computationally indistinguishable

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,120
okay so let's see now how to use

421
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
nodes in an extraction

422
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
so quasi arguments for building

423
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
delegation for bounded depth circuits so

424
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,959
this is what was shown about penetroblum

425
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,279
and calais pigeon

426
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,240
so

427
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
we are going to take a circuit

428
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,680
of depth the

429
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,040
d and

430
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,959
with s

431
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,000
and we are going to divide this circuit

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
in all the levels now so depending on

433
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
the distance from the inputs

434
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
okay so we are going to have d levels

435
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,399
where this is the the multiplicative

436
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,800
depth of the circuit

437
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
and each of the level is going to look

438
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,959
as follows so the inputs of the level

439
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,320
are going to be the output of the

440
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,839
previous level

441
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,959
then all these squares are going to pass

442
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,199
through a linear transformation

443
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
and if you think of a boolean circuit

444
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,680
this linear transformation is some wires

445
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,480
now this wire goes here and also goes

446
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,519
here

447
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
this other wire goes here and in general

448
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
for an arithmetic circuit you can also

449
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
take linear combination of the language

450
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
of the wires now so you can have two

451
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,839
wires and multiply by some constant and

452
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,880
so on

453
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
okay but at the output we're going to

454
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
have a set of left wires

455
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,480
and a set of right wires

456
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
and this left and right right wires are

457
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,000
going to be the inputs

458
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to multiplication gates

459
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,079
and now the output of the level is going

460
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
to be the hadamard product so the

461
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
entry-wise probe of

462
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
um

463
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
the left wires and the right wires also

464
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
basically what we have here is kind of

465
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,079
the language that we saw before now the

466
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,000
here we have the linear transformation

467
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
and here we have the hadamard relation

468
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
okay so

469
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
how to

470
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,439
build the delegation scheme for bondable

471
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,400
circuit so now we are going to commit to

472
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
all the left wires but we are going to

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,799
start from the left most no first we are

474
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
going to take the one left most here so

475
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,919
we are going to pass through this wire

476
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,280
but not this one and then the

477
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,760
the other wires no they're the ones that

478
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,039
go to the right

479
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,240
now we start here and then we go through

480
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
here and so on

481
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
until we get um

482
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,919
s commitment as shrinking commitments no

483
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,640
so this is in the end grows

484
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
with the width so that's why it's for

485
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,240
the

486
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
so this is part of the proof and then

487
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
the proof grows with the width of the

488
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
circuit and it's just substance for

489
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,360
bonded temp circuit and then we do the

490
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
same for the the right wires and the

491
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
output wires

492
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,200
and importantly we have

493
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
uh

494
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
many q arguments for the linear hadamard

495
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,440
relations known so one for for for the

496
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
leftmost and another for the other ones

497
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,840
and so on so we have also s plus

498
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,200
argument for the linear hadamard

499
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,559
relation

500
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
now how to see that this is sound that

501
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,600
indeed y needs to be

502
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
the right evaluation of the circuit and

503
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,120
input x

504
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280
so let's start we're going to extract

505
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,919
the use the local extraction to extract

506
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,799
the commitments at many levels no so we

507
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,360
can extract here and this level here so

508
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
we're going to start by extracting the

509
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,640
first level okay so we extract a11 h1

510
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
and so on no

511
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,000
so and

512
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
by local soundness it

513
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,200
needs to hold that the left and right

514
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
wires are the right linear

515
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,160
transformation of the inputs now so they

516
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
are consistent in some sense with the

517
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
input they are the right the honest

518
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
evaluation of the

519
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,039
and the same for c1 no because c1 is the

520
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
hadamard product of these two and then

521
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
is the honest evaluation of

522
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
of the circuit and input x node

523
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
now we are going to change the section

524
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
set now we have a smaller so this set is

525
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
contained here

526
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,799
and then if

527
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,960
this is consistent with x then also this

528
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,240
needs to be consistent with x

529
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,799
why because being consistent so being

530
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
the right evaluation is something that

531
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
if it is efficiently uh you can check it

532
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,280
efficiently because well it's just

533
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,679
evaluating a circuit no

534
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,400
then some these two need to be

535
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
computationally distinguishable this

536
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,400
also needs to be the

537
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
honest evaluation

538
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,880
no because otherwise you can distinguish

539
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,799
the two experiments and break no

540
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,240
signaling

541
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
so we can change again the

542
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,360
destruction sent i go a little below so

543
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
we are taking just a

544
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
second the output of the first level and

545
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,400
the

546
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
the well not the input but the left and

547
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
right wires of the next level and for

548
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,799
the same reason c1 needs to also be

549
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,919
consistent with the input

550
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,760
and now by local sound sounds we know

551
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,000
that a2 and b2 are the right linear

552
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
transformation of the output of the

553
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
previous level and we can continue until

554
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,120
we get

555
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
till the end and

556
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
so our invariant is whatever we extract

557
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,880
is consistent with the input and in

558
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
particular the output needs to be

559
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
consistent with the input and then this

560
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
is sound

561
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,960
very nice so

562
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
um

563
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,080
quasi arguments of knowledge

564
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,840
is what we need for building delegation

565
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
okay but as we saw say before so kalai

566
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
panyang

567
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,880
already

568
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,919
build quasi arguments

569
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,799
but

570
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,840
the argument were not fully succinct and

571
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
were not based on constant sense

572
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
assumptions

573
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
so we are going to base these classified

574
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
arguments on q and you seek so what is a

575
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,000
cuneisique so for now we are just going

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,960
to see a q a c for inner spaces

577
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
okay so in a chaosic argument we have a

578
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
vector of group elements so we have a

579
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
bilinear group

580
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
okay so

581
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
so groups provided with a padding

582
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,520
and we want to show that this vector

583
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,520
belongs to the image of some matrix no

584
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,480
so the similar the same language is what

585
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
uh

586
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,799
what is

587
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,440
what is proven with a hash proof system

588
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,919
you know this tool introduced by kramer

589
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,960
and shub for showing cca to security and

590
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
have many other applications and the

591
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
good thing is that the proofs are very

592
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,200
short so

593
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,559
are very short and they are based on

594
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,240
very good assumptions so

595
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
not even an assumption it's

596
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
statistically sound

597
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
but the problem is that they are

598
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,480
designated verifier so there is a secret

599
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
key for

600
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
checking

601
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
if a proof is false or not so it's a

602
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
valid or not so

603
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,440
and so the proofs are very short there

604
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,520
is a secret key here and in order to

605
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,960
enable the approver to compute the

606
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,679
proofs we publish some public key which

607
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
is the the key times the

608
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,200
the matrix

609
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
which is also called the the the

610
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,919
projected projective key and now the

611
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,159
verify the approver can compute proofs

612
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,159
for a statement in the language and if

613
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,679
the statement is not in the language so

614
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,280
you take a vector

615
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,960
in

616
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
outside the image of m

617
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
it turns out that this public key only

618
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,039
reveals reviews key through m

619
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,360
and the rest of the key is statistically

620
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,480
hidden

621
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
okay so then you can not with high

622
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
probability with of with very high

623
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,039
probability you cannot produce proof for

624
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,480
vectors which are outside the image of f

625
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,880
very good very good assumption nice

626
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
proof

627
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,919
nice proof size so what we want but the

628
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
problem is the

629
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
uh designated verifier thing you know

630
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,080
so what was done with your music is to

631
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
take this hash proof system and provide

632
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
public verifiability by adding paintings

633
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
so this doesn't require any painting and

634
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,320
qnc they're quite appealing but have

635
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
public verifiability and they achieved

636
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,559
that by

637
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,559
also providing some we can think of this

638
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,440
as a commitment key and this value which

639
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,640
is some

640
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,920
um

641
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,200
[Music]

642
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
some

643
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
commitment to the secret key

644
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,240
and now the idea is that you can publish

645
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,720
the secret key

646
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,400
but

647
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
but still

648
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,559
the approver or the nursery don't know

649
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,000
the secret key

650
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,919
and using the painting you can check

651
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,400
basically the same equation no let's

652
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,640
just multiply by a here but it's the

653
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
same equation as before so here the

654
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
modification equation with the secret

655
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
keys k times x in here is similar no but

656
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,159
we have k here

657
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,960
okay so the proof size is still good

658
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
it's just a constant number of group

659
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
elements

660
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,440
the verification equation the

661
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,159
verification time requires the

662
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,240
evaluation regulating a constant number

663
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,279
of pairings and now the the this

664
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,200
assumption under which you prove

665
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,360
soundness is not

666
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
so it's not you don't have a statistical

667
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,559
soundness

668
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,919
but uh

669
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
just

670
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
computational sounds because now you

671
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
need to base soundness on an assumption

672
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,760
but it's still a very good assumption

673
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,559
from

674
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,880
an assumption which is even weaker than

675
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,559
than the ddh

676
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,520
then well it depends on ddh the lien or

677
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
any of the assumptions so a constant

678
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
such assumption so this is a good

679
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
building block okay so now we are going

680
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
to extend these qnc arguments

681
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,960
to um

682
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
to have quasi arguments now so that we

683
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
can build delegation scheme

684
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,799
so we need to define what is a quasi

685
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
argument of membership in a linear space

686
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,080
so as we say so we already defined this

687
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,279
language before

688
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,440
uh so our statements are going to be

689
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,760
commitments and the statement is going

690
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
to be true if there is there exists an

691
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
opening for this commitment

692
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,760
and this

693
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
opening

694
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,799
lies on the image of this matrix

695
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,720
and what we want is to have this local

696
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,919
extractor now that extract a local

697
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,320
opening for the commitment and

698
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,120
we want this local opening to be sound

699
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
so that means it

700
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
it belongs to the

701
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
to the sub matrix of the corresponding

702
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,080
rows

703
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
of m

704
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
but before we are going to start with

705
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
something more simpler which will just

706
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,000
output a local opening regardless of

707
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
soundness or not no so this is some kind

708
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
of commitment no so we have some

709
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,600
commitment here which have a

710
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
local extractor

711
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
and indeed

712
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,039
this is very similar to

713
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,400
what is known as a somewhere

714
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
statistically binding commitment

715
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,640
and but we also will need to add these

716
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
nodes in any extraction

717
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,080
so we start with uh

718
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
with the commitment we introduced at

719
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
asia 15 with alexandria even color

720
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,600
raffles

721
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
uh which were like one so

722
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
somewhere statistically binding for one

723
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,559
coordinate and this mean that

724
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,159
given the commitment

725
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,440
there is some coordinate that is

726
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
completely defined also there is only

727
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,960
one opening for at that coordinate

728
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
and they achieve that by defining the

729
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,960
commitment key as a matrix of just so

730
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
the output so the commitments are two

731
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,919
group elements

732
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
and they have as many rows as um

733
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,200
as the the

734
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
elements of the vectors you want to

735
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,240
commit to this is some kind of

736
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
generalization of feathers and

737
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,159
commitments

738
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,080
but the good thing is that you can

739
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
also sample it in a computational

740
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,200
indistinguishable fashion the

741
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,679
the commitment key such that one of the

742
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,720
rows

743
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
is linearly independent from the others

744
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,200
and that means that

745
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
the corresponding position is unit

746
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,720
uniquely defined by c

747
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,679
okay

748
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,960
um

749
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
okay so starting

750
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,039
from this one ssb

751
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
we showed that they are also have no

752
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,640
synthetic factor so

753
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,159
because there is a way of a

754
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,640
mediterranean way of extracting

755
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,600
from c computing the corresponding

756
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
openings which is

757
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,559
so from g you can construct a matrix t

758
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,080
such that d times g is equal to zero

759
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,520
zero zero

760
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,679
so on one in the

761
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,640
in the linear independent column and

762
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,440
zero zero zero zero and then this

763
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,320
implies that t times the commitment is

764
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,520
equal to x sub i

765
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
okay

766
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,840
so

767
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,240
um ssb commitments are extractable and

768
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,159
the extractor can be shown to be that is

769
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,799
also very easy this that to show that is

770
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,600
no signaling and by just stacking many

771
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,840
of them so k of them you can build

772
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,399
okay

773
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
no signaling ssb commitment with

774
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,320
locality parameter k which is what we

775
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,279
need

776
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,760
okay we also show something stronger so

777
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,880
go directly from k ssb

778
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
which are shorter than

779
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,440
than so basically

780
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,279
so in the end we showed this stronger

781
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,080
relation that kssb are also

782
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,760
no signaling

783
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
and the proof is more complex but the

784
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,840
resulting commitment is shorter

785
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,760
okay now we have the first part that we

786
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,640
wanted and now we need to show that

787
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
the

788
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
the extracted commitment

789
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
belongs to the image of the

790
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,159
corresponding matrix node

791
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,480
so in order to do so we are going to add

792
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,399
a proof

793
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,120
and the proof will be that c

794
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
belongs to the image

795
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,880
of g times m

796
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
okay because c have that that form also

797
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,399
the

798
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,720
the committed value needs to be in the

799
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,640
image of m

800
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
and then c is in the image of

801
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,360
the

802
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
if is on the image of g times m

803
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
but now what we want is so that versa is

804
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
going to provide some proof that shows

805
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,600
that c is in the image but we want to

806
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,760
show that the local opening belongs to

807
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,799
the image of the matrix no and we can we

808
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,000
we are going to see that this is

809
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
possible by using the

810
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,000
the

811
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,360
the linear properties of the qnuc proof

812
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
so

813
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,919
what we want to show is

814
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,559
we want to produce a proof

815
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,640
forex access

816
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
and so we are given

817
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
the public the projected predictive key

818
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
the public key for showing membership in

819
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,240
the image of ms which is some

820
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,159
some secret key k okay dar in this case

821
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,720
and we want to produce a statement and a

822
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
proof for this statement no so it's k

823
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
times

824
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,679
times

825
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,279
the matrix times the witness

826
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
okay so

827
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
we are going to define uh another key so

828
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
we are going to run our adversary for

829
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,399
the quasi argument

830
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
so we are going to then we need to to

831
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
define the crs so we are going to define

832
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
another key which is related to this key

833
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
which we don't know so we are going to

834
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
implicitly define this key as the

835
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,080
secret key one this is the trap door for

836
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,120
the

837
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,159
for the

838
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,000
for the ssb commitment

839
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,760
and some random random key okay

840
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,960
and now

841
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
pi which is so put by diversity is going

842
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,880
to be the so it's correct so it's going

843
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
to be k times c

844
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,600
and it turns out that this is

845
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,399
almost what we want but plus this value

846
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
and since we sampled this value we can

847
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,200
recover the original so the proof for

848
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,880
excess

849
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,039
this is here is excess

850
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,360
so we can obtain excess using the

851
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760
trapdoor and we have also a proof for

852
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,960
excess in it means that excess need to

853
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
belongs to the

854
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,159
to the language

855
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,600
okay so

856
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,519
then what we can also do is extend this

857
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,320
q and seek to some simple quadratic

858
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,840
language and have what we want

859
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,600
with a

860
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,480
quasi argument of membership in little

861
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
space well and also for simple simple

862
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
for the hadamard relation

863
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,399
which you can see in the full paper

864
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,640
we can just build delegation for bounded

865
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,279
depth circuit so we also need to build

866
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,240
uh

867
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
we also need to build delegation for

868
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,559
bounded depth circuit which is our work

869
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,320
at asia grip 19

870
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,840
we can also

871
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,679
look that as with compression also what

872
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,960
we did before

873
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,080
is uh depth compression you know we take

874
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,039
uh

875
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,200
so our final proof don't depend depends

876
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,279
on the width but

877
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,799
so depends on the width but it doesn't

878
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,559
depend on the depth and now we are going

879
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,200
to to do the other the other thing also

880
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,440
um with compression

881
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,279
so we are going to build delegation for

882
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,039
bounded depth circuit which are these

883
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,519
objects like this very short circuit so

884
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,919
in this case it's just one level

885
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,519
um

886
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,200
we are so we are going to use the

887
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
technique of

888
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,600
our techniques at hq 19 where we chose

889
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,240
the statement of the following form so

890
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
we take the inputs and the output of

891
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
this short circuit and we commit to this

892
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
input with short commitments

893
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
and the statement we show about the

894
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,880
opening is the following so if you know

895
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,080
an opening

896
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,799
of the input commitment then you should

897
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,440
also know an opening for the output

898
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,120
commitment and this opening need to

899
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,519
satisfy some relation in this case is

900
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,240
the

901
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,120
the function of the the the

902
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,879
this short circuit applies to the input

903
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,480
so if we take

904
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,200
for example linear relations

905
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,919
um and rewrite the commitments as matrix

906
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,919
multiplication for example with peterson

907
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,679
commitment is the case

908
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,880
and we know that our input commitment we

909
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,120
know an an opening

910
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
for this commitment and then

911
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,080
the

912
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,159
the output commitment needs to open to

913
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,559
the right linear transformation

914
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,360
of

915
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
the input

916
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,279
uh

917
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,399
implies

918
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,279
that

919
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,600
c and d belongs to the image of this

920
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,279
matrix

921
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,000
but it's not hard to see that the other

922
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
way around is not true so it's not

923
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
necessarily true

924
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,600
and in our work attention 19 we

925
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,440
introduce what is called an argument of

926
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
knowledge transfer which is basically

927
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,039
that so here you're you have knowledge

928
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,960
for for c and then it's transferred to d

929
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,320
and

930
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,760
we show that

931
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,559
um using a q and a seek argument of

932
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,559
membership in this matrix

933
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,360
but also a computational assumption over

934
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,399
m which is in fact

935
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,039
a mean assumption so it's just the ddhs

936
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,719
68

937
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,719
you can show that you have this argument

938
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,800
of knowledge transfer no

939
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,199
and then you can build delegation for

940
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,520
bounded depth circuits no because now

941
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,280
you need to compute all the convenience

942
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,119
to the input and the output of each

943
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,040
level and show this argument of

944
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,000
knowledge

945
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
transfer

946
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,399
but in in this case we need to add this

947
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,320
no signaling property

948
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,079
to the r to this argument of knowledge

949
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,119
transfer

950
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,040
and we we achieved that that by

951
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,879
computing commitments to commitment so

952
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,918
competing some non-signaling commitment

953
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,800
and to many of these arguments of

954
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,239
knowledge transfer now that we have the

955
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,079
input commitment the the output

956
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,918
commitment and then the with the other

957
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,440
two commitments in the input communion

958
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
for the next level and so on

959
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,520
no um

960
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,480
so the idea now is that our extractor

961
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,640
extract a local opening for this

962
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,160
commitment

963
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
and the hypothesis is that we know an

964
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,000
opening

965
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
for this local commitment and then

966
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
the

967
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,640
the output commitment needs to open to

968
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,359
the right transformation of

969
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,040
the input

970
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
no but the thing now is that we can

971
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
extract the no scenario commitment at

972
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,359
many levels and for each level

973
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,800
you need to have

974
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,280
this statistics the statement is true

975
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,320
and now finally uh let's see how to do

976
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
with undead compression

977
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,000
now and then we have fully succinct

978
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,680
proof for any circuit

979
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,240
we start with our circuit

980
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,200
and we commit to the left right

981
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,320
output wires for each level no for this

982
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,839
for this level

983
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,240
we compute to all the left wires with

984
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
this commitment for the first level and

985
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
the same for the right wires here and

986
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,960
the same for the output wires here and

987
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,200
the same for every level no so here we

988
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
have a

989
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,079
um

990
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,520
so here we have the commitments

991
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
now we apply that compression so we

992
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,480
compute this no signaling commitment and

993
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,119
we take all these commitments and are

994
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,040
swinging into just one

995
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
short commitment the same for the right

996
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,920
wires

997
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,800
here and the same for the output wires

998
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,280
and we have a no signaling argument of

999
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,400
knowledge transfer

1000
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,160
and um well it is going to have the

1001
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,839
following guarantee so we can open now

1002
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
this commitment at many levels no this

1003
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,359
is constant size now so

1004
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,200
the arguments are just

1005
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,560
is in the end

1006
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
the the q and you seek proof which is

1007
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,800
just a constant number of group elements

1008
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
and we can locally opening these

1009
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
commitments for example to the first

1010
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,040
level and by local soundness we know

1011
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,880
that so we can extract these three guys

1012
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
and by local soundness we know that

1013
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,920
these guys are the right linear

1014
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
transformation of the input and this guy

1015
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,880
is the hadamard product of the opening

1016
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,359
of these guys

1017
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,800
and uh

1018
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,040
and so on no we can change now not

1019
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,960
extract these

1020
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
these two guys but these two guys and

1021
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,119
this guy and these guys are going to be

1022
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,920
the right uh linear transformation of

1023
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
the

1024
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
output of the opening of this guy and so

1025
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,240
on until we show that the output is

1026
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,160
consistent with the input and then is

1027
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,040
the right evaluation of the input

1028
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,400
and voila

1029
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,960
so let's summarize what we did

1030
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
so we constructed fully 16 so a constant

1031
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,000
number of group elements an argument of

1032
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
known is for p in particular for

1033
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
arithmetic circuit over some large field

1034
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,440
no so the the field that we use is so we

1035
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,520
use

1036
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,880
set q and q is the size of the group now

1037
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
the zombie linear group

1038
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,720
then importantly

1039
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
we pro we can prove soundness from

1040
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,280
static assumptions on from the situation

1041
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,400
assumption

1042
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
we haven't talked about this because

1043
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,960
this is related to the hadamard

1044
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,640
arguments if you want to base the

1045
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,119
hadamard arguments in with

1046
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,800
or with

1047
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,760
basically

1048
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,480
argument on static assumptions we need a

1049
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,119
large crs which grows quadratically with

1050
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,680
the size of the ship

1051
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,240
we get that compressions by building new

1052
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,720
gas arguments for simple languages and

1053
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
importantly they are based on static

1054
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,400
assumption and they have very short

1055
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,680
proofs they are based on

1056
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,920
on this q and you seek arguments for

1057
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,160
linear and quadratic languages and also

1058
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
we use the technique of our techniques

1059
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,119
at hlq 19 for with compression

1060
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
which were based on two assumptions and

1061
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,680
we based them on static assumptions but

1062
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,280
again the cost is

1063
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
a larger

1064
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,480
reference thing this is for the hadamard

1065
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,599
relations

1066
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,760
and but as this also happens here so we

1067
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
also here for how the modulation have a

1068
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,640
large

1069
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,560
reference string

1070
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,280
but we an open question that question

1071
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,040
that we leave open

1072
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,680
for the future is that so we can

1073
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,880
we can stay with the original proof here

1074
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,040
the the general construction here

1075
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,119
which is based on q assumption but has a

1076
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,599
short crs so now the question is that

1077
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,440
can we do the same for this one so these

1078
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
are this is based on a

1079
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
on a constant size assumption so can we

1080
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,920
base this on a q assumption and get a

1081
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,079
shorter crs and in the end the idea is

1082
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,960
to have a snark for p with linear crs

1083
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
but based on

1084
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,520
q assumptions

1085
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,640
and we leave that as an open question

1086
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,880
and the last thing we did is to combine

1087
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,800
these two things in a meaningful way to

1088
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,040
get

1089
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
to get width and depth compression at

1090
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
the same time and to get fully 16

1091
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
delegation from standard assumption

1092
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
so thank you very much

1093
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
for your time and this is the end of

1094
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
this talk
