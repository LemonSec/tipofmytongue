1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
uh hi i'm neil vitansky and i'll tell

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,480
you about my work with kabocherski on

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,840
classical bindings for appointment

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,400
commitments

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
so commitments are one of the most basic

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
cryptographic primitives that are very

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,760
often used in the design of protocols

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
and uh let me remind you what those are

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,880
exactly

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,519
so in commitments we have a sender and a

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,320
receiver that interact in two phases in

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,479
the first phase the sender commits to a

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,680
message m

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,920
and in the opening phase it can open

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
this commitment

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
and the basic properties we asked are

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,120
hiding which means that before the

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,280
opening phase the committed message is

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
hidden and binding which says that the

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
commitment can only be opened with

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
single message

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
and these properties could be either

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
computational or statistical although

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
not at the same time

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,559
in this work we are interested in

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,960
quantum commitments specifically we're

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
still thinking about committing to

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
classical messages

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
but the communication and the parties

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
are quantum

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
and as it turns out for quantum

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
commitments the question of binding

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
becomes rather complicated

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
and in particular the classical notion

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
of binding is generally considered

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,159
impossible

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,680
due to what we call superposition tax

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
specifically consider for example a

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,040
malicious sender uh who creates a

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
superposition of messages

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,119
say zero and one

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,159
and execute the on a set sender but in

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,320
superposition

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,119
then right before it opens it measures

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,520
the message register

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,520
and only then it sends the open

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,680
so

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
if the receiver is uh unitary

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,439
then the message gate is not really

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
fixed after the commitment

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,600
it is in fact uniformly random

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
and

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
there does seem to be an easy way out of

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
this

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
for example we can just have the

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,280
receiver

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
measure the entire commitment and thus

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
effectively

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,959
make the channel classical make the

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,879
commitment classical

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,599
and and this indeed works at least for

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,239
statistically by the committee

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
so what's the catch

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,120
so the point is that by forcing the

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
commitment to be classical we might be

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
missing out on features that can only be

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
achieved quantumly

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
and one own example

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,440
where quantum commitments are really

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
superior to classical ones

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
is that they can be constructed

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
non-interactively from one-way function

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,200
that is secure one-way functions

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,440
and and this is not known classically

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,840
and in fact it is subject to black box

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
barriers

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,200
however the corresponding quantum

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
commitments at least the one that we

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
have now

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
are at the same time inferior to

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
classical commitments

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
they satisfy a weaker binding guarantee

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,840
in particular the committed message is

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
not really fixed by the commitment

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,200
and this also makes them harder to use

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
and analyze

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,959
and the question is whether this price

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,400
is necessary

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
or perhaps we can have the best of both

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,799
worlds

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
so

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
in this work

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
we essentially show that we can achieve

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,159
the best of both worlds so let me tell

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,360
you about each of our contributions

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
so we first define classical binding for

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
quantum commitments which has a similar

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,680
guarantee to that of classical questions

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
and in particular the commitment fixes

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,319
the message

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,640
intuitively

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
this notion

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
can replace classical commitments in

104
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,959
applications or protocols

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,920
without really changing the proof

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
and we demonstrate this for classical

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
zero knowledge protocols like gmw

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,159
we then show

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,480
that we can actually achieve a

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
statistically binding version of this

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,199
notion

112
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,120
non-interactively from one way function

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
so we indeed get the best of both worlds

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
finally we also explore statistically

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,000
hiding version of this notion and we

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
show that is in fact impossible

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
and in this talk i will focus on the

118
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
definition

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
and the construction which are really

120
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,560
our main contributions

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,720
so let's start by introducing our

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
definition

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
and i'm going to focus on the

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
non-interactive setting although the

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
notion itself also makes sense for

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,040
interactive

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
the basic idea behind the definition is

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
as follows so we saw that if the

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,320
receiver makes no measurements then a

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
superposition attack is unavoidable

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
on the other hand we said that we don't

132
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
want to measure everything and make the

133
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
commitment entirely classical

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
so the natural thing is perhaps to allow

135
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,240
for a partial measurement

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
and the goal is that on one hand it will

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
suffice for fixing the message

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
and on the other hand

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
it will leave the commitments

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,479
sufficiently quantum to achieve superior

141
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,759
features

142
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
those superior features that we're asked

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
okay so now i'll go into the definition

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
step by step

145
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
and i'll start from the syntax of the

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
commitment

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
so

148
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,400
here the

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
sender takes us in with the classical

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
message m and perhaps some ancilla

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,479
and it outputs a quantum commitment c

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,960
together with a possibly quantum

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,318
decommitment d

154
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,919
the receiver is then going to apply some

155
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,840
unitary and measure part of the result

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
okay and this will result in some

157
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
classical string

158
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
called r

159
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
and also a residual quantum state that

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,840
we're going to call

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,280
q now let's talk about the opening phase

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
here we have a verifier

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,520
which is a quantum algorithm it takes

164
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
the message m

165
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
the the commitment state and the quantum

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
receiver state queue

167
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,280
as well as the classical measurement arm

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,080
and if everything was done

169
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
honestly

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,720
then the verifier is going to exist

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,680
okay

172
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
so

173
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
this is the

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
the syntax and now we'd like to discuss

175
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,479
the security requirements

176
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,599
namely hiding and binding

177
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,000
and actually computational binding is

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
defined here in the standard way

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,919
analogously to

180
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
classical commitments so i'm going to

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,240
focus on our notion of classical mind

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,599
so

183
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,800
here we're going to consider the

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
following experiment

185
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
in the commitment phase

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
we are given an adversarially chosen one

187
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,039
commitment called c star which is

188
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,199
perhaps created with some entangled

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
states let's call it s star which the

190
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
sender keeps for itself

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
then the receiver is applied

192
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
making its partial measurement r

193
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
and keeps the residual quantum state q

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,319
now what happens in the opening phase is

195
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,520
the following

196
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,800
so we have an unbounded quantum

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
equivocator

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,520
okay

199
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,639
and

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,120
this quantum equivocator gets those

201
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
quantum registers that were originally

202
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,759
kept by the malicious center and were

203
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
generated together with the commitment

204
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
and we also going to allow it to get the

205
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
result of the receiver's measurement

206
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
okay this only strengthens

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the the definition

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
uh it also makes sense uh without

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,380
um

210
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,000
[Music]

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
in any case the equivocator then

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,720
generates a message and star together

213
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,639
with the commitment information this

214
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,599
star

215
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
intuitively with the goal of breaking

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
whatever binding was created in the

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
commitment

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,000
so

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,958
what's exactly the the guarantee here

220
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
so the commitment should guarantee that

221
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
the equivocator basically fails and

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,959
specifically we want the measurement r

223
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,920
to fix a single message m

224
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,640
which is only a function of r the

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
classical string r the result of the

226
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
measurement so that any opening to a

227
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,440
different message m star is going to be

228
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
rejected by the verifier with

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
overwhelming probability

230
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,399
so in this sense it is classically

231
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,959
binding there's a single message fixed

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,519
by your commitment and it is impossible

233
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
to later divert from it

234
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
so this is the definition

235
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
and we think it's quite natural

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
and in fact let me mention that a

237
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,640
somewhat similar notion is considered by

238
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
bartusek at all

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,399
they don't talk about constructing it

240
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,880
but rather applying it specifically they

241
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
show that it can be used for example

242
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
in the construction of malicious

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
oblivious transfer

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
from one reflections

245
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
okay

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
okay so

247
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
now i would like to tell you a little

248
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
bit about our about our construction uh

249
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
to achieve the notion of classical

250
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,000
binding

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,959
non-interactively from one reflections

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,920
okay

253
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
so the starting point is nauru's

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,399
classical commitments from one way

255
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,880
functions which have two messages we're

256
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,680
not

257
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
non-interactive and let me remind you

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,519
what those are

259
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
so here the receiver starts from sending

260
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,519
a free n-bit random string to the sender

261
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,440
i'll call it x

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,399
and the sender is now going to commit to

263
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,040
its b2b as follows

264
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,800
it's going to use a pseudorandom

265
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
generator that expands n bits to 3 in

266
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,040
bits

267
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
it will sample a random seed for this

268
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
generator called s

269
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,560
instead the corresponding prg image

270
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
g of s

271
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
and it's going to

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,560
sort it

273
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,519
with the receiver message x

274
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
or not

275
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,920
according to the bit b okay

276
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
so if the bit b is one it's going to

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
store the receiver's message x and if

278
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
it's zero it's not going to do uh

279
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,720
anything we're not going to sort uh

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
anything and this is the the commitment

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
and the opening is simply the the b2b

282
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,200
and the seed s okay and this really

283
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
allows to verify the structure of the

284
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
commitment this is what uh the verifier

285
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,120
will do

286
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,079
um

287
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,040
okay

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,240
so this commitment uh it's easy to see

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
that uh it's hiding uh because

290
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
commitments are always pseudorandom

291
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
regardless of the big

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
um and

293
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
it is also binding as long as the

294
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,640
receiver's message x

295
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
satisfies certain properties

296
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
specifically it shouldn't be

297
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,880
the xor of any two prg images

298
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,920
and by the way we chose our parameters

299
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
prg is

300
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,480
sufficiently expanding its image is very

301
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
sparse so this is only going to happen

302
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
with negligible probability

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,279
okay

304
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,639
so let's move to our quantum commitment

305
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,079
and the basic idea is to use the fact

306
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,600
that it is one

307
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,839
to sort of derandomize the receiver

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,639
message x

309
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
so specifically we're going to do the

310
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
following

311
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,680
so we're going to have the sender create

312
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
a uniform superposition

313
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,560
over all string x all receiver strings x

314
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
and compute the corresponding normal

315
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
commitment in superposition for each one

316
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
of them

317
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
and indeed if the sender acted honestly

318
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,000
then measuring the state

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,880
is going to result in a random receiver

320
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
message x

321
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
and the proper knowledge

322
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
and the hope is that using our quantum

323
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,079
power we can also check that the sender

324
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
indeed generates a proper state

325
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
so there are a few steps we need to make

326
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,639
for this

327
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
idea to work so let's see what those are

328
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
so first of all notice that as is this

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
commitment that we created is not really

330
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,519
hiding

331
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,079
and the problem is that for example when

332
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,399
we commit to zero

333
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,839
then

334
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
the second register the random register

335
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
is completely independent

336
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,880
from

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
the x register okay verb intensive

338
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
product

339
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
and in the case that we're committing to

340
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
one we're going to be uh very much

341
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,120
entangled so this will allow us to

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
easily distinguish the two so we need to

343
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,399
do something here and we're going to

344
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,959
change the construction as follows we

345
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,440
basically aimed it for each

346
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
string x

347
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
we will use a fresh prg

348
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,560
state

349
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,279
okay and it turns out that using a

350
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,760
pairwise independent hash function

351
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
is in fact sufficient here

352
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,720
specifically we use a lemma by zandry

353
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
that essentially says that the

354
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,880
composition of drg and a pairwise

355
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
independent hash is perfectly

356
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,480
indistinguishable from a random function

357
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
given a single quantum query okay and

358
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
this state that describes our commitment

359
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,519
can indeed be generated using a single

360
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
quantum quality to such an orc okay

361
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
the more interesting part is really

362
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839
binding so what can we claim about that

363
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
so for that we have to address what kind

364
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
of measurements uh the receiver makes

365
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,880
and how the opening is verified right

366
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
and you make your two basic observations

367
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
so first if we don't measure anything

368
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
then given the b2b and the hash function

369
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
h we can uncompute the decommitment

370
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,040
measure

371
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,079
and

372
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,480
find out whether it really had the right

373
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,440
form

374
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
or not or rather whether it was close to

375
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,199
having the right form

376
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,560
the second thing

377
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,760
is that if the commitment did

378
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
in fact have

379
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,880
the right form

380
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
and we didn't perform this test but

381
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
rather measured it directly in the

382
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
computational basis

383
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
then we would simply get a proper now or

384
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
commitment right x will be

385
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
distributed like a random receiver

386
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,480
message and accordingly will get binded

387
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
the point of course is that we want both

388
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,600
of these things at the same time

389
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
so let me tell you how we're going to

390
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
achieve that

391
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,439
so

392
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,639
in our final construction

393
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
the center's commitment is simply going

394
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,360
to be the commitment we just saw

395
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,560
but repeated many times in parallel

396
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
independently

397
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,320
okay so just a parallel repetition of

398
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
the commitment that we just saw

399
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
and when the receiver gets this

400
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,560
commitment he's going to do the

401
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
following it's going to flip a random

402
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
bit

403
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
for each one of the copies

404
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
and decide whether it's going to measure

405
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
it in the computational basis

406
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
or not measure it at all just keep the

407
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,279
corresponding state

408
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,040
and

409
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,360
the the commitment then consists of the

410
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
bit and all the hashes from all the the

411
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
copies and we need to say how does

412
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
verification look like

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
so

414
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
here we're going to test that all the

415
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,040
unmeasured commitment really have the

416
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
correct the correct structure and you're

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
going to uncompute and uh

418
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
and measure

419
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,160
and uh

420
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
for the measure commitments

421
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,040
we're simply going to verify them as we

422
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,839
would verify now

423
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
okay

424
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,320
and what's going on here intuitively

425
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,279
is

426
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,279
that the correctness test

427
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
for a random subset of these commitments

428
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
essentially ensures that many more

429
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
commitments

430
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,959
were properly structured and having

431
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,319
measured them

432
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,679
or binding was kicking

433
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,400
so

434
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,199
formalizing this of course required

435
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,079
requires cares because uh

436
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,400
in an adversarial commitment

437
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
all of these parallel commitments are

438
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
really going to be

439
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,760
entangled and we don't know exactly how

440
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,640
and

441
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
the way we formally prove this

442
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
is by reduction to quantum interactive

443
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,280
proofs

444
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,880
and where we can

445
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
basically invoke

446
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,760
a general para reputation theorem for

447
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,480
quantum interactive proofs by guitar and

448
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,559
walters okay

449
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
so this is the commitment uh the last

450
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
thing i want to note about it

451
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
is that in fact

452
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,919
the commitment itself is perhaps quantum

453
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,960
but

454
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
the commitment is completely classical

455
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,039
and this is uh another advantage that

456
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,600
this commitment has over previous

457
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,039
quarter

458
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,160
okay

459
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
so

460
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
let me summarize

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
um so quantum commitments

462
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
can be uh

463
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,360
as binding as classical ones okay but at

464
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
the same time

465
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
also superior

466
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
and specifically we show that they can

467
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
be obtained non-interactively from one

468
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,760
way functions

469
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,799
and one great question is of course

470
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
which other interesting features can

471
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,039
such quantum commitments uh have

472
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
and perhaps another interesting question

473
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,240
is whether we can apply similar ideas

474
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
for example such randomization

475
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
for other primitives or perhaps in

476
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,039
totally different settings maybe in

477
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,360
complexity theoretic settings

478
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,799
okay so

479
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,600
this is it for this time thank you for

480
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
listening
