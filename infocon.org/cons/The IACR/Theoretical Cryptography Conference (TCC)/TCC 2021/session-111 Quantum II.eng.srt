[Music]

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,800
okay you're ready to go

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,560
so welcome back everyone so

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,600
we have the second quantum session today

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
and it's going to be a mostly online

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,920
session and the first talk is about

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
secure software leasing from standard

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,720
assumptions

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,880
and

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,680
thank you for the introduction i'm going

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,640
to talk about the secure software racing

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
this is a joint work with the friukki

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,079
tagawa and takashi makara from entity

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,559
secure software racing is a quantum

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,800
cryptographic primitive there are

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,039
investors who has a software and lessee

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,440
a central authority generates a common

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
reference string

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
the lesser generates a protected

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
software by using a secret key

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,479
then the lesser sends it to dynasty

22
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,759
the lessee

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,000
can learn the software on the lesbian

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,439
legitimate platform that is they can get

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,199
an output for an input

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,320
at some point the lse returns this

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,079
software to the lesser

28
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
then the lesser checks whether the

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,400
returned software is a buried list

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
software or not

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
after the lazy returned this software

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,360
they cannot run the software anymore

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
that is this software must be a quantum

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
set since we can easily copy cluster

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
information

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
there are two security notions for

37
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,960
secure software listing

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
one is finite time security

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
in this security game an adversary

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
receives the protected software

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
then the adversary tries to generate

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,878
possibly entangled bipartite states

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,599
both of them can be used to run the list

44
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,079
software

45
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
the adversary sends one state to the

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,800
lesser as a returned software

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
and uses the other one to run the least

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
software

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,959
finite time security guarantees the

50
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
returned software is not buried

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,239
or the adversary cannot run the resource

52
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,160
software on the legitimate platform

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
anymore

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,000
here the adversary is forced to run

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
software by an honest evaluation

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
algorithm

57
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,280
the other notion is infinite thumb

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,560
security

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
this is stronger than finite thumb

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
security

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,400
in this security game the adversary also

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
tries to generate possibly enzymed

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
bipartite states

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
then the adversary tries to use both

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,159
states to run the least software on the

66
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,200
resume platform

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,599
infinite time security guarantees the

68
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,480
adversary cannot use either of the two

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,399
state to run the list software

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,640
this is our result and comparison

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
finance and labor presented the notion

72
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
of secure software racing and

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
instantiate it for subclass of aviation

74
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
functions by using public key content

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
money and elderly assumptions against

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
quantum advisories

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
their scheme achieves infinite time

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
security

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
some concurrent and independent works of

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,319
our work improved the assumptions

81
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
but the function class is limited to

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,120
subclass of invasion functions

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,400
alongside achieve secure software

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
listing for broader function classes but

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
they still need public key content money

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,120
ours is the first secure software

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
listing for broader function classes

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
from standard assumptions

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
in our paper we give constructions for

90
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
pseudo-random functions and subclass of

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,879
evasion functions

92
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
but our construction can support public

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
key encryption and signature by

94
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,519
combining the technique by alan snyder

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
our construction is based on the clean

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,600
framework using software water marking

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
we can instantiate the water

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,639
watermarking part with standard

99
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
assumptions

100
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
alongside concurrently and independently

101
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,759
presented presented a similar technique

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,800
based on watermarking

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,759
we note that some works achieve security

104
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
where pilot software is not forced to

105
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,080
run by honest evaluation algorithms

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,639
lastly our construction can be achieved

107
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,440
only with classical communication

108
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,919
that is we do not need to send quantum

109
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,280
states

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,799
uh this is our result

111
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
now our so our scheme is based on the

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
scheme by announce announcer and lab

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
maker so i label it

114
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
software is modeled as a classical stack

115
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
we somehow generate a protected circuit

116
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
in the classical way and connect it to a

117
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
public key content money

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
when we return the list software to the

119
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,479
letter the list checks the quantum money

120
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,840
is valid

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
then the lesser also checks the

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
protected circuit part is correctly

123
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,600
connected to the quantum money

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
if both

125
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
are by the return of the software is

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
buried

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
when we learn the reasons of their own

128
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
legitimate platform the platform does

129
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,280
not

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
the platform does the same check as the

131
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
lesser

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
it checks both the quantum money and the

133
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
connected part

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
the crucial observation here is the

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
lesser can use their secret key for

136
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
checking the returned software while we

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
need a public key to run the list

138
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,199
software on the legislative platform

139
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
we found that we do not need the full

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
power of public key content money for

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,039
finite time security

142
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
so instead of public key counter money

143
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,600
we use two tire quantum lightning which

144
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
we introduced in this work this is the

145
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
relaxation of quantum lightning

146
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,639
in two-tier quantum writing an authority

147
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,400
generates the public key and the secret

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
key

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
anyone who has the public key can

150
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,400
generate a bolt as quantum lightning

151
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,039
there are two types of verification in

152
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
two tyre quantum lightning

153
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
one is full verification which needs a

154
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
secret key

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
the other one is same verification which

156
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,160
needs the public key

157
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
so anyone can execute same verification

158
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
however only the authority can execute

159
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
through verification

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,599
in the security game the adversary

161
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
generates potentially entangled two

162
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,360
quantum states as quantum lightning

163
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
into tire and vulnerability game one

164
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
quantum state is checked by full

165
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,479
verification using the secret key

166
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
the other quantum state is checked by

167
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,599
same verification using the public key

168
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,000
two tire unclean ability guarantees one

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,080
of the two states with the same serial

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
number is invalid

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
we can construct the software racing by

172
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
using two tire quantum lightning instead

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
of public key content money

174
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
we also use software watermarking for

175
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
the circuit protection part

176
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
alexa generates a bolt and serial number

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
and embeds the serial number and the

178
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
public key of two tire content lighting

179
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
into software by water marking

180
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
so the software is connected to the

181
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
board

182
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
when a software is returned

183
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,800
the letter extracts the embedded public

184
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
key and serial number and checks the

185
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
bold part by full verification with the

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
secret key

187
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
when your let's see then learns software

188
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,599
they extract the embedded public key and

189
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
the serial number and checks the bold

190
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,840
part by same verification with the

191
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
public key

192
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
precisely speaking we need mac to

193
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
formally prove the security of our

194
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,559
construction by add but i omit it for

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,919
simplicity in this talk

196
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
we can prove the finite time security of

197
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
our construction by using two-tier

198
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
unclaimability and unlimitability of

199
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240
water marking

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,640
the adversary generates two states

201
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
one is checked by the lesser and the

202
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
other one is on the legislative platform

203
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
suppose the first one is buried under

204
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,720
full verification and the second one is

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
valid under same verification

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,160
we consider two cases

207
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
first if the

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
extracted public keys are the same in

209
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,040
two states the adversary breaks two-tier

210
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,920
uncle nobility

211
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,120
in the second case if the extracted

212
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
public keys are different the adversary

213
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
breaks unremovability of water marking

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
since fire the software must preserve

215
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,560
the functionality of the of the original

216
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
software

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
note that this argument is

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
oversimplified since we omit the mac

219
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,518
part from this intuition

220
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,120
this is the summary of our work

221
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
all building blocks can be constructed

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
from the ql library assumption

223
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
we can also achieve status of their

224
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,760
listing with classical communication

225
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
however i omitted them in this talk

226
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,640
please see the video or paper for the

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
video

228
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
that's it thank you

229
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
thanks for the talk so i think we're

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
running a little bit out of time so we

231
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
can have the questions for you towards

232
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
the end unless someone has a quick

233
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
question while the next speaker ombre

234
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
sets up so that we can get to the

235
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
questions for your talk towards the end

236
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,279
of the talk

237
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,440
with the end of the session

238
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
so i was just uh updating that uh uh

239
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
umri unfortunately uh called me 30

240
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
minutes ago we had an accident

241
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
uh

242
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
yeah um

243
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,160
anyhow we can now do do you think

244
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
we could have your talk right now the

245
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
classical binding for quantum

246
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,240
commitments and get to this talk towards

247
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,600
the end of the session yeah so what

248
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
we're going to do anyhow because he's

249
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
not going to get here is in the hospital

250
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,560
um and since i didn't have any time to

251
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
prepare anything uh there's a talk by

252
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
michael from qcrip the five minute talk

253
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
and uh we're going to broadcast it uh

254
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
right now

255
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,519
and uh we already checked that it works

256
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,839
so no

257
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,399
worries i hope umri is

258
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,079
not serious me too

259
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,440
but uh i spoke with him on the phone um

260
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
so he's conscious uh he's sort of

261
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,720
walking

262
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
or limping i guess

263
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
but he has to get a few uh tests done to

264
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
know that

265
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,720
everything is fine uh so yeah so uh get

266
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
well from uh from here um

267
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
everyone on pcc

268
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,320
yeah so uh let me play the video and

269
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
i'll be happy to answer questions uh

270
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,279
afterwards

271
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
hello hi everybody i'm michael and i

272
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
represent uh the following work which is

273
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
a joint work with the newbie conscience

274
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
all of us are from tel aviv

275
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
um

276
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
so what we have done we started to

277
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
consider the notion of quantum

278
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
receivable soundness i don't have that

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
much time to

280
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,680
uh

281
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
recap although it was done in the

282
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
classical motion but

283
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
what we do is we consider uh resetting

284
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
attacks where the prover has quantum

285
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,760
oracle access to the verifier

286
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,720
and

287
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
he needs to cheat the verifier at some

288
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,680
session

289
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
uh the motivation that we have for

290
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
considering such a notion is to follow

291
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
this the first one is to achieve such a

292
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
security guarantee as was done in the

293
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
classical case and as takashi has

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,360
mentioned before me uh the notion of

295
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
black box zero knowledge is indeed very

296
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
important to understand and we hope that

297
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
as in the classical case understanding

298
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
more more about quantum reasonable

299
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
assignments will help us understand more

300
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
about the limitation of post quantum

301
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
black box zero knowledge

302
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,720
uh again as takashi mentioned we show uh

303
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
analog results to their uh regarding

304
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
free message and constant around public

305
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,600
coin we show that there cannot be any

306
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
black box zero knowledge uh

307
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,079
protocol that is as those are described

308
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:40,959
here

309
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,839
uh

310
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,880
and we achieve this by observing that

311
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
as in the classical case uh post quantum

312
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
black box zero knowledge and resultable

313
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
sounds cannot coexist together

314
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,440
and using test observation we use the

315
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,519
measure and reprogram techniques to

316
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
transform for example pre-message

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
protocols into classical reset of these

318
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,079
stuff into a recently sound ones and as

319
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
such there cannot be both quantum and

320
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
reasonably sound zero knowledge with

321
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
free messages or public coin

322
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
uh this is the first result we achieve

323
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
in the paper

324
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
the second result is on the positive

325
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
side we show how to construct uh the

326
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
pull of spontaneously sound zero

327
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
knowledge protocol uh for any language

328
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,440
nmp uh our protocol assumes the hardness

329
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
of quantum learning with errors and a

330
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,040
quantum polymorphic description the

331
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,680
construction is constant round uh again

332
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
zero knowledge is post quantum which

333
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
means it is uh

334
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
holds against quantum verifiers

335
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
malicious quantum verifiers and just to

336
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,040
give a little taste hey our protocol

337
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
indeed begins from the protocol of

338
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,480
concentration zero knowledge which is in

339
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
the black box from vitamin k but the

340
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,519
protocol as is is not receptively sound

341
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
even classically then we need to first

342
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,079
try to think how to transform it into a

343
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,800
classical uh recently sound protocol uh

344
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
via the actual document or paradigm and

345
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,839
then try to solve all the

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,519
technical difficulties that arise from

347
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,880
the fact that we're dealing now with

348
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,519
quantum adversaries and not uh classical

349
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,720
ones

350
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
and the last result we show is again an

351
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
analog of the classical result which

352
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
shows a connection between receivable

353
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,480
soundness and a quantum virtual black

354
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,639
box sophistication we showed that any

355
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
recently some zero knowledge protocol

356
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
for np and some kind of hardness in the

357
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,160
post quantum world

358
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,920
for example when we function

359
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,279
implies that virtual black box

360
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,720
substation

361
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
is impossible

362
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,040
this

363
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
with the construction of the protocol is

364
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
an analog result to the possibility

365
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
results that are mentioned here and also

366
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,279
i'd like to mention that if we were ever

367
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,839
to construct a better

368
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,240
like weaker assumption protocol

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
which is reasonably sound we can

370
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
immediately imply that resettable

371
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,760
that uh quantum virtual black box

372
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
society is indeed impossible and as such

373
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
trying to build for example uh public

374
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,519
coin constant from a non-black box

375
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,480
protocol

376
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
it will be as difficult as showing that

377
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
uh contour virtual background

378
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
sophistication is impossible

379
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
since we can transform it to resettable

380
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,839
sound

381
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
there is sound protocol giving uh

382
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,959
our

383
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
our compilers that we have discussed in

384
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
the first result

385
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,519
uh

386
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,920
so this is what

387
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,630
whatever

388
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,730
[Music]

389
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,079
okay yeah this was pretty fast i'll be

390
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,320
happy to answer questions now or later

391
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
uh whatever the form of this

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
first of all thanks a lot dear for just

393
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
taking care of that if you're having

394
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
totally okay if uh yeah we could have

395
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,720
sort of had to stop later but yeah

396
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,639
thanks a lot and yeah best wishes to

397
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,360
omri from everyone at tcc and any

398
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
questions from the audience or

399
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,600
i don't think there are any questions on

400
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
the chat right now

401
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,519
and maybe i can ask a quick question so

402
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
can you expand on the last part that

403
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,199
these better protocols will imply better

404
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,399
obfuscation

405
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,480
schemes you mean quantum complication

406
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,639
skills for quantum circuits

407
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
right yeah so uh no not for quantum

408
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
circuits so we're talking about quantum

409
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,639
obfuscation of classical circuits

410
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,759
okay let's

411
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
whether quantum gives you more power

412
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
maybe you can

413
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
expect you can get for example virtual

414
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,399
black box

415
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,120
uh for classical circuits but using a

416
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
quantum state so your obfuscation is

417
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
going to be a quantum state and there

418
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
are impossibility results for that uh

419
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
from the past uh year uh actually a

420
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
couple of those

421
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
and they all seem to rely on uh somewhat

422
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
strong assumptions for example

423
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
photomorphic encryption

424
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
and it's not whether this is inherent

425
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
right like in the classical setting we

426
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,279
have unconditional impossibility results

427
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,040
and really sort of like the

428
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,120
the main engine there is uh is one-way

429
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,160
functions

430
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
um so basically

431
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,680
like the basic question is can you show

432
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
impossibility of

433
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,199
obfuscation

434
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,240
using

435
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
quantum okay of like obfuscation through

436
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,519
a

437
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,959
quantum procedure um based on weaker

438
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,480
assumptions based on one way functions

439
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
or perhaps even unconditionally

440
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,079
and we point out that through this

441
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,439
connection

442
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,880
um

443
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,000
to a

444
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,280
resettable soundness um

445
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,679
you might be able to get like a

446
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,319
different path toward this uh this

447
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,880
question uh in fact in the classical

448
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,240
setting you can instantiate uh this path

449
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
but in the quantum setting at least for

450
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
now we don't know how to construct like

451
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
things like let's say a constant round

452
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,799
public coin uh zero knowledge and stuff

453
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,240
like that uh if you manage to do that

454
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
and

455
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
naturally it won't involve a

456
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
fuliomorphic encryption which sort of

457
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
automatically gives you secret protocols

458
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
uh then we would also vicariously

459
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,919
get uh stronger impossibility results

460
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,679
okay

461
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,440
okay i see i understand now i thought

462
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
that uh you were hinting that there

463
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,400
might be better constructions for

464
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,880
obfuscation schemes from sort of these

465
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
new protocols so you're saying no it's

466
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
the opposite oh it's more bad news it's

467
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,600
like

468
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,280
okay yeah but from weaker assumptions

469
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
thanks a lot me and that's wishes to

470
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,080
hungry

471
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,000
so let's move on to the third top of the

472
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,280
session and uh japan is going to sort of

473
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
keep the dogs you can please share your

474
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
slides

475
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,200
and the paper is on unifying

476
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
pre-sampling via concentration bounds

477
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,919
and the work is uh by ciao go uh

478
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,000
chipping liu uh

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,440
zan and uh please rectify uh me in case

480
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,559
i mispronounce anyone's name yes

481
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,240
thanks for the introduction

482
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
uh yeah i don't think we can see your

483
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
slides yet

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,039
okay yes yeah i'm still i'm still

485
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,840
working on this okay uh can you see that

486
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
yeah

487
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
okay okay great

488
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,120
okay yes uh thanks for the introduction

489
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
the work is about the uh unifying

490
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,480
pre-sampling we are concentration funds

491
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
so um okay let's start

492
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,679
uh okay

493
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,520
so we start by looking at a famous

494
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,080
example of practical hash function

495
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,720
char 3 and for this function the

496
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
building block is a function in the

497
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
picture

498
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
the function seems very random and

499
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
achieves pretty good performance in

500
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
practice but however it is very hard to

501
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,400
analyze

502
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
even uh for the most fundamental

503
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
properties like lesion resistance and

504
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,559
unwillingness

505
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,400
so to deal with the difficulty in

506
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,880
analyzing security belay and rock will

507
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
observe that random oracle captures most

508
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,679
railroad attacks and the proofs are much

509
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,080
simpler

510
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,559
but however security balancing idealized

511
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,679
models

512
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
uh like a random oracle model provided

513
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
essential and heuristic justification

514
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
and guidelines for their security in the

515
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,840
standard models

516
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,080
but

517
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,240
however traditional idealized model

518
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,799
failed to capture pre-processing attacks

519
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,960
the obtained bonds in idealized models

520
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,000
are inaccurate or not applicable at all

521
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
once pre-processing is allowed

522
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
and one famous example is pre-image

523
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
finding

524
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
well um when no pre-processing is

525
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
allowed it is easy to see that it

526
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,080
requires roughly zita and queries to

527
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,559
invert the image and when preprocessing

528
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
is allowed the query goes down to n to

529
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,559
the two sets

530
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,640
so let's look at the formal definition

531
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,039
of idealized models which pre-process

532
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,039
so

533
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,480
so when uh

534
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
the adversary in the random oracle model

535
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
is allowed to do pre-processing we call

536
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,039
such model auxiliary input random oracle

537
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,240
model or

538
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,840
ai rom

539
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
there are two phases in the model the

540
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
first one is called an offline phase

541
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,520
there's a unbounded adversary can

542
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
arbitrarily interact with the random

543
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,799
oracle and making unbounded queries

544
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,280
it at the end of the day it produces a

545
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,960
piece of advice of lens atoms most s

546
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
and then

547
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,600
in the

548
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
in the online phase another algorithm

549
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,159
tries to win a security game it gets a

550
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,960
device from the offline phase and the

551
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
challenge

552
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
and then it makes at most t queries and

553
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,000
the goal is to output a valid answer

554
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,159
so the reason to think about this uh

555
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
offline procedure

556
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
uh is because it captures the more

557
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,640
realistic realistic attacks or enzo in

558
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,559
other words the non-uniform attacks

559
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
and another reason is that usually it is

560
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,120
crucial to answer online queries more

561
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,919
efficiently comparing to um

562
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
more efficiently so for example a hacker

563
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
needs to like respond to a server in a

564
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
short period of time the offline phase

565
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
is allowed to take a quite a while

566
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,840
because the hash function is public now

567
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
and everybody could like spend a lot of

568
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,520
time and analyzing that function

569
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
so therefore we define the security in

570
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
the ai rom

571
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
which is simply um

572
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
the security against aspects of a device

573
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,120
and t queries

574
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,559
although the model captures the more

575
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,640
realistic attacks it is usually more

576
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
difficult to work with especially to

577
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,240
prove its sc security

578
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
so there are a couple of techniques for

579
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
analyzing security in the ai rom and as

580
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
you may tell from the title in this talk

581
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
we were all focusing on pre-sampling

582
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
which gives a simple and intuitive

583
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,120
analysis

584
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,120
so the intuition behind pre-sampling

585
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,840
technique is that although the device

586
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
can be an arbitrary function of the

587
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,520
random oracle

588
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
for now let us assume it is well

589
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
structured in other words it only stores

590
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,400
as input as pairs of input and outputs

591
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
of the random oracle

592
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,919
and therefore for an online adversary it

593
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,080
only knows this fixed coordinates but

594
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,600
nothing else

595
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,080
and therefore the security is easy to

596
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,559
analyze as long as the challenge avoids

597
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,520
this fixed coordinates

598
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
and um informally for example

599
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
serum says that the advantage of any

600
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,760
complicated advice is at most the

601
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,159
advantage of some longer but well

602
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
structured advice

603
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,760
and and let's look at the same and more

604
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
formally

605
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,320
so um we first defined the bit fixing

606
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
model well the random oracle is sampled

607
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
as follows first the outputs are

608
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
arbitrarily fixed on

609
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,280
p coordinates by the attacker

610
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
and then the remaining coordinates are

611
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
sampled by the challenger or by the

612
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,039
random oracle

613
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
and the sampling theorem says that let

614
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
epsilon be the maximum success

615
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
probability of breaking an application

616
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
in the ar wrong

617
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
then it will be at most epsilon prime

618
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,559
plus st over p well epsilon prime is a

619
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,320
maximum success probability

620
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,880
in the corresponding p bit fixing

621
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
model

622
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,520
and when p is roughly s times t then

623
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,679
epsilon will be at most two times

624
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,679
epsilon prime

625
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,000
and note that usually epsilon prime is

626
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,360
uh much easier to bond

627
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,279
and also um we note that the first one

628
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,559
is additive therefore works better with

629
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,679
indistinguishability game and the second

630
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,600
bond is multiplicative which works

631
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
better with

632
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,918
unpredictability games

633
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,840
okay and that's like the recap of the

634
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,080
classical theorem and now let's switch

635
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,880
to the quantum world

636
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,279
so in a quantum world uh random oracles

637
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,720
are the same which is the random

638
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
function drawer at the very beginning of

639
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,279
the game the only difference in the

640
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,120
interaction between algorithms and

641
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,440
random oracles

642
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
since the quantum algorithm can always

643
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
implement a practical hash function for

644
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,880
example a chart three on its own devices

645
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,120
therefore it is natural to assume it

646
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
makes superposition queries to the

647
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,440
random oracle

648
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,799
and it's also natural to define

649
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
auxiliary input quantum random oracle

650
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,080
model well

651
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
both the offline and the online phase

652
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,039
online algorithms are quantum and the

653
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,360
advice can be either quantum or

654
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,520
classical and in this work we're

655
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,679
particularly

656
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,760
interested in the case where advice is

657
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
classical and the online algorithm is

658
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
quantum

659
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,120
and therefore um

660
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
as we have seen the simplicity and

661
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
tightness of pre-sampling techniques in

662
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
a classical setting we ask the following

663
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
question can we leverage free sampling

664
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,039
techniques to the quantum setting

665
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
and in this work we answer this question

666
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
in three different aspects

667
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
first we realize that a

668
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
so-called direct leveraging is difficult

669
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,679
we show that if such a direct leveraging

670
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
would work that it implies the famous

671
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,559
aerosol and binance conjecture is true

672
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
the conjecture research said any quantum

673
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
algorithm or unstructured inputs can be

674
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
approximated on most inputs by efficient

675
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,480
classical algorithms

676
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,240
the conjecture is still quite open and

677
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,919
the best known bond is still

678
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,640
exponentially far from conjecture

679
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,320
therefore we think it is a barrier

680
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,640
and faced with this barrier we revisit

681
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,159
the pre-sampling techniques in the

682
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,400
classical setting we find that there is

683
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,960
a much simpler proof for the previous

684
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
pre-sampling theorem

685
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,279
which will redefine p-bit fixing random

686
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,600
oracle model and work out a simpler and

687
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,039
unified proof

688
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,919
with only standard concentration bonds

689
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,159
this proof gives type theorems of

690
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,880
previous works for both uh ai random

691
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
oracle model and a random permutation

692
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,600
model and this is why we also call it a

693
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,799
unifying

694
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,799
approach

695
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
and with this new definition of bit

696
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,080
fixing model we adapt it to the quantum

697
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
bit fixing model and we show that with

698
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,640
this new definition we can prove a

699
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
quantum version of the pre-sampling

700
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,279
theorem and further

701
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,039
it is optimum in the sense that it

702
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,919
matches exactly classical uh the

703
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,640
parameters in a classical bond

704
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
and finally we showed the simplicity and

705
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,840
generality of this theorem by reproving

706
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,799
previous bond and also giving the first

707
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,760
uh post-quantum noun uniform security of

708
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,960
a merkle dam got hash functions

709
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,039
and i guess that's everything i want to

710
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,120
talk about today there are a couple of

711
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
technical things but we can talk about

712
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,600
that in the in the question session

713
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,880
and thanks for your attention

714
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:57,679
[Music]

715
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,440
so maybe if i can ask a quick question

716
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,480
and uh

717
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,919
do you think these ideas would be

718
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,520
something i guess would also be okay so

719
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
you right now apply these ideas to prove

720
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,760
uh something pre-something theorems for

721
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,399
random oracles from hash functions but

722
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,320
what about some other oracle functions

723
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
could be like some cryptographic

724
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
articles that you want to say okay hey i

725
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,360
have like pre-processing access to these

726
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
oracles cryptographic articles could be

727
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
an encryption scheme could be a

728
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
decryption scheme and eventually sort of

729
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
just say okay hey i'll give you some

730
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,919
polynomial string and then ask a few

731
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,240
questions uh

732
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,679
yeah i

733
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,600
i'm not a hundred percent sure but

734
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
currently i think for these idealized

735
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
models we can uh generalize it although

736
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,399
we don't know if there's two to prove it

737
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,640
in other words like we we're going to

738
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
prove security in the bit fixing model

739
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,279
but then if you're caring about like

740
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
other models then you're

741
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,200
basically you need to bond the security

742
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
in the in the bit fixing of other models

743
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,799
which i'm not sure if that's uh easy or

744
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,240
or hard but there's like a natural

745
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,200
generalization and you can adapt this

746
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,840
whole framework into other other oracle

747
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,480
models but i'm not sure whether uh let's

748
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,559
argue this epsilon prime is easy or not

749
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,240
okay but uh won't the argument epsilon

750
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,919
prime in those cases be similar to

751
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,919
arguing that uh like here epsilon prime

752
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,600
is sort of arguing about the number of

753
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
queries or it's like for each random

754
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
oracle query writing some properties

755
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,840
with that

756
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,159
uh yes so so this so called a bit fixing

757
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,080
model would you you need to argue

758
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,240
security in the big fixing model and

759
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,159
that that that makes some difference and

760
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,559
that may seems like non-trivial i guess

761
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,159
yeah okay

762
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,120
thank you

763
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
and i would say there were some

764
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
questions on this youtube chat for

765
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,480
uh new but i would say we can get to

766
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
those all the questions if we have time

767
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,919
towards the end of the session of course

768
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,360
yes

769
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,159
yeah yeah i i i look at these questions

770
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,399
also yeah

771
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,279
as well so let's move on to the next

772
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,440
talk and the talk is on relationships

773
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,080
between quantum cp notions nissan could

774
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
you please uh share your slides

775
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,639
uh yes

776
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,360
is that is that okay now

777
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,640
yes could you start the slideshow

778
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
yes

779
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,559
is that fine

780
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,559
that's that's great so okay so the next

781
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,640
talk is by son and the doctors on

782
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,799
relationships between quantum ncp

783
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,919
notions and the paper is by torque uh

784
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,720
winston cautions issan ibrahim

785
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,840
uh jello and noel davia dominic andrew

786
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,159
and uh please correct me if i said

787
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,159
someone's name correctly but yeah take

788
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,720
it out uh

789
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,000
that was great thank you for the

790
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
introduction and uh

791
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,559
so uh we the full version of the paper

792
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,039
is available at april if this

793
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,039
presentation is really short

794
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,640
so

795
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,200
i will go uh quickly the setting that we

796
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,799
consider here we

797
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,240
we're talking about the post quantum

798
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
security in the solar position access

799
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
model when the adversary quantum

800
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,559
adversary basically has a

801
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,840
uh has a quantum

802
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,360
uh quantum access to the classical

803
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
cryptographic construction

804
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,880
uh so uh

805
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,600
in this talk we are targeting how to

806
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,600
define the cpa notions in this model so

807
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,159
basically the question is how cpa notion

808
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,080
can be defined when that the city may

809
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,559
have us for position access to the to

810
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,919
the encryption scheme and what they are

811
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,919
what is their their relationship between

812
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,440
the notions that have been deprived

813
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,760
so to to define such emotions

814
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,679
we have to fill in these question marks

815
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,440
and how adversary

816
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,279
interact with the challenger

817
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,440
and in the learning phase and the

818
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,799
challenge phase

819
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,880
and the challenge phase is is colored by

820
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,640
the red and the learning face or or like

821
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
they don't have a color

822
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,919
so first i quickly go through the

823
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,559
existing seepage notions

824
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,080
before our work

825
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,399
so there is a bonus on this definition

826
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,320
that they consider

827
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
like standard oracle access to

828
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,559
encryption in the learning phase

829
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,600
and the

830
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
classical access to the encryption in

831
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,440
the challenge fields

832
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,799
so in the challenge phase the

833
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,200
uh basically the challenge after getting

834
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,919
two messages it returned one one of the

835
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,440
encryption of one of the messages based

836
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,559
on the random bit which would be so this

837
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,279
we call it the one ciphertext return

838
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,039
actually

839
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,720
there's another definition that they

840
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,080
consider a

841
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,919
different query model it's called the

842
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,159
minimum query model in the learning

843
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,919
phase and in the in the chat in the

844
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,840
challenge phase as well so the challenge

845
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,880
phase here is quantum and giving two

846
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
quantum states row zero and row one the

847
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,240
challenge gets back the encryption for b

848
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
uh the third notion is they consider a

849
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,320
real random

850
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,559
type return type in the challenge phase

851
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,279
that

852
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,200
the basically the

853
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,919
queries are implemented as a standard

854
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,760
oracle access to the encryption

855
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,320
scheme so this this phase or

856
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,960
or included as this and then in the

857
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,760
challenge phase the challenger either

858
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,159
applies permutation before encrypting or

859
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,919
it doesn't apply and that the sales goal

860
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,519
is to

861
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,519
detect if this permutation has been

862
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,320
applied or not

863
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,080
so now the question remains or are these

864
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,480
all possible notions

865
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
and the answer is no if we

866
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,960
systematically want to answer the

867
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,159
question

868
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,320
so i will go

869
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
quickly through the options that we have

870
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
so

871
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
for the for the query models if you have

872
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,679
four options

873
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
uh to consider like the classical query

874
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,079
or standard query model or embedding

875
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,159
query mode or minimal querying module

876
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,560
embedded query model is different a bit

877
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,399
like slightly different from this

878
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,399
standard model in which

879
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,639
the alpha register here

880
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,440
is is said to be zero so the adversary

881
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
doesn't have a control over output

882
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,639
register

883
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,800
there's also a different material type

884
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,119
specifically in the classical case we we

885
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,440
have two different notions for this that

886
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,359
the challenger returns one cipher text

887
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,679
or two ciphertext or real random return

888
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,480
type so uh

889
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,079
but in the challenge in the classical

890
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,719
case these notions are all

891
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,040
equivalent

892
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
and there are a number of queries that

893
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,119
we have to consider there is a zero one

894
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,000
or a polynomial

895
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
so now if we quickly uh do the math then

896
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,480
we can see that in the learning phase

897
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
you have five uh choices

898
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,839
and in the challenge phase we have two

899
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,480
times four times three choices and it in

900
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,280
the total we have 120

901
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,599
choices for to define certain notions

902
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,599
and this is huge number of notions

903
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,440
that's really frightening to want to

904
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,160
study these notions

905
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,680
and uh so here we excluded uh some some

906
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,920
notions um

907
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
pixel that the notion is that they have

908
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,359
a different quantum queries in the

909
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,599
learning and challenge phase

910
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,920
these are our 36 notions

911
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,000
also we excluded the one time in cpa

912
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,440
notions that is

913
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
but basically there is one challenge

914
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
query only and then there is no learning

915
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,680
queries so this is the 12 motions

916
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,200
and also there are some notions that are

917
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,839
impossible to achieve it means that and

918
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,520
like any encryption scheme will be in

919
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
securing these notions

920
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,359
so if we do the mass we

921
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,160
we can get a 57

922
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
encryptions

923
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,760
like security motions

924
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,400
still it's a huge number of

925
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,680
notions

926
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
and

927
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,760
one example of such a notion is that

928
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,680
we consider for instance the minimal

929
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,839
query in the learning phase and then in

930
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
challenge phase

931
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,760
we we can stereo random return time so

932
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,599
the notion can be defined

933
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,880
uh step forward basically so

934
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,200
this is the new new notions by the

935
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
combination

936
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,640
so we started this notion then we

937
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,520
grouped them into the 14 panels

938
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,599
and we also studied relations in

939
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,240
relations between these patterns so the

940
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,839
equivalent notions are grouped

941
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,640
and

942
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,160
we have this this table as a result

943
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
and uh so you may see some red none

944
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
implication that they left as a

945
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,079
conjecture and some question mark

946
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:52,880
if

947
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,440
we we assume that we basically believe

948
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,400
the

949
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
retinal application as a conjecture

950
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,839
because we believe that this direction

951
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,880
is more likely to happen and if it does

952
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,960
i mean if we can prove firmly that it

953
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,359
does then all the open questions will be

954
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,760
resolved and the table will be complete

955
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,720
so that's that's really pleasant to to

956
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,480
look at them

957
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
also at the end of paper this we have a

958
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
discussion related to this

959
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,079
so

960
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,640
the conclusion is of the talk is we have

961
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
two notions that

962
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,119
implies all other notions

963
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,359
and uh this is uh when we consider a

964
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,359
standard query model with the real or

965
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,680
random return type or minimal query

966
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,920
model with the one side one ciphertext

967
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,680
return type

968
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,200
now we also

969
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
we base we present a scheme that's

970
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,760
secure respected to both this these two

971
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,800
notions

972
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
and since this notion together imply all

973
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,880
other notions then

974
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,599
basically we have a scheme that securing

975
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,320
all the possible 57 notions that we

976
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,720
consider

977
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,599
and also we

978
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,359
we saw that these two definitions are

979
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,560
not comparable

980
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,000
and this is our opposite classical case

981
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,520
that different

982
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
different uh

983
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
uh

984
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,119
obviously classical case basically

985
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,440
different quantum cbi notions may not be

986
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
equivalent but in the classical case

987
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,800
we

988
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,119
we know that all of them are equivalent

989
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
and i guess that's

990
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
that's the end of my talk i was fast but

991
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,240
it gets a long time do you have any any

992
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,640
questions

993
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,560
i don't have any questions on chat yes

994
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,560
and any questions from the audience

995
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
so uh just to sort of understand the

996
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,400
contributions of this work so do you

997
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
think these two uh

998
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,560
what do you mean by they're incomparable

999
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
are there schemes that are secure as per

1000
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,240
definition one but not after definition

1001
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,920
two and the same goes in the reverse

1002
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
direction

1003
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,800
yes exactly

1004
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,760
okay

1005
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,400
so we cannot relate relate them together

1006
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,320
but you have schemes that are secure as

1007
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,040
per definition a but not as insecure as

1008
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
per definition b and same the other way

1009
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,960
around so that's yes

1010
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,680
yes exactly

1011
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,440
okay and do you think a similar

1012
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,359
systematic study will be required for

1013
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,760
quantum in cpa emotions

1014
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,160
in cca emotions uh chosen scientix

1015
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,640
attacks well for for the cci notions

1016
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,960
there are there there are days which

1017
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
basically there's

1018
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
the main challenge to define that sysa

1019
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,079
notion is the

1020
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,320
when we consider the like the challenge

1021
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
queries be quantum then

1022
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,480
the the challenge here basically we

1023
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,560
don't have a way to record this this uh

1024
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,800
quantum queries and then later the

1025
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,440
decryption basically return curve or

1026
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
garbage when when that we say something

1027
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,960
is query so

1028
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,280
uh the recording for general encryption

1029
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,839
function general randomized function

1030
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,560
is not yet developed so

1031
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,720
there's only one definition uh

1032
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,839
but there are some attempt to define the

1033
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
cc nation with with the challenge

1034
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,920
queries to be quantum but still

1035
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,440
there is not immediate success of that

1036
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
so i'm afraid that defining the seaside

1037
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,280
notion with the quantum challenge phase

1038
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,920
is challenging itself

1039
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,760
i understand so the question was do you

1040
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,640
think the

1041
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,720
the lessons that you learned from this

1042
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,400
work about definitions about their

1043
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,640
quantum nct notions the similar lessons

1044
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,560
would also be used when one will be

1045
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,720
studying the cca counterparts of all

1046
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,920
these things

1047
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
as assuming suppose we have like a

1048
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,000
starting definition where the decryption

1049
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,160
oracle query access has been modeled in

1050
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,839
an appropriate way

1051
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,880
uh sorry it was a bit interrupted so i i

1052
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
couldn't get the last uh the last few i

1053
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,079
think it's just maybe we can take it

1054
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,440
offline it's not a very important

1055
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
question but yeah thanks a lot for the

1056
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,640
great i'm sorry i'm sorry i think i

1057
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,040
didn't hear

1058
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,319
we just have one more talk and we can

1059
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,680
sort of circle back to all the questions

1060
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
for all speakers towards the end of the

1061
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,520
session thanks again nissan again for

1062
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,359
the talk

1063
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,680
thank you

1064
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,520
uh can you share your slides

1065
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,599
um

1066
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,119
yes let me do that

1067
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
okay just suck

1068
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,280
okay you can see it so now we are

1069
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,680
the last talk of this session and it's

1070
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
uh work on classical binding for quantum

1071
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,760
commitments and it's a vote by neil

1072
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
danskins we cover kerosky and me is

1073
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,839
going to present

1074
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,720
okay thanks michelle uh all right so

1075
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,720
this is uh work uh with uh spika um it's

1076
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,319
about commitments

1077
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,520
and uh

1078
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,359
as you all know uh commitments are one

1079
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,560
of the most basic uh crypto primitives

1080
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,480
uh they involve the sender and the

1081
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,599
receiver is interacting two phases right

1082
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,599
um in the commitment phase the sender

1083
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,520
commits to a message m and in the

1084
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,839
opening phase it can open this

1085
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,119
commitment

1086
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,680
and the basic properties that we ask for

1087
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,760
are hiding which means that before the

1088
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,920
opening phase the committed message is

1089
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,720
hidden and binding which says that a

1090
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,040
commitment can only be opened to a

1091
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,440
single message

1092
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,359
and in this work we're interested in

1093
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,839
quantum components

1094
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,480
we're still uh thinking about

1095
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,280
committing to classical messages but the

1096
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,599
communication and the parties are

1097
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,200
quantum

1098
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,440
and as it turns out for quantum

1099
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,920
commitments the question of binding

1100
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,200
becomes rather complicated

1101
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,520
in particular the the classical notion

1102
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,359
of binding is generally considered

1103
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,079
impossible due to a simple superposition

1104
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,040
attack

1105
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,119
so you can think about running down

1106
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,160
sender

1107
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,200
in superposition over distinct messages

1108
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,119
let's say zero and one

1109
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,359
and in this case assuming that the

1110
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,200
receiver is unitary

1111
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,119
the message bit is not really fixed

1112
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,599
after the commitment in fact it can be

1113
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,720
opened to a uniformly random bit

1114
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,280
now of course there does seem to be

1115
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
an easy solution here which is for the

1116
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,800
receiver to just

1117
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
measure the entire channel the entire

1118
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,599
commitment and therefore effectively

1119
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,200
make it classical

1120
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,599
and this one did worse at least in the

1121
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
statistical binding setting

1122
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,800
so what is the catch

1123
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,440
so the point is that by forcing the

1124
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,839
commitment to be classical we might be

1125
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,400
missing out on features that can only be

1126
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,880
achieved quantity

1127
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,960
and one known example of this where

1128
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,200
quantum commitments are really superior

1129
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
to classical ones

1130
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,160
is that they can be constructed

1131
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,000
non-interactively from one-way functions

1132
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,720
quantum secure bonus functions of course

1133
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,280
and this is not known classically as a

1134
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,520
matter of fact there are black box

1135
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,760
barriers for this

1136
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,119
however

1137
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,680
the court's finally quantum commitments

1138
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,920
are at the same time also inferior to

1139
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,680
classical commitments

1140
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
for once they satisfy a weaker binding

1141
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,880
guarantee in particular the committed

1142
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,240
message is not really fixed uh they are

1143
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,040
subject to this superposition attack

1144
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,920
and this also makes them harder to use

1145
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,720
and harder to analyze

1146
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
and the question is whether this price

1147
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,280
is really necessary or perhaps we can

1148
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,240
get the best of both worlds

1149
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,040
so

1150
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,520
in this work what we show is that the

1151
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,000
answer is essentially yes we can achieve

1152
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,319
the best of both worlds and let me tell

1153
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,280
you about each of the contributions

1154
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,359
so we first define

1155
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,880
um

1156
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,720
classical binding in four quantum

1157
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,640
commitments which has a similar

1158
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,960
guarantee to classical commitments in

1159
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,040
particular the commitment fixes the

1160
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,480
message

1161
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,040
and intuitively the notion we introduce

1162
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,119
can replace classical commitments in

1163
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,760
applications without really changing the

1164
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,560
proof

1165
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,400
and we demonstrate this for example in

1166
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,599
classical zero-knowledge problems

1167
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,000
then we show that we can achieve a

1168
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,079
statistically binding version of this

1169
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,319
notion

1170
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,000
non-interactively from one-way functions

1171
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,720
okay so indeed we get the best of both

1172
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,160
worlds

1173
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,880
finally we also explore a statistically

1174
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,520
hiding version of this notion and there

1175
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,400
we show that actually classical binding

1176
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,560
is impossible

1177
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,520
now i have very little time so i will

1178
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
only tell you what is sort of the the

1179
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,480
basic idea behind the the definition and

1180
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,880
then the idea is actually very natural

1181
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,680
so

1182
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,839
basically our receiver during the

1183
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,560
commitment phase is only going to make a

1184
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,240
partial measurement

1185
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,440
and

1186
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,280
the rationale is that we want this

1187
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,319
partial measurement

1188
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,640
to be such that on one hand the

1189
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,680
commitment will turn classical enough

1190
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,000
for fixing the message but on the other

1191
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,720
hand it will remain quantum enough

1192
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,119
to achieve the superior features that

1193
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,119
we're after

1194
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,000
okay

1195
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,800
so let me also tell you just in a

1196
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,079
nutshell about our construction of these

1197
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,040
non-interactive commitments from one way

1198
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,400
functions and the construction basically

1199
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,839
derandomizes noor's commitment scheme

1200
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,079
which as you may know is a two message

1201
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,440
commitment

1202
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,400
and specifically the basic idea is to

1203
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,359
have the sender sending a single message

1204
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,040
a superposition

1205
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,680
over all receiver messages

1206
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,240
and corresponding sender messages

1207
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,880
where we derive the sender's messages in

1208
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,000
some appropriate way specifically using

1209
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,720
a pairwise independent hash function in

1210
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,520
order to derive its randomness

1211
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,760
now we're going to take this randomizing

1212
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,720
build

1213
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,280
randomized building block and repeat it

1214
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,560
in parallel

1215
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,480
many times and in our commitment phase

1216
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,280
the receiver is going to measure

1217
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,560
some random subset of these commitments

1218
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,640
and these are meant to be in our

1219
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,040
commitments that fix the value

1220
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,280
and in the opening phase we're going to

1221
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,400
use the rest of the commitments

1222
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,880
in order to test that the actual

1223
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
uh commitment that the commitment to the

1224
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,200
center stand originally was well

1225
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,319
structured or close enough to well

1226
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,839
structured

1227
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,280
um

1228
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,880
yeah so this is the

1229
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,119
uh the idea of course that analyzing

1230
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,839
this is tricky these commitments are

1231
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,000
entangled um but you can watch the the

1232
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,800
longer talk where we discuss more

1233
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,760
details

1234
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,599
so i'll end here

1235
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,920
thanks

1236
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,240
thank you very much so any questions

1237
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,760
from the audience about this youtube

1238
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,200
chat

1239
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,000
i guess not right now so this is uh

1240
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
seems like a very cool trick so do you

1241
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,839
think this idea can also be used for

1242
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,240
sort of this uh century could also be

1243
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,160
some other primitives because this seems

1244
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,839
like a i mean abstract it seems like a

1245
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,520
very general idea

1246
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,760
fun question um

1247
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,480
so

1248
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,960
it's an open question and uh we've been

1249
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,760
thinking about it and we don't have any

1250
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,000
good answers yeah so i invite you to

1251
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,160
think about it as well you know perhaps

1252
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,599
like uh um a natural uh candidate is for

1253
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,680
example zaps right like turned into

1254
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,119
exactly absolutely not interactive

1255
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,079
one essential difference is that zaps

1256
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,240
don't have like an opening phase

1257
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,119
uh

1258
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,440
and we're using here the opening phase

1259
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,880
where there's no secrecy left whatsoever

1260
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,359
in a very strong way and and that that

1261
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,200
is the barrier there i don't know maybe

1262
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,280
there's a way to to circumvent it it's

1263
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,000
an excellent question

1264
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
wonderful okay so if there are no

1265
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,240
questions uh thanks a lot near again and

1266
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,040
uh

1267
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,359
[Music]

1268
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,079
so

1269
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,280
at this time you would like to invite

1270
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,319
anybody who would like to ask a question

1271
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,920
in session

1272
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,559
and uh so uh maybe i can sort of circle

1273
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,240
back to your day if you're still around

1274
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,400
i had like a quick question for you

1275
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,000
yeah

1276
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,720
so do you think uh the quantum lightning

1277
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,640
schemes they were initially proposed as

1278
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,240
an interesting abstraction to build

1279
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,599
quantum money as well and sort of

1280
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,440
applications towards quantum money so

1281
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,720
you have like an interesting weakening

1282
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,160
of quantum lightning do you think you

1283
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,440
might be able to

1284
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,160
sort of also get one uh maybe not public

1285
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,000
or publicly quantum money but very with

1286
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,200
very weak unforgivability property

1287
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,079
from these ideas because uh your quantum

1288
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,760
lightning scheme only relies on

1289
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,839
classical assumptions or uh only on sort

1290
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,280
of uh learning whether there is an other

1291
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,720
standard assumptions can you use these

1292
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
ideas to also build quantum money

1293
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,800
schemes though not fully publicly going

1294
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
to money but only for a very restricted

1295
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,160
class of forgery attacks

1296
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,040
uh

1297
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,480
yeah

1298
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,280
it

1299
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,720
may be possible but i don't have a good

1300
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,160
idea for now

1301
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,800
so yeah it's it's a good open question

1302
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,680
to

1303
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,480
to find um another application of this

1304
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,880
idea like uh tutorial

1305
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,200
uh something yeah like

1306
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,000
maybe

1307
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,720
two different writing might have some

1308
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,599
other another application so yeah

1309
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,319
but i don't have any good uh

1310
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,720
idea so far yeah

1311
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,559
okay thank you and still one more

1312
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,839
follow-up to

1313
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,240
your talk it's just uh you i think you

1314
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,200
used relied on and also the other uh the

1315
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,119
current work relied on the ideas of

1316
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,240
watermarking uh software watermarking as

1317
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,000
a particular primitive to sort of

1318
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,160
classically bind come into the

1319
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,000
uh or classically watermark the the

1320
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,119
circuit so but i think uh the the ideas

1321
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,280
that over there used were the original

1322
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,559
definitions of water marking do you

1323
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,160
think there has been recent work in

1324
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,520
which the notion of water marking has

1325
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,359
been strengthened to a traceability

1326
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,200
properties that those particular

1327
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,040
traceable primitives can also be used to

1328
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,160
prove certain stronger properties about

1329
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,800
uh software using if we use those

1330
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,960
particular ideas

1331
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,680
oh sorry i i didn't uh get to you all

1332
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,800
yes so

1333
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,240
stroke

1334
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,559
so i'm simply asking currently when you

1335
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,000
are using watermarking inside your

1336
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,720
schemes you're using the the uh the

1337
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,400
watermarking definitions that were

1338
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,800
defined for the unremovability games

1339
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,240
recently there has been a push to sort

1340
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,319
of move from watermarking to traceable

1341
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,839
primitives where you can have like

1342
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,000
stronger properties so do you think if

1343
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,839
you sort of rely on traceable primitives

1344
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,040
then you might be able to prove even

1345
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,200
stronger properties about the resulting

1346
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,720
software reasoning schemes or do you

1347
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,640
think maybe there are more fundamental

1348
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,599
gaps

1349
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,240
if you want to strengthen them further

1350
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,640
it's a it's very good question so

1351
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,040
i also tried to extend the our

1352
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,599
idea to the some three for example

1353
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,480
printed but

1354
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
one one uh

1355
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,559
obstacle is uh

1356
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,160
uh

1357
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,119
we

1358
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,599
in in the in the

1359
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,000
second software racing uh

1360
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,839
setting uh

1361
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
the rest use

1362
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,880
only secret key and uh sorry

1363
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,400
oh so

1364
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,119
the last you cannot use secret key

1365
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,640
so it says

1366
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,119
i think it is a problem

1367
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,079
uh to extend uh our idea to

1368
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,880
uh through addressing primitive

1369
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,800
but

1370
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,680
i don't i'm not sure whether it is a

1371
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,800
fundamental obstacle so

1372
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,920
uh

1373
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,800
maybe we can uh overcome

1374
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,440
the issue the issue and uh

1375
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,280
we can achieve some

1376
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,520
uh

1377
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,400
tourist stressing version of the of the

1378
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,440
printed so yeah it's a good uh

1379
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,440
application i think

1380
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,400
