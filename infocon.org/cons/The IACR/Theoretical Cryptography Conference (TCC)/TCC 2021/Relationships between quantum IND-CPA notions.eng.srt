00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,799
hello everyone i am sonia brainia

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,319
research at the university of block

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,359
support

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,040
i will tell you about the research

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
strategy of the relationship between

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,240
quantum and distinguished cpa emotions

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,640
this is joint work with uh

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,439
custom topiar forum

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
the full version of our paper is really

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
good at different

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
for the rest of the presentation i will

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,320
turn off my videos using my comments on

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,039
the

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
texts in the slides

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,880
i'm sorry for that

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,840
okay

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,239
so uh i first give you a setting that we

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,760
consider here

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,800
often post quantum setting refers to the

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,160
setting in which

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,120
the quantum adversary tries to attack

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
the classical geographic constructions

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
but the communication

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
between adversary and

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,600
this class of primitives

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,440
is class

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,920
obviously the computational problem

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,360
using this cryptographic primitive has

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,880
to be quantum hard

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,839
we can consider

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,479
we can consider more adversarial setting

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,520
in which

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,920
quantum adversary is allowed to make

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
superposition queries with a classical

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,159
cryptographic constructions

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,159
obviously this

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
setting has some consequences

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
first that it might break the security

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,000
of some

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
cryptographic schemes and also we need

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,439
to revisit the security

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,798
notions in this cell

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,720
and see how

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,600
the notion can be defined considering

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,399
this adversarial superposition groups

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
in this talk we look at the quantum cpa

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
notions

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
and design

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
i recall the classical cpa notion for

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,280
symmetric encryption schemes

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
so the notion consists of two phases the

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
learning phase and the challenge phase

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,239
in the learning phase

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:20,840
the

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
adversary inquiring

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
squaring the

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
the encryption roku

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
and then the challenge phase adversary

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
supports to

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
some some challenge messages

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
and uh

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
the challenger

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
replies to these messages

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
depending on the random

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
and the adversary's goal here is to

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
guess

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,640
this pdp that is chosen by the charge

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,119
and adversary wins if it gets right

69
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,800
but depending on how the

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
depending how

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
the

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
challenge phase can be implemented there

73
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,040
are

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
three possible

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,480
classical indistinguishable cpa

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,480
notions so the first way of implementing

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,560
the charge query is that that bracelet

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,519
sends

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
to message m0 and one and receives back

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,959
the encryption frame b and encryption

81
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
mv4 for random b2b we call these two

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,519
ciphertext return

83
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,480
another way of implementing this is that

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
after receiving back you know after

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
again after receiving

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,799
m0 and one

87
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,519
from

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,799
the adversarial challenger basically

89
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
the challenger

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
sends the encryption of mb to random

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
only it sends one cyberfix we call this

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
one ciphertext return

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
the third way of implementing a

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,760
challenge query is that that mercedes

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
sends a message m

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,959
and it receives back in either

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,000
and or encryption of a random message

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,519
we call this

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,280
real random return type

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
it turns out that all

101
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,160
these notions are occurred in the

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
classical settings

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
now there's the question that may arise

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
is that

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
how quantum counterpart this initiation

106
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
can be defined

107
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,919
what are the

108
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,320
relationships

109
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,280
how they are related together

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,679
we're trying to answer this question

111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,880
so in order to define the cpa notion

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,320
quantum setting

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
in a setting that we consider

114
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
adversarial superposition queries we

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,199
need to fill in these question marks

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,039
i

117
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,680
first go through the existing report of

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
cpa emotions

119
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
first is the bonus zone is definition in

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
which

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
they implement encryption queries in the

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,479
learning phase using the standard

123
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,759
oracle

124
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
model

125
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
so

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
and the the challenge queries of our

127
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,280
classical with the one ciphertext return

128
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
type

129
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
so the standard way of implementing your

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
classical function quantum device is

131
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
that

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
and this way that there's two register

133
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,039
one is for input and the other for the

134
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,360
output and the evaluation of the

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,319
function

136
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
here is the encryption function and the

137
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,520
input register is stored on the outward

138
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,850
wrist

139
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,949
[Music]

140
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
so here's the image of the phone and

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
definition so in the learning phase

142
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,680
there

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
there is a

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
standard oracle

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,639
access

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,080
to the encryption

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
oracle

148
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
and in the challenge phase there's two

149
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
classical message

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,560
and

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
the city gets back encryption and b for

152
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,840
random

153
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
b2b and of course adversaries tries to

154
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,039
guess this atp

155
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,319
another definition is

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,120
that they use a minimum query model in

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
both

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,120
challenge

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
phase and the learning phase

160
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
and then the challenge phase the

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
challenge query is implemented as a one

162
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
cypher text return type

163
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,080
so minimal query model is different from

164
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,120
standard query model in which

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,039
there's only one register and it's an

166
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
input register and that let's say gets

167
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,840
back

168
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
the evaluation of the encryption

169
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
function and this information

170
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,000
as a as an output

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
this is the way that the minimum query

172
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,280
model is defined

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,639
excuse me

174
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,960
uh here is the image of their definition

175
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
that is the learning phase the queries

176
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
or implements that the minimum query

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
model and then the challenge phase the

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
adversary

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
chooses to quantum messenger or zero and

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,160
over

181
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,599
and the

182
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
challenger

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
sends the encryption of row b

184
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
and of course that that the c tries to

185
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
get the speed b

186
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
this is how the challenge queries are

187
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
implemented

188
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,479
so depending on the bit of b either we

189
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,960
swap these two register or

190
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,479
or we don't

191
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,120
if the b is zero then we get by

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
encryption for zero or if

193
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
b is one then we get back encryption of

194
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
four one row zero one can be entirely

195
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
here

196
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,400
the third definitions

197
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,039
they use

198
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,400
standard query models

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
with the real random return type in the

200
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
challenge phase so both the learning

201
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,320
phase and the challenge rate is

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
controlled

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
and

204
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,839
in the

205
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
it's implemented in the standard oracle

206
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,479
model

207
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
here is the image of their definitions

208
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
in the learning phase

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,360
we have

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
standard

211
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
local access

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
to the encryption oracle

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
in the challenge phase the adversary

214
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,000
outputs two register

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
one for the input and the other for the

216
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
output

217
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
and uh it gets back

218
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
uh basically

219
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,839
uh m and y

220
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,160
xor encryption of

221
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
i n when b is one and

222
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
encryption of m

223
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,880
when pi is zero so either either the

224
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
challenger apply a permutation to

225
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,519
importance is that

226
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
or it doesn't before before

227
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
encrypted

228
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,160
and the adversary goal here is to guess

229
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
if this random permutation has been

230
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
applied to the input register or it

231
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,279
hasn't

232
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,839
now

233
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,160
we may ask the question

234
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,839
are these all possible definitions

235
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,360
and the answer for this question is no

236
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
if you systematically answer

237
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
so

238
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,600
you will see that

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
the possible notion

240
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,160
the possible definition for a quantum

241
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,839
cpa option

242
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
or huge

243
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
so let's look at

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
the different ways that we can we can

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
define the quantity by notions as you

246
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
saw in the previous slides

247
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
the queries for the encryption oracle

248
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
can be implemented in different ways

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
so

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,160
it can be classical query

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,320
the input of x the classical input x

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
and then we get that the sale gets back

253
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
the encryption of this message

254
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
or it can be implemented as a standard

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,399
query models

256
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,160
or minimal query model and also

257
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
it can implement as embedding query mode

258
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,600
in which

259
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,399
the

260
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
output register

261
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
is

262
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
always zero

263
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
so the difference between the embedding

264
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,279
query mode and the standard coding model

265
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,640
is that

266
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,760
here

267
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
uh the output register in the zero in

268
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
the embedding query model but in the

269
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,760
standard query model the output register

270
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,800
can be

271
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
chosen

272
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,279
by adversary so this y can be chosen by

273
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,000
adversary

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
also you you sign the previous slide

275
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
there are different ways to implement

276
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
the challenge queries

277
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
and there are different return types

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
namely one ciphertext return two

279
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
ciphertext return

280
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,160
and read or random 10 types

281
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
in addition

282
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
the number of queries matters

283
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
so the number of codes can be zero one

284
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,040
more polynomial number of cracks

285
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
so now we can

286
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,200
we can

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
theoretically

288
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,639
calculate all possible definitions

289
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,279
and for the learning queries

290
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,959
we have five choices

291
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
and for the challenge queries we have

292
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,839
two times four times three choices

293
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
and if we do the math

294
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
we we get 120

295
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,839
notions

296
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,880
possible motions

297
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,959
this is really frightening if you want

298
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,920
to get to study these notions and also

299
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,839
study the relations between them

300
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
we excluded

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,959
some definitions also some of the

302
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,160
predictions are possible to achieve so

303
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
excluded notions are

304
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
the notions that have different quantum

305
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
queries in the learning phase and the

306
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
challenge rates

307
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
these notions

308
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
the 36 notions of of this category

309
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,440
of course well we consider this notion

310
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,680
to be exotic but of course this is our

311
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,519
in addition there are some notions that

312
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
correspond to the

313
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,920
one-time cpa notion that there's only

314
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,880
one challenge query

315
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,000
there are 12 notions of this category

316
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,600
and the impossible security notions or

317
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
15 notions

318
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,959
that

319
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,240
they cannot be achieved

320
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
with any encryption scheme in other way

321
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,320
any encryption scheme is insecure with

322
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
respect to distortions

323
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,600
so if we do the mass then we get 57

324
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
notions left

325
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
to study

326
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
[Music]

327
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
still this number is huge

328
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
to

329
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,079
basically figure out all the relations

330
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,719
between them

331
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,519
i gave you an example of such notions

332
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,839
uh for instance if we combine the

333
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,240
minimum recurring model and the real

334
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
random return type

335
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
then

336
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
we get this

337
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
definition

338
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
shown in the image

339
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,639
so the learning curve is all implemented

340
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,920
as a minimal

341
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
query models and then the challenge

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
phase that per say

343
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
basically adversary

344
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
chooses

345
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
one register one the input register and

346
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
send it to the challenger and the

347
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,880
challenger

348
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
either apply or under permutation to do

349
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,399
this register or it doesn't

350
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,120
and then encrypt this register after

351
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,639
after this

352
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,920
so the adversary's goal is to

353
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
to guess if this fermentation has been

354
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,720
applied to the message or it hasn't been

355
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
planned

356
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
so all the community all the all the

357
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,720
other combination can be defined

358
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,360
similarly

359
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
so we study this

360
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
57 possible notions and

361
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
we group the equivalent notions

362
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,120
together

363
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,920
and this resulting

364
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,800
to

365
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,959
14 panels so these 14 pounds consists of

366
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,839
notions that are

367
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,199
equivalent and we studied relations

368
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
between these 14 patterns so the

369
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
implication and the non-implication

370
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,279
between these 14 patterns

371
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,399
this is a table of our results

372
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
excuse me

373
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
so um

374
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
there are some

375
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,240
slots that have a question mark also

376
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,120
there is some retinal implications

377
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
so this this these are the open

378
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
questions

379
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
uh and the recompen retinal implications

380
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,839
are

381
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,079
conjectures in the paper

382
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,759
we gave a discussion about this and we

383
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,360
basically we discussed why

384
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,560
we

385
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,000
consider

386
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
this direction as a conjecture

387
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,920
and we

388
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,720
we basically think that this direction

389
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
called

390
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
the non-implication basically hold

391
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,839
and also we show that if this

392
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,720
implication

393
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,920
hold in this conjecture hole

394
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,079
then all the open question can be

395
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,000
resolved can be solved by transition

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,880
so the table will be complete

397
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,839
if

398
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,839
there's not a return application

399
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
also we gave reason why this this might

400
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
well the non-implication is more likely

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to

402
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,400
so we reached the last slide of

403
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,720
my presentation

404
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,799
uh here i give you some conclusions

405
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,720
of this table so that we

406
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,559
got here

407
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,880
and uh i skip also

408
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
many of the conclusions also i skip the

409
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,799
techniques that i've been using

410
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,760
so as a first

411
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
first conclusion is that the two

412
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,760
definitions

413
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
imply all other definitions together and

414
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
these two definitions are

415
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,520
the standard query model with the real

416
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,280
random return type in the challenge

417
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,400
phase

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
and the minimal query model with the one

419
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
cipher text which entire challenge

420
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,000
phrase so here both the challenge

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
phase and the learning phase of

422
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,080
implemented quantum

423
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
quantumly

424
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
and

425
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,039
one is with the standard coding model

426
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,240
and one

427
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,150
minimum

428
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,179
[Music]

429
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,039
we also present a scheme that secure

430
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
respect to both definition

431
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
and this means that

432
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
this scheme is secure with respect to

433
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
all 57

434
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,039
definitions

435
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
we also show that these two definitions

436
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,840
are not comparable

437
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,559
the

438
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
definition one and two are not compiled

439
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
and also opposite to the classical case

440
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
different quantum of the secure cpa

441
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,918
notion may not be equivalent

442
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
i think the presentation is finished

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,280
thank you a lot for listening
