00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,240
hello everyone i'm susan kiyoshima from

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,000
intt research

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,480
i'll talk about my work about black

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,800
boxing possibilities up to around three

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
zero knowledge and strong write

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
so the focus of this work is the proof

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,119
of privacy of interact-proven argument

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,760
so in this work we cause the indirect

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
proof and argument that satisfy not only

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,039
completeness and soundness but also some

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
kind of security against cheating

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,599
verifier

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
so the most important global privacy

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,960
notion in cryptography is of crucial

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,680
knowledge which guarantees that for any

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,719
malicious verifier exist assimilator

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
such that the view that will be computed

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
by the simulator is indistinguishable

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,520
from the view of the verifier if we

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,120
interact with approval in a real

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,600
interaction

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,840
so a good point about zero knowledge is

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,960
that it guarantee really strong security

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,359
and because with powerful security zero

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,438
knowledge has been used in a huge number

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,600
of applications in cryptography

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
however a problem about zero knowledge

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,680
is that it is too strong to achieve in

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
two rounds

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
so in particular it is known that the

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
two-round terminology proof and argument

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
cannot exist for any not-to-be languages

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
and this impossibility hold even when we

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
consider non-black zero knowledge

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,799
so to to avoid this impossibility uh

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,119
previous works have considered several

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,680
weak proof of broadband notions that are

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,240
weak enough to avoid the prosperity but

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
strong enough to be used in many

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
applications

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,799
so the most well-known example of such a

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,600
weak purpose notion is witnessing

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,119
distinctionability

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,520
which guarantees that for any statement

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
and any two witnesses the proof

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,759
generated with the first witness is in

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
distinction from the blue general with

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
the second witness

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,799
so deborah is indeed much weaker than

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,520
zero knowledge for example it does not

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,599
guarantee any security when we consider

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
language with a unique witness

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
but still dabura is known to be useful

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
as a building block and in addition it

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
is known that the wa can be achieved in

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,720
two round under standard assumptions

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,319
and as as in write there are several

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
more examples of weak purpose notions

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,959
and basically all of them are stronger

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,560
than the bright but weaker than their

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
knowledge

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,400
and in this work we focus on two of them

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
a strong wi and the weak zero knowledge

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
so first what is the external knowledge

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,239
roughly speaking weak zero knowledge is

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,000
obtained by switching the order of

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
quantifier into the definition of zero

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
knowledge

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
so recall that the standard zero

70
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,239
knowledge requires that for anybody for

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
yet there exists a simulator such that

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
uh for any distinguishes the leo and

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,599
simulator and distinction

74
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,400
so in contrast with zero knowledge only

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,959
requires that for any verifier identity

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,519
extinguisher with the existing simulator

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,120
such that real and simulation and

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
distinction

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
so the difference from standalone

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
knowledge is that now the simulator is

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
allowed to depend on the distinguisher

82
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,319
so in implications week zero knowledge

83
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,879
is useful when for example it is used as

84
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,879
a building block of some large protocol

85
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,120
having some

86
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,799
indistinguishability functions

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
and this is because

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,120
in such applications typically we only

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
need to show that the output reset and

90
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,599
the intermediate hybrid doesn't change

91
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
when we switch earlier zero like

92
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,599
execution to simulation

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
and so by considering such a hybrid that

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
is distinguished

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
we can replace the standard zero

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,720
knowledge with a weak zero knowledge

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
and next uh what is strong double i

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
roughly speaking a strong double

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
guarantee that the approved about two

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,319
indistinguishable statements are also in

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
distinction

102
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,959
so specifically it guarantees that for

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
any two distribution of a statement

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
within a sphere

105
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
if a statement

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,240
if statement chosen from these two

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
distribution are indistinguishable then

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
a proof generality for this statement

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
are also in distinction

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
so a key difference from a standard

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
abroad is that the strong double is

112
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
meaningful even when we cause the unique

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
witness relation

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,240
and so

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
wi can be strong wi can be used for

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
example to prove statement about

117
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
statistically binary commitment

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
so in previous works it has been shown

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,800
that we can obtain two round

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,199
construction for both weeks teronauts

121
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,840
and strong double a and in particular to

122
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
round construction obtained both in the

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
derivative setting and the standard

124
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,639
non-derivative setting

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,479
where in the standard settings the

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
statement effects at the beginning of

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320
this protocol whereas in the related

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
settings the statement is chosen by the

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
approval in the last round of the

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,000
program

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
and what is important about these two

132
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
settings is that the deleted

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
is not strictly stronger than the

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
standard non-derivative setting and this

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
is because although the delay different

136
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
setting consider sounders against

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
stronger cheating grouper who chooses as

138
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
a statement to prove in the last round

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
adaptably

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
it consider private promise and get the

141
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,199
weaker cheating verifier if we need to

142
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,039
choose the first round message without

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
knowing the statement

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,919
so uh when we create the result in these

145
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
two settings we need to consider them

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
separately

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,720
and also these exact existing projected

148
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,639
results about two-round construction or

149
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
literary grade a weak point about them

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
is that all of them are based on super

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
bombing head assumption such as

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
assumption against the subjects of them

153
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,840
adversary

154
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
and this is in contrast to the case of

155
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
the standard double eye because for

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,479
standard abroad we have we have protocol

157
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,080
with two rounds and the polynomial had

158
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
assumptions such as the interpreter

159
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,638
publications

160
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:25,840
so

161
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
uh in this work we study phrases the use

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
of a superpower hardness is necessary

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
for two round weeks of knowledge and

164
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
strong wa

165
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
now uh let me explain our result

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
so at a high level we showed that it is

167
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,199
impossible to obtain two round weak zero

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
knowledge and strong double using

169
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
standard techniques and the standard

170
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
polynomial solutions

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
so to explain this result more formally

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
we first need to formalize what standard

173
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,199
techniques understand the assumption

174
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,160
mean

175
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
and in this work we will we formalize

176
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
them by using the notion of blackboard

177
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
reduction and fortify assumptions

178
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
respectively

179
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,919
so what is a fortified assumption

180
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,599
so roughly speaking

181
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,400
a

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
assumption is called fortifiable if it

183
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
is modeled as an interactive game

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
between a polynomial time challenge and

185
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,160
the polymer time adversary

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,240
so you you can easily check that

187
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,840
essentially any assumption that is

188
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
considered standard in cryptography is

189
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
indeed for survival

190
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,560
and the example include huawei function

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
collision rigid hash function and the

192
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,000
rsa atdh and the lw assumptions

193
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,240
so next what is a proper reduction

194
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
so first consider the case of soundness

195
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
and consider the setting where we are

196
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
trying to prove the soundness of some

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
interactive argument based on some

198
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,639
assumption

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,599
then a proper reduction for soundness is

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,919
a polynomial time oracle machine such

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
that for any cheating proverb that

202
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,319
breaks the soundness of the protocol

203
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,160
the reduction can break the underlying

204
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
assumption by using the cheating probe

205
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
so essentially the reduction is blackbox

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
in the sense that it uses the cheating

207
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
global as a blackbox

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
and of course proper reduction can be

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
defined for other security notions as

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
well and the particular proper reduction

211
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
for stronger boy can be defined

212
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
similarly

213
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
and i know that the black production

214
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
used very widely in cryptography and

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
actually almost all secret proof in

216
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
cryptography use proper reduction in

217
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,719
this implicitly

218
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240
now i'm ready to explore result

219
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,560
and let me start from the case of a weak

220
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,279
zero knowledge

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
first i know that the prosperity of the

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
three-round blackboard zero knowledge

223
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
also hold four weeks on knowledge in the

224
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
standard setting

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
so we already have a proposing

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
possibility for to run week zero

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
knowledge in the standard non-deleted

228
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,040
non-deleted settings

229
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
and in this work we give a black box

230
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
importantly in the directive setting

231
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
and in particular we assure that the

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
two-round weak cell knowledge is

233
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
impossible if soundness is approved by

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
blackboard reduction vessel force

235
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
assumption

236
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,440
and i know that this results hold even

237
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
when non-proper techniques are used in

238
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
the proof of weak terminology

239
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,880
and next let me explain a result about

240
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
strong wi

241
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
so first we consider the standard

242
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
setting and we show that the two run

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
strong wi in the standard non-delivery

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
setting is impossible if strong double

245
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
is proved by blackboard reduction best

246
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
vessel force assumption

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
and this without hold even when number

248
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
of class reduction are used in the proof

249
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
of soundness

250
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
next

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,040
we consider the delay depend setting and

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
we showed that to run strong double i in

253
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
the 3dp setting is impossible if either

254
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
strong wi is proved by proper reduction

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
based on voltage assumption and because

256
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
the protocol that have public

257
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,399
verifiability

258
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,440
or

259
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
uh both soundness and strong double i

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
it's proved by proper reduction based on

261
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
force assumption

262
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
so uh in this world we showing

263
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,839
prosperity for the guess that the strong

264
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,600
wri is proved by proper reduction

265
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
but i need to know that this result

266
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
actually requires the proper reduction

267
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
for strong double a black box in a

268
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,200
strong sense

269
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
and in particular which we require that

270
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,240
they satisfy property called oblivious

271
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,680
obliviousness

272
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,120
which is defined as forward

273
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
so requires that the instrument wri we

274
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,640
compare two proofs where the statement

275
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
sequence example from two difference

276
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
distribution

277
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
so when we consider malicious verify

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
against random y we also need to specify

279
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
from which distribution the statement

280
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,399
witnessed the sample

281
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,320
and then roughly speaking a proper

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,880
reduction is called oblivious if it is a

283
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
black box not about the verifier but

284
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,399
also about the distribution

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839
so in particular we required for any

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,480
two distribution of statement weakness

287
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,519
and for any verify against one double a

288
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
if the verifier

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
breaks a strong divide with respect to

290
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
these two distribution

291
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
then

292
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,079
the reduction breaks under an assumption

293
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,519
or

294
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
it distincts the distribution or by the

295
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,920
statement

296
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,680
so uh

297
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
the only additional installation that we

298
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
put here is that the single reduction

299
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
work for all distribution

300
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
and this destruction is actually pretty

301
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
natural and the particular order

302
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,480
reduction that we know for strong double

303
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
eye satisfy this illustration because we

304
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
currently don't know any techniques that

305
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,440
use number of access to the distribution

306
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,639
in non-terminal way

307
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
so even even with this research this

308
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
restriction we believe that our

309
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,720
impossibility results are still

310
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
meaningful

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
okay so these are our results so next

312
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,320
let me explain what a result implies

313
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
first uh the bad news is that to obtain

314
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
two round protocol under polynomial hard

315
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,000
assumption a number of number of

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
techniques are necessary for both the

317
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,920
case of weak zero knowledge and the case

318
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
of stronger y

319
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
and in the inverse derivative setting

320
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,920
and the strongest standard

321
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,599
non-derivative do not non-delayed

322
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,160
setting next uh good news is that uh two

323
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
round wigs are knowledgeable on the boy

324
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
and the pulling head assumption is still

325
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,839
not ruled out

326
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,959
and

327
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
this is because it might be possible to

328
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
avoid the impossibility by using a

329
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,079
number of acts number of techniques

330
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,480
so in particular the positive result by

331
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,760
vitansky kuranam penis uses a number of

332
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
number of techniques for proof of

333
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
privacy in the standard setting

334
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
and even the currently the techniques

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,839
are based on superpower harness

336
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
we do not know whether the use of super

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
point hardness such as setting is

338
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
essential so it might be possible to

339
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
obtain positive result in such a setting

340
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,639
by improving the techniques

341
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,880
all right so in the rest of this talk uh

342
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
i'll explain our techniques

343
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
and let me first explain the techniques

344
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,600
for the for the result of weakness and

345
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,760
knowledge and then explain the technique

346
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,839
for the result of strong wri

347
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,639
so for we for weak zero knowledge uh we

348
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
will tell our impossibility in two steps

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,720
so in the first step we use the result

350
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,279
by john lewis and the first to observe

351
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
that the weak cell knowledge employ

352
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
another weak hormonal knowledge called

353
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
the typical zero knowledge

354
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
so the precise definition of typical

355
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
drug marriage is not important for this

356
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,680
talk and what is important is that the

357
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
tips from zero knowledge is defined with

358
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
the same of the quantifiers as the

359
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
standard zero knowledge namely it is

360
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
defined in the form of for any verifier

361
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
there exists a simulator such as only

362
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
for any distinguished program

363
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,279
then

364
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,680
in the second step we observe that the

365
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
sense uh typical knowledge is defined

366
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
with the same order of quantifiers as

367
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,839
the general knowledge

368
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,240
we obtain a blackboard possibility of

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,279
two round

370
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
the tips on their knowledge relatively

371
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,320
easily by using techniques using the in

372
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
previous proposing prosperity of other

373
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
durant protocols such as toronto special

374
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,480
knowledge or snack

375
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,079
so uh

376
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,839
actually the proof of this result does

377
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
not use many new techniques uh

378
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,839
essentially the main point is that it is

379
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
already known that the order of

380
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
quantifier in the definition of weak

381
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,279
zero knowledge can be switched back to

382
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,880
the normal order

383
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
so in this work i want to explain the

384
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,519
techniques of the results in more detail

385
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,760
and the last in the rest of this talk i

386
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
will focus on explaining our technique

387
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,399
for proving the prophecy prosperity over

388
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,279
two rounds on the y

389
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,279
so first uh for simplicity let us

390
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,320
consider

391
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,160
the case of a non-interactive strength

392
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,959
strong double i

393
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,759
so for non-inductive stronger boy the

394
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,920
formal statement that we prove is the

395
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,759
following

396
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,920
so assume the existence of c second

397
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,759
public encryption

398
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,720
then there exists an mp language l that

399
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,600
satisfies the following

400
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,160
if a strong of a non-interactive

401
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,720
argument for l is proved by using a

402
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,880
block obvious proper reduction based on

403
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
voltage assumption

404
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
then a such assumption must be false

405
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
so in other words we show that unless we

406
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,680
use force assumption we cannot obtain no

407
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
interest from the boy using prop

408
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
reduction under polished assumption

409
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,880
and now

410
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
to prove this statement we use a

411
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,199
well-known meta reduction technique

412
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,000
so require that our goal is to show that

413
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
if there exists a proper reduction for

414
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
non-extractive strong why then the

415
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
underlying assumption must be false

416
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,560
so

417
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,959
towards showing this we showed that the

418
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
any such proper reduction can be used to

419
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,920
efficiently break the assumption

420
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,440
which implies that the assumption is

421
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,160
imposed as desired

422
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
so let me explain this approach in a

423
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
little more detail

424
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
and first recall that the obvious proper

425
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,759
reduction for strong w i guarantee that

426
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,079
for any two distribution of a statement

427
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
weakness and for any verifier against

428
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,679
ronda bryce

429
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,559
if the verifier successfully breaks down

430
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,599
the boy

431
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
then either the reduction breaks under

432
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,240
an assumption or it's distinguished to

433
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,280
distribution of a statement

434
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,599
then

435
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,319
in the first step of through we design a

436
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,640
specific language distribution over

437
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,039
statement weakness and verify against

438
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
all the voice such that even though this

439
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,840
particular verify is successful breaks

440
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,280
on the boy

441
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
the reduction cannot distinguish

442
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,640
distinguish the distribution of a

443
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
statement when it is given access to

444
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
this particular verify

445
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
so once we show this it follows from the

446
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960
property of the proper reduction that

447
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
when the reduction is given access to

448
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,799
this particular periphery

449
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
it must break it must breaks under an

450
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,679
assumption since it cannot distinguish

451
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,039
the distribution statement

452
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,320
then in the second step of approve we

453
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
show that that reduction and the

454
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
verifiers that we have designed can

455
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
actually be executed in permeable

456
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
and this means that we can break the

457
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
underlying assumption in polynomial time

458
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
so we can conclude that the assumption

459
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,840
must be false as desired

460
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,240
so now let me explain each step in more

461
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
detail and let me start from the first

462
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
step

463
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,360
so require that in this step our goal is

464
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,919
to design a language distribution and

465
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,799
the verifier such that the verifiers can

466
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,880
successfully breaks on the y

467
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
but the reduction cannot distinguish the

468
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,760
distribution of a statement

469
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
so we consider the setting where the

470
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,240
deduction is giving a success as a

471
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
statement from the challenger

472
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,880
and it tried to guess

473
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
from which distribution the statement

474
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
sampled

475
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
and the reduction is given access to

476
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,240
access to a verified error as an oracle

477
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
and the first as a warm up

478
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
let us consider a simple case where

479
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,480
after receiving the statement from the

480
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,600
challenger

481
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
the relationship to the forward

482
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
for the statement to the verifier

483
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,600
along with some fruit that it created by

484
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
itself

485
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,600
now uh the first observation is that

486
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,160
without loss of generality we can assume

487
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
that the reduction of the verifier board

488
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
if the reduction center proves that it's

489
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,559
not accepting

490
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,720
and this is because a cheating periphery

491
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
against the bridge is supposed to

492
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,720
interact with the honest grouper which

493
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
always give up the screw

494
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,520
so a verifier against um the verify you

495
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
can break stronger boy even when it

496
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,039
about whenever you seem to prove that

497
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
it's not accepting

498
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,120
so

499
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,280
this observation implies that for the

500
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
reduction that the access to the verify

501
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
is useless unless it send the accent

502
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
proof to the verifier

503
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,679
now uh the key the key point is that if

504
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
the deduction can indeed generate access

505
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
to proof for the statement is that it

506
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
disables from challenger

507
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,679
then it can be used to break the

508
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
soundness

509
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,520
and this is because if we consider

510
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
language such that the true and false

511
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
statement are indistinguishable

512
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,480
then it follows that even when we give a

513
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,799
false statement to the reduction the

514
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,799
reduction still send exactly proof to

515
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,320
the verifier

516
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,559
and this clearly contradicts soundness

517
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
so uh in the in the simple case with the

518
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
reduction simply for the statement from

519
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
the challenger to the verifier we can

520
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,440
show that the access to the verifier is

521
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
useless

522
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
however

523
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,320
the deduction does not necessarily

524
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,240
always simply forward statement to the

525
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,520
verifier

526
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,080
and in general it can send any any

527
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,960
statement to the verifier and

528
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,039
this statement might be somehow

529
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,200
correlated with the statement that the

530
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
deduction receives from a challenge

531
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,120
and to handle this case we design

532
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,520
language and distribution that have some

533
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
kind of number ability

534
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,120
by using a cgsec encryption

535
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,120
so specifically we call the language l

536
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,360
that's that consists of a public

537
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
publicly ciphertext sphere over ccsek

538
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,039
pke

539
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,159
such that either 0 or 1 is encrypted in

540
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
the ciphertext

541
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,240
and also for each public tpk and the

542
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,840
binary value b

543
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,559
we consider distribution x bkb

544
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,120
that output land of encryption b under

545
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
the probability bpk

546
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,120
and i know that it is easy to see that

547
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
the the distribution x

548
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
x bkb is a distribution of true

549
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,439
statement of the language l

550
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
now

551
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
given these language and distributions

552
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,600
the question we consider is that for

553
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,880
random public dpk further the deduction

554
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
giving any success changing verifier

555
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
about c2 distribution

556
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
can these things can distinguish the

557
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,080
distribution xp 0 and xbox

558
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,760
and the answer to this question is no

559
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,720
and this is because we can design a

560
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,960
specific cheating verifier that breaks

561
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
down the y by using the decryption or a

562
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,399
computation second bk

563
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,600
so indeed for for the for this

564
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
particular language and distribution

565
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
that we have designed

566
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
a verify against on the board is

567
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
required to distinguish the proof

568
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
generate for engagement zero and the

569
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
proof generate for inclusion one and by

570
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
emulating the decryption oracle the

571
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
verifier can easily just

572
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
easily distinguish these two these cases

573
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,400
by just creating the statement to the

574
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
decreased variable

575
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,440
then since this means that the

576
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
making query to this particular change

577
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
verify is essentially equivalent to

578
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,159
making query to the decryption oracle

579
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
the security of ccpe directly guarantees

580
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
that the access to this particular

581
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,799
chasing verifier is useless to

582
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
distinguish the distribution x because

583
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,799
zero and expected one as desired

584
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,880
so now let's go to step two

585
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,280
and from step one we know that for

586
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,919
random public dpk we have a success

587
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,120
cheating verify about the distribution

588
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,279
dpk 0 and 2k1 such that the reduction

589
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,080
given the verifier must break the max

590
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
must break the assumption rather than

591
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,279
distinguish the distribution of a

592
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,600
statement

593
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,320
and now the key observation is that for

594
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,880
any public dpk the verifiers that we

595
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
have designed can be executed in

596
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
polynomial time by using a corresponding

597
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,960
secret key sk

598
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
and this is because the verifier that we

599
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
have designed just uses a decryption

600
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
rule

601
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,360
so

602
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,679
we can conclude that we can efficiently

603
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,360
break the assumption by using the

604
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,960
deduction and our verifier and so we can

605
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,880
conclude that the assumption must be

606
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,960
force are desired

607
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,360
and this is a proof for the case of no

608
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,559
interference on the y

609
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,640
now from now from now on i'll briefly

610
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
explain how we can extend our technique

611
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,279
from non-interactive strong devoid to to

612
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,039
round stone of white

613
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,000
and

614
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
let me first explain the case of the

615
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,840
standard non-trade repeat

616
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,320
setting so it turned out that the only

617
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
problem we have in this setting is that

618
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
in the case of two rounds from the void

619
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
the reduction might rewind the verifier

620
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
and in particular the reduction might

621
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
request a verifier to use the randomness

622
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159
for for different statement

623
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
so fortunately in the standard

624
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,760
non-deleted setting this problem can be

625
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,279
solved very easily

626
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,360
and the key point is that in the

627
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,760
settings the statement is degreed before

628
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
the first period message and so if

629
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
because they're verified the computed

630
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,279
randomness by prime pl on the statement

631
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,279
we can effectively prevent use of

632
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,799
randomness for different statements

633
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,440
so with this modification we can prove

634
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,760
the impossibility of to run stronger in

635
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,000
the standard setting just like no

636
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,880
indirectly stronger

637
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,240
next uh let us let me cons let's

638
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
consider the two round strong developer

639
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,360
in the deletive setting

640
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,159
so the problem is the same as before

641
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,400
namely the problem is that the reduction

642
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
might request verifier to use randomness

643
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,279
for different statements

644
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,159
and since in the delays in the deleted

645
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,000
settings the statement is chosen after

646
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,559
the verified message we cannot solve

647
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,240
this problem by using pof anymore

648
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,159
and in this setting we use a slightly

649
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,760
different approach from the guest of

650
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,720
anointer

651
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
no interactive wri strong but

652
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,640
non-interactive strong way and in

653
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,039
particular we showed that the strong wri

654
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,520
imply a weak form of external knowledge

655
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,840
and then we reuse our impossibility of

656
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,720
weak zero knowledge

657
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,520
so the detail of this approach is a bit

658
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,919
involved so i won't explain the detail

659
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,120
in this talk

660
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
so if you are interested the detail can

661
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,799
be found in the paper

662
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,240
finally let me give a conclusion

663
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,960
so in this work we give

664
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
black boxing prosperity about obtaining

665
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
two round weak cell knowledge and stolen

666
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
the void from pulmonary heart assumption

667
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
so i'll take our message is that you

668
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,400
know that obtained to run with the

669
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
knowledge and strong deploy from polymer

670
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,360
hardness

671
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
you have to use number techniques at

672
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,679
least either for soundness or proof of

673
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,159
privacy

674
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,200
so this concludes my talk

675
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,679
thank you for listening
