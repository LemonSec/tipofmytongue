00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,939
[Applause]

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,800
hello i am so excited to be back at

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,040
offensive con for the third time you

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,360
know first i had spoken to you before

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,400
about hacking embedded devices then i

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,560
talked to you all about an android bug

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,519
allegedly used by nso and this year i

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
get to come and chat to you about the

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
many many zero days we saw in the wild

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320
in 2021

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
so first off if you don't know me my

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,160
name is matty stone i am a researcher on

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
project zero where i focus on zero days

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,520
in the wild so learning from them seeing

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
how do we use that information for

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,000
making zero day hard project zero's

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
mission so let's get into it

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
so as i said project zero mission make

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,680
zero day hard it kills me that it's

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,079
without the hyphen but i gotta respect

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
the mission i guess and so that's where

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,719
all of this work that for that i'm doing

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,239
comes from of making sure that any you

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
know project zeros research and

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,640
vulnerability research is founded in

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,040
what is actually happening it's not so

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,799
much what are we actually or what do we

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
think is happening but what are

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,640
attackers using what do those zero days

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
look like and so that's where all of

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
this work sort of comes from in the lens

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
that i have on it

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
so i say a lot in the wild zero day zero

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,119
days exploit in the wild actively

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,119
exploited things like that

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,960
but unfortunately

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,040
i don't actually know all of the zero

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
days that are actively exploited in the

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,439
wild you know it turns out folks don't

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,200
just say like hey planning to use this

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
tomorrow just want to give it to you to

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
give a heads up

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,840
so instead while this is the language we

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,119
use

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
to be more technically correct it's

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
actually the zero-day exploits that were

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
detected and publicly disclosed as in

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,880
the wild

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,159
and that

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,880
distinction i think is important because

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,600
it means that all of the conclusions all

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,759
of the data we have we have to remember

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,159
that there is going to be those biases

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,520
those gaps and even more so because we

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,318
don't have all of the ground

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,800
ground truth data it means that we don't

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
always know

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
what exactly those biases may be and

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
those conclusions are

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,040
so

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
that's all of my you know sort of

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
caveats and we'll get into more caveats

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
later but just wanted that distinction

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,599
there

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
so let's get into the fun stuff there

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
were 57 zero days last year detected and

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,440
disclosed as in the wild which means i

68
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,519
got to keep my job because there was a

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,680
lot to analyze

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
and so through this talk i was going to

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,519
chat with you all about what i think

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
i've learned from it what i saw as

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,319
trends looking back over many years etc

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
etc

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
but again this was my conclusion to

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
looking at the data and i think other

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
people would have them so in case you

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
want to go back and verify you want to

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
see what we're working off of we do keep

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,680
a public

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,159
spreadsheet where we track all of these

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
in the wild zero days so feel free to

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,599
check it out it goes back to mid 2014.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
so as i said a caveat these are my takes

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,760
and thoughts and i'd love to hear yours

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
when i was trying to come up with this

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,360
talk it's the third year that i'm trying

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
to do a year in review

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,080
and

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
it was actually a lot of data

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
i was looking at it and i was like

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,159
nothing is standing out as it had for

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
the year in review in 2019 and the year

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,040
in the review of 2020. nothing seems all

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,480
that exciting nothing seems wow we've

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
never seen this before

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
and finally i realized

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,080
that might be a conclusion in and of

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
itself despite having all of these data

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,480
points so i know usually you wait

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
till the end of the talk to give your

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
conclusion after you've presented all

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
these data presented all your examples

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,159
but i'm actually going to start by

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,239
telling you what i think my conclusions

106
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,159
are based on analyzing all these zero

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,040
days

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,519
so then you can see going into all of

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,599
the examples we're going to talk about

110
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,640
see okay do i agree do i disagree with

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
what these conclusions are and then i

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,400
would love for to hear from y'all after

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
the con see what you think

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
from there so let's get started the

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
first one is

116
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,918
as you will see 57-0 days is

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
an astronomical amount compared to

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
previous years

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
and so there were a lot of headlines

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
this year of everyone is being hacked

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
way more security is the worst never use

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,600
any products there's don't use iphone

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
don't use android you know basically go

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,280
offline

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
i don't think this uptick actually is an

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
indicator that security is getting worse

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,560
people are more vulnerable etc

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,520
to me this uptick actually represents

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
positive indicators of security

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
so that's my first point

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
the second point which i actually

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
accidentally gave you all sneak peek to

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
a few slides ago is

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
and we have so many more data points of

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
what is actually happening in the wild

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
and from those data points what we

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,759
actually found is

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,440
it's nothing too special

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
it was things that we've seen before it

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
was bug patterns that we've seen over

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
the last couple years components

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
targeted matched what you know public

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
research was matching exploit

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
methodologies weren't really all that

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
new

146
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
there is one exception to this which

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,080
we'll get to but in general

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,400
56 out of 57 seemed pretty

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
and lastly

150
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
we have way more data than ever before

151
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,039
to look at this stuff

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,680
and from that what i found is

153
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
even more confidence that we're missing

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,240
more than i thought we were every year i

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,639
seem to think we are actually catching a

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,520
smaller and smaller percentage of zero

157
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
days that are actually actually in use

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,039
and i do think there are

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
real tactical

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
not tactical but practical things that

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
can be done to address some of these

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,600
gaps

163
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
so first

164
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,280
why do i think the fact that there's a

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
way more in the wild zero days is

166
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
actually progress

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
well

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
this graph probably doesn't help my

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,960
point all that much so as i said before

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
project zero has been tracking these

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,319
since mid-2014 when the team was founded

172
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,600
so i decided to start the graph at the

173
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
first full year which was 2015. 2015 was

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
previously the max number that we'd ever

175
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160
seen before at 26

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,440
uh no 28 sorry

177
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,720
and this year we hit 57 more than double

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
the previous max

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,880
and this graph looks even scarier and

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
somewhat more stark when you look at it

181
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
compared to 2020 2020 was only at 25 and

182
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
yet something happened january 2021 that

183
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,360
suddenly causes the next 12 months to

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
have this much more

185
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
so actually in my 2019 year in review of

186
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,440
zero days used in the wild my whole

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
thesis i guess was

188
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
um we have a detection deficit when it

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
comes to these i said that as a

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
community our ability to detect zero

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
days being used in the wild is severely

192
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
lacking to the point that we can't

193
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,880
draw significant conclusions due to the

194
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
lack and biases and the data we have

195
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,400
collected

196
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
so i think we've made a lot of progress

197
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
since then the fact that that's gone up

198
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,160
and i think there's actual real causes

199
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
that we can attribute to that jump more

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
than

201
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
everyone is using zero days for

202
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
i think there's much more

203
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,960
um quantifiable reasons explanatory

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,599
reasons of what changed december 2020 to

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,240
january 2021

206
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
so the big two pieces of it i think are

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
there's more detection and more

208
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
disclosure

209
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
because remember as i said at the

210
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,479
beginning what we're measuring is not

211
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
actually the number of exploits used in

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
the wild it's the number of exploits

213
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,840
detected and disclosed as in the wild

214
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
and so to me it makes a lot more sense

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
if we have reason to believe that

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,879
there's been more detection there's been

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
more disclosure why wouldn't that

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,240
explain this jump

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
so let's talk about the first one

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
more detection

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
so

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
this whole area of

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
research

224
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,520
kind of makes me uncomfortable i like

225
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
quantifiable data i like exact answers i

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,479
don't really like feelings

227
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
but unfortunately we got to deal with a

228
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,200
lot of feelings and anecdotes here and

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
anecdotally i have heard a lot of

230
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
stories of folks getting more into

231
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
putting resources into zero day

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,399
detection

233
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,080
and thankfully there's at least one

234
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
metric that may help explain this

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
and so

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
these are the number of different

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,640
reporters for in the wild zero days over

238
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,360
the last few years so these i removed

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
any that had been reported anonymously

240
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
but if they had an in the wild

241
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
annotation or comment and that person

242
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
was listed as credited for the cve i put

243
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,839
them here and what we see is there is

244
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
double the number of folks

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,519
listed as previous years so maybe you

246
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,920
know it's all a coincidence but i do

247
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
think it shows that there's a lot more

248
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
folks looking at this maybe or

249
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
if it's the same number folks there's a

250
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,279
lot more folks

251
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
disclosing owning it talking about the

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
fact that they found it so to me that

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
helps show yeah that's probably why this

254
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,240
number has gone up

255
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
the second side is more disclosure

256
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,120
so

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,000
in

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,839
november 2020

259
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
apple began annotating their release

260
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
notes with an in the wild annotation for

261
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,160
the first time before

262
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,519
november of 2020 they never put any of

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,519
those notes that hey we've heard this

264
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,519
may have been exploited in the wild or

265
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,320
whatever we relied on researchers to

266
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,360
come forward and publish about it

267
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
android had never done that before

268
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
january

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
2021 so we have these two large products

270
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,440
and vendors

271
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
finally for the first time coming out

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
and saying we're not going to rely on

273
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,920
researchers to come and tell folks in

274
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
the public that there's in the wild

275
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,079
exploitation we will tell you if we've

276
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,360
been

277
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
informed that

278
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,560
and so if we look at the number of apple

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
you know webkit ios and mac os and

280
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,640
android

281
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,680
uh

282
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
zero day in the wild over you know this

283
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,279
period of time

284
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,320
it's jumped hugely if that's a word

285
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
in this year

286
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
and

287
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
it's actually more interesting when we

288
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,399
take a look at

289
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,160
which of those bugs were reported

290
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,519
anonymously in not

291
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,320
non-anonymously

292
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
and the reason why i think this matters

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
in the context of annotations now on

294
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
release notes

295
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
is that if you do not want credit for

296
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,399
the cve on a security bulletin

297
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,079
i think it's pretty unlikely you're

298
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,839
gonna publish a blog post and be like

299
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,680
hey i have evidence i have reason to

300
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,880
believe i've seen this this was

301
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
exploited in the wild

302
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
and so

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
if y'all stand with me on the assumption

304
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,839
that means that we would have known

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,560
about 12 less zero days this year

306
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,600
and so kudos to apple and android google

307
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
chrome microsoft firefox adobe um

308
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
etc have been doing this so they get

309
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
kudos for you know doing it more years

310
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
many years before as well but i think

311
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
this is a great step from android and

312
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,519
apple and contributes to the more

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,079
disclosure

314
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,720
so my next claim is

315
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
nothing's all that new it's kind of met

316
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,480
and

317
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
so the first thing is is like

318
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
yeah it's still all memory corruption

319
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
well not all but mostly and that is how

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
just about all of these bugs work there

321
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,760
were 39 of the 57

322
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,800
um zero days were memory corruption bugs

323
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
which accounted for 68

324
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,399
um

325
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,680
which is still you know the vast

326
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,800
majority

327
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
of all of these bugs and then when you

328
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
break it down even further

329
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
they're really falling into

330
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
these bug patterns

331
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
all of us know about have seen over and

332
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,839
over again you know

333
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,160
use after free is still for like the

334
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
past four years it's been the number one

335
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,720
um most common vulnerability of zero

336
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
days in the wild and then

337
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
out of bounds reads or rights buffer

338
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
overflows energy overflows so these are

339
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,959
all bug patterns that we've seen a dime

340
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,160
a dozen time

341
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
and that's what is making up so many of

342
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,440
these in the wild zero days

343
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
so next i'm going to support my claim

344
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,839
that everything is sort of

345
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,880
meh

346
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,079
we're going to go through each of the

347
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
different browsers or not browsers each

348
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,839
of the different sort of platforms the

349
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
main ones obviously

350
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,360
well much to my sugar and i'm not

351
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
allowed to come and just talk to you

352
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
about every single bug that we've seen

353
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
this year i guess y'all would not want

354
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
to sit here for eight hours and listen

355
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
to that um so we're going to go through

356
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
each of sort of the big platforms talk

357
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
about some of the examples talk about

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
why

359
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
there really wasn't much that's new

360
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,519
so first in terms of browsers we saw 14

361
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,240
for chromium seven for webkit safari and

362
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
four for internet explorer

363
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
um

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
and

365
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,880
for those if we break down the

366
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
components of the browser they're

367
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
targeting we still see that the vast

368
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
majority is javascript engines which

369
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
makes sense you know especially

370
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
listening to um

371
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
listening to you know samuel and amy's

372
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,000
talks yesterday there is still a lot of

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
exploitation you can do it's generally

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
there are a lot of bug patterns we can

375
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,320
still follow and then with the second

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
most common component being targeted

377
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
being the dom engine

378
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,240
and so

379
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
this basically matches the last

380
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,000
um

381
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
three years as well for all of the last

382
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,920
three years javascript engine has been

383
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,079
the around 45 to 50 percent

384
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,240
of the browser bugs and dom engine has

385
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
been around 14 to 17 percent so it's

386
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
staying pretty stable

387
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
maybe not all of y'all's goal is to make

388
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
zero day hard but it is my goal and so

389
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
one of the ways that i will feel like

390
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
yeah we've made a big step

391
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
it is harder is when these graphs of

392
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,120
components being targeted how attackers

393
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
are able to have success with zero days

394
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
when that changes

395
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,320
so chrome um

396
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
it's just sort of yeah it followed a lot

397
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
of the common

398
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
targets that we've seen pretty

399
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
across the board the same

400
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
yeah

401
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,199
webkit was similar for javascript core

402
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
one indexeddb one storage and one

403
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,800
universal cross-site scripting

404
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
but i'm gonna sort of make it tangent

405
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,560
and bring all in on a story time here

406
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,279
so

407
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,920
this is a use after free and webkit it

408
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
was patched in

409
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
september

410
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,320
of last year and so this is the

411
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
description you know it says

412
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
may have been actively exploited and

413
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
used after free so not a lot of

414
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,800
information in there and i was like i

415
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,320
haven't really ever done browser stuff

416
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
i've definitely never done webkit i want

417
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,839
a root cause analysis and variant

418
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
analysis seems like a great bug to just

419
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
get started and get into that

420
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
so unfortunately

421
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
despite being open source webkit does

422
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,519
not tie

423
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
cves or their security bulletins to the

424
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
patch

425
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,959
and so

426
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,199
i thought okay to figure out what patch

427
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
it may be i need to go through between

428
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,320
the two releases and i'll see what bugs

429
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,079
have changed which ones look security

430
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,519
and things like that

431
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
and after combing through i found this

432
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,399
bug definitely security there weren't

433
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
really many other options there

434
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
talked to the teammates we all felt

435
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
pretty confident this was the bug and so

436
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,519
i got to work you know actually i was

437
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,279
pretty proud of myself i got that done

438
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,560
pretty quickly and wrote up the rca

439
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,199
waited till 30 days patch to publish it

440
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,720
because that's

441
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
our project zero

442
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,199
policy from this last year and

443
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,560
um

444
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,199
everything was bliss right

445
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
seven days later

446
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
that appears in my inbox greetings from

447
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,240
apple product security i really tried

448
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
not to open it but

449
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
unfortunately that didn't seem like a

450
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,759
long-term plan so i did and very kindly

451
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
apple product security let me know that

452
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,120
i had in fact

453
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,360
root caused the wrong bug and published

454
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,279
the pock for a bug that was not actually

455
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,910
fixed yet

456
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,639
[Music]

457
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,399
yes

458
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,120
not my favorite day i gotta say that

459
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,519
but i do appreciate apple one letting me

460
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
know into how kindly

461
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
they handled that

462
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
um and so especially even more kindly

463
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
they sent me the correct patch uh the

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,240
one that actually was the bug i was

465
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,720
trying to root cause so hey i just got

466
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
double the webkit experience i thought i

467
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,079
was done

468
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,880
i checked the box but no and scarily

469
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,599
enough it was an indexeddb which i very

470
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
quickly learned was not probably the

471
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,919
component i would jump in for first time

472
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,319
browser but here we were i felt

473
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
published the first wrong one you know

474
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
updated our public github of rcas to say

475
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,760
whoopsydaisy on it and so i needed to

476
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
get a correct one out there

477
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,320
so there were two different files

478
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,919
changed in this patch

479
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,640
one was idb request

480
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
and the other was this

481
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,120
file called crossthreadtask.h

482
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
which is used in indexeddb as you would

483
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,200
imagine for cross thread tasks to occur

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
if you know one thread needs to say hey

485
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
i need you to do this database thing for

486
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
me

487
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
and

488
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
this was

489
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
i didn't really know what to make of

490
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,160
this as someone who has little c plus

491
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,799
plus even littler browser and even less

492
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,200
webkit experience i was like huh what is

493
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
what am i doing with that

494
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,919
um

495
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
but what it turns out that was fixing is

496
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
that the object that was being freed and

497
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
this used after free and the object that

498
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
was the colleague that create crossfit

499
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
task is this thing called an idb open db

500
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,200
request

501
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,400
which extends idb request

502
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,679
and

503
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,960
notably idb request then extends this

504
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
thread safe ref counted

505
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
ide request class

506
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,799
and so if we look back

507
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,080
at the

508
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
patch there at the top basically there

509
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,200
are two different types

510
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,679
a function for create cross thread task

511
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,640
one

512
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,120
the top one is enabled as a template if

513
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
whatever collie's type

514
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
is

515
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
thread safe ref counted collie type is a

516
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
base of it

517
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
and that uses the make ref pointer

518
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,520
for the collie

519
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
but the bottom one that's saying

520
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,400
if the collie's type is not a child of

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,559
threat safe ref counted

522
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
ankle bracket

523
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
kali type then that one's going to use a

524
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,559
raw pointer

525
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
and despite what it looked like

526
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,400
um idb opened the request should use the

527
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
top it actually is the bottom one which

528
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
had the raw pointer leading to the use

529
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,520
after free

530
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,360
and the reason why is that idb open db

531
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,559
request

532
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,120
actually extends thread safe ref counted

533
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,039
idb request not idb open db request and

534
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,200
so that's why it ended up going into

535
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
the

536
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,240
whatchamacallit the raw pointer option

537
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,919
and

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,480
so i have a heart next to this because

539
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,840
it's a tweetable puck and yvonne and i

540
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,080
this year got very excited each time one

541
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
of the in the wild zero days had a pock

542
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
that was less than 280 characters and we

543
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
could tweet so if you see hearts

544
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
that is that is why

545
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,559
tweetable talk

546
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,440
um and so this is how you trigger it

547
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
when i was asking my teammates preparing

548
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
for this presentation what was your

549
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,640
favorite bug of the year um there was a

550
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
clear favorite in general but this one

551
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
also got a

552
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,880
head nod because um in sergei's words

553
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,640
if i let's see if i get his words

554
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,000
correctly it's dealing with the uh oh i

555
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
wrote it a bug in template meta

556
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,600
programming so it's at least somewhat

557
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,799
modern

558
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
so there we go

559
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
but still they use after free so there's

560
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,000
my story time

561
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,120
next internet explorer

562
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,799
and maybe you're wondering why am i

563
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,840
giving

564
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,760
potentially more slides to internet

565
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
explorer than chromium

566
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,159
because i think this graph is super

567
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,280
interesting

568
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,240
since 2015 over the last seven years the

569
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
number of internet explorers there it is

570
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,200
really really isn't changing all that

571
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,159
much despite the changes in market share

572
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,919
and it turns out though that we can sort

573
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,320
of see why in the data

574
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,159
if we look at the different components

575
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,960
targeted over the last few years this

576
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,000
year 75 percent of them suddenly were in

577
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
ms html which is the internet explorer

578
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
trident browser engine

579
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,799
and oops jumping ahead

580
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,799
and what's interesting is all three of

581
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,039
those were not actually delivered via

582
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,360
the browser to users so they came

583
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
through other files which could

584
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,240
automatically access internet explorer

585
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
on windows machines since mshtml is

586
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
there and thus it's not targeting folks

587
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
using internet explorer as their browser

588
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
different than

589
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,559
our other browser exploits and platforms

590
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,000
and so let's talk about one of these

591
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,760
examples cve

592
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,200
2021-33742 it's an out of bounds right

593
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,440
in ms html and so basically the context

594
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
google tag wrote a long blog post on

595
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,559
this

596
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,280
which i'll have linked in the slides

597
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,039
but basically malicious

598
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,799
office stocks were delivered to the

599
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,840
targets

600
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
and

601
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
the office docs loaded web content and

602
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,120
internet explorer it's spawned the ie

603
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,240
process via vba macros

604
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,559
and once you know it was fingerprinted

605
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
just decided to deliver the exploit it

606
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
was a pretty conventional bug it's an

607
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,760
out of bounds right in mshtml so

608
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
basically the length

609
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,480
of the inner html element is stored in

610
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,720
two different places in one place that

611
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
length was truncated and the other it

612
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
was not the truncated length was used

613
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
for the allocation the mem copy used the

614
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
non-truncated length so you know

615
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
generally this bug pattern that you sort

616
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
of see in intro to security classes and

617
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,200
cs nowadays too

618
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
but we got a tweetable puck out of it so

619
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
yay

620
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,679
um

621
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,880
so

622
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
it's we've been talking about a lot but

623
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
maybe these ie bugs will finally be done

624
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
i will not have to root cause another

625
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
internet explorer but unfortunately it

626
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,919
looks like that might not be the case

627
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,799
microsoft has announced that they will

628
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,159
be deprecating ie in 2022 in june so

629
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,720
that you'd think they'd be yay

630
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
but unfortunately the announcement also

631
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,240
said that the retirement does not affect

632
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,679
ms html trident engine and and thus that

633
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,360
will continue being accessible on

634
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,919
windows 10 builds and so

635
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,440
based on that i think it's probably

636
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
likely we will continue to see these ms

637
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,360
html bugs as a attack vector to get onto

638
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
machines

639
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
as a side note which

640
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
when we're thinking about enterprise

641
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,480
sort of targeting as well

642
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
enterprises will be allowed

643
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
it says in here to pay for support

644
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
through 2029. so

645
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
internet explorer might we might still

646
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,840
be talking about it in 2028

647
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
windows

648
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
so

649
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,240
lots of exploits

650
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,600
tend to be exact

651
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
and while none of this made us super

652
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
super excited i do think this deserves a

653
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
call out because this is one of the

654
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
places i think we can look and be like

655
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,799
okay maybe zero day on windows is

656
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
getting a little bit harder because we

657
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,559
only had two of the 10 as win 32k this

658
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,000
year and in 2019 there were 75 percent

659
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,039
of windows zero days um targeting window

660
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,400
32k so you know with the

661
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,919
one windows 7 being deprecated into the

662
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,799
windows 10 progressive lockdowns um i

663
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,159
think that might account for why we're

664
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,159
seeing this um

665
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,600
this movement towards different

666
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,720
components being targeted

667
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,840
next one ios and mac os

668
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,640
so

669
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,720
we finally got our first mac os in the

670
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,919
wild

671
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,840
you know everyone's saying matt use max

672
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,679
they're never targeted it's cool we have

673
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
the evidence now

674
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,320
so what did those look like so i'm sort

675
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
of grouping them together since

676
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
um they're similar components

677
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
four ios one mac os

678
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
um and of those five two targeted i o

679
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,960
mobile frame buffer two targeted the xmu

680
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,480
kernel and one targeted core graphs

681
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
so first up io mobile frame buffer it's

682
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,240
really had its time to shine lately but

683
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,320
unfortunately it's really not all that

684
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,159
new

685
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,559
so we've seen a lot of i o mobile frame

686
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,480
buffer research

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,559
publicly and the years leading up to

688
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,600
this so it's not shocking it's not this

689
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
new component of how to get into the

690
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,760
iphones

691
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,840
and when we also take a look at the two

692
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,120
x and u bugs oh yes side note one of the

693
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
zero days for 2022 so far is also iot

694
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,480
mobile frame buffer so seems like it may

695
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
continue

696
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,799
but yeah so for the two x and use the

697
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,720
ios one was using mock vouchers

698
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
and the

699
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
mac os one was using mock messages so

700
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,200
both of those are objects in

701
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,360
xnu's ipc mechanisms and we've actually

702
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,559
seen

703
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,559
in the wilds targeting both of those

704
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,640
components previously despite the

705
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,520
smaller number of sample size

706
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,799
so we still

707
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,080
yeah oops wrong way

708
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,400
and but as a pause

709
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,880
there was one bug that has led to the

710
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
exception so i need a drum roll come on

711
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,279
you don't just

712
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,760
for the best bug of the year

713
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,159
my doggie

714
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,640
my dog's name is bug and i did not name

715
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
him and mark dowd showed us a picture of

716
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
his cat so i had to fit him in there

717
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
somewhere

718
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
hi bug

719
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,679
but for real so

720
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,799
forced entry the zero click imessage bug

721
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,240
is really the one exploits that

722
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,320
i think everyone just stopped and was

723
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,840
like whoa this is impressive so ian beer

724
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
at the end of last year published

725
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,120
very detailed blog posts into sort of

726
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,240
the history of the components the bug

727
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,559
and most notably the exploit because

728
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,840
actually the bug really isn't

729
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,919
super interesting part i just had to

730
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,600
save bug so i could give you all a photo

731
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,840
of my dog but it's the exploit where it

732
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,480
really sets it apart and so i'll link to

733
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,320
ian's blog post because i will not do it

734
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
justice of all the detail he provides

735
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,679
but basically it is an integer overflow

736
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,919
in the core graphics

737
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,000
api and specifically the jbig2

738
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
image parser and so the other thing that

739
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
was notable about this though is you

740
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,600
know for years

741
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,679
everyone's been saying zero click i

742
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,919
message bugs zero click imessage bugs

743
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,360
zero click imessage bugs and we've known

744
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
that they're apparently in use but no

745
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
one's found any examples of it we had

746
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
natalie and samuel you know at the last

747
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,440
offensive con giving a security

748
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
researcher talk on it but still we

749
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
didn't have examples so we finally have

750
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,600
that example here and so what's

751
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,640
happening is we have the 32-bit integer

752
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
num sims and we have this loop that is

753
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,600
adding to it if you construct

754
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,440
the number of segments or

755
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,760
correctly you can cause num sims to

756
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,360
overflow

757
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,799
with the

758
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,399
in that overflowed

759
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,480
number is used in the malik at number

760
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,679
three but when you're copying it is not

761
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,600
it is doing each one which can lead you

762
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,678
to having that integer overflow

763
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,919
so the bug wasn't that cool but the

764
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,919
exploit was and i'm not going to even

765
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,760
pretend to be able to explain it all to

766
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
you in this talk so just know if you

767
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
have not somehow not read this blog post

768
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,440
yet

769
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
hopefully my other compression format is

770
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,799
turned complete

771
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,559
will help get you there

772
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,760
and so check that out

773
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,360
so the last sort of vendor section we're

774
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
going to talk about is android

775
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,440
we finally have some android in the wild

776
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,840
zero days to reference to talk about yes

777
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
it is being exploited yes it is being

778
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
targeted so prior to this year we only

779
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,120
had one example of an android in the

780
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
wild and that was what i talked to you

781
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,880
all about here at offensive con 2020

782
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,679
and so this year we actually had seven

783
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,399
so

784
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
these seven zero days um

785
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,919
targeted

786
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,520
qualcomm adreno gpu our mali gpu and two

787
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
targeted the upstream kernel

788
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
and so this was really great data to

789
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,480
have

790
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
over 20 2020 and 2021 we've been seeing

791
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,240
more and more

792
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
security researchers publish example

793
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
um android chains and all of them were

794
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
public targeting the gpu drivers and so

795
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,159
this sort of shows like

796
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
yeah it is a really good target and the

797
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
gap between the

798
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,720
real

799
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,880
actually happening zero days and what

800
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,279
security researchers were doing was

801
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,919
pretty close and the reason why

802
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,640
these gpu drivers is of such interest

803
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
makes a lot of sense android ecosystem

804
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,679
is becoming so and so fragmented that if

805
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,080
you want to maintain a capability for

806
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
android devices then that can require

807
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
lots and lots of exploits

808
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
but if you then take a step back and

809
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,159
think about how oh

810
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,159
there's really only two gpu providers

811
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,880
for the whole android ecosystem suddenly

812
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
you only really need two exploits one

813
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,120
for the qualcomm adreno and one for our

814
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,279
mali to be able to have so much more

815
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,600
coverage across the android ecosystem

816
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,159
then with the two upstream kernel bucks

817
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:44,880
so

818
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,120
the trend we saw here unfortunately

819
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
continued

820
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
compared to the one that we had seen in

821
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,679
2019 in that these two upstream kernel

822
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,799
bugs were both previously known upstream

823
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,679
prior to their exploitation in android

824
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,600
and so the android kernel had just not

825
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,480
taken

826
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
um those patches

827
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,039
so here's an example basically the story

828
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,799
goes is that

829
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,279
there was a bug fists applied to the

830
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
android kernel a few weeks before this

831
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
one it actually

832
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,880
introduced this bug

833
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,720
so this bug was quickly patched i think

834
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,559
about two weeks later

835
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,039
in september

836
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,039
that first patch that was fixing the

837
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,760
original one and introducing a bug that

838
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,320
was included in the android december

839
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,679
2020

840
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,440
security bulletin

841
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
but the fix for the bug it introduced

842
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,039
was not included in the security

843
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,279
bulletin so while the linux upstream

844
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,760
kernel was only vulnerable to this for

845
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
about two to three weeks

846
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,919
it was not patched in android until

847
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,480
november 2021 giving about 11 months

848
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,799
of vulnerability in android

849
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,519
and so this sort of continues because

850
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
the binder bug from 2019

851
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,880
also

852
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
was known or fixed in the upstream

853
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,720
kernel and had not

854
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
made it to android kernels

855
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,279
and this is similar to

856
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,760
something we saw

857
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,240
in that this bug did correctly label

858
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
upstream hey we're actually free um

859
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
fixing this previous commit

860
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,960
and

861
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,799
um

862
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,399
and but they still did not take the

863
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,159
second one they only included the

864
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,480
original commit

865
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,960
so that's sort of all of my reasoning at

866
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
the vendor level of

867
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
why i think this year was

868
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,000
kind of meh we didn't really see a lot

869
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,320
of new things the state of zero day

870
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,640
exploitation did not seem to really

871
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,039
change all that much from what we can

872
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,720
tell

873
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
but my last conclusion is though

874
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,279
yeah we have all this data

875
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,559
but i don't know

876
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,279
how much value to place in it

877
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,200
it makes me feel like oh we're missing

878
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,320
more and more and more as i studied more

879
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
and more and more zero days

880
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,519
so i'm going to talk to you about some

881
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,440
of the questions i have

882
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,840
as i was looking all of this

883
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,440
so first

884
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,240
where are the messaging app exploits we

885
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,320
know they exist yes it's harder to

886
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,159
detect because they are generally more

887
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,440
targeted than say the browser exploits

888
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
but that's a giant gap we have so far in

889
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,240
all of our record keeping we now have

890
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,799
two we have the whatsapp one from 2019

891
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,320
and we have the imessage one from this

892
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
year but we know messaging apps are an

893
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,480
interesting target yet they're not

894
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,720
um seen in the wild

895
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
what about the other phone components so

896
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
now we've seen a gpu driver being

897
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
targeted we see kernels but what about

898
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
wi-fi chips what about the basement

899
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,960
chips things like that yes some of the

900
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
again those are more difficult to likely

901
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,559
detect especially for physical proximity

902
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,159
but we know there's interest in them we

903
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
know they're being developed

904
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,919
so where's the detection linux

905
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,080
also is one you know we talk about

906
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,600
windows mac os

907
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,799
etc but we're not seeing the linux ones

908
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,240
all of cloud

909
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
while i tended to focus on sort of user

910
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,559
and devices in this presentation because

911
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,879
i had to choose something and cut

912
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,879
somewhere like that is a target of

913
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,679
interest so how do we begin to detect

914
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,679
those exploits

915
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,119
and lastly

916
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,520
where are the specific android oem i'd

917
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
mentioned that the ecosystem for android

918
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,320
has become so fragmented but that means

919
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,960
that it there should be we should be

920
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,239
seeing i would think samsung zero days

921
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,480
xiaomi zeros days wall wet pixel etc yet

922
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
we are only seeing those zero days that

923
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,199
you know arm qualcomm which or general

924
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,520
or the linux kernel

925
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,000
and so that question then leads me to

926
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,520
ask is it detection disclosure or both

927
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,399
are we

928
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,760
not detecting not putting in the

929
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,839
resources or having come up with a new

930
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,320
research area of how do you detect these

931
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
or are these being detected and folks

932
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,920
aren't sharing they have not you know

933
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,320
decided to start annotating their

934
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
release notes or publishing about it or

935
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
talking at all about that they've heard

936
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,320
from whoever reported that things are in

937
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,280
the wild

938
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,640
and i do think the

939
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,759
answer is likely both

940
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,200
i also

941
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,599
look at the reporters

942
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,520
and wonder why don't we see more vendor

943
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,920
security teams listed here

944
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,760
because if you think about it when we if

945
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,599
we want to get better at detection i do

946
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,160
i know maybe not everyone does but i do

947
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,680
if we want to get better at detecting

948
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,440
zero days wouldn't the vendors be the

949
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,040
best ones at it

950
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,560
because they have the most telemetry

951
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,000
right they actually have source code

952
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,079
they i would think have some debuggers

953
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,000
or testing infrastructure

954
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,079
but the ones highlighted here are the

955
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,359
only entities that have been credited

956
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,240
for

957
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
um in the wild cves for their own

958
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,640
product and that again i ask

959
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
and i don't know the answer to is it

960
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,240
that vendors are not putting in all the

961
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
resources and doing this work or not

962
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,720
having success or do they not disclose

963
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,119
it when it is a internal find or give it

964
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
a cbe or something like that

965
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,320
my second to last question is do all of

966
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,880
these bug patterns seem meh

967
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,760
seem

968
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,520
not that interesting seem like things

969
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,599
we've seen before because that's what we

970
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,839
know how to detect because we are

971
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,240
actually really anchoring on the bugs

972
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,920
we've seen before and what we know

973
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
vulnerabilities to look like

974
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,240
or is that actually representative of

975
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,599
what is happening of the general

976
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,760
population of zero days in use

977
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,240
my final question is where are the

978
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,359
sploits

979
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,160
so if you notice most of my just about

980
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,240
all of my presentation today is focused

981
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,960
on

982
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,040
bugs when i've gotten into the example

983
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,119
the details of the vulnerability

984
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,599
but when doing this work in publishing

985
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,280
my goal is first

986
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
we need an understanding of what is the

987
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,839
zero day being exploited and how is it

988
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,920
being exploited with both of those

989
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,960
pieces being really important um

990
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,119
and to understanding from the offensive

991
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,800
security researcher

992
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,320
point of view or security research or

993
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,760
point of view

994
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,599
however

995
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
out of the 57 zero days in the wild

996
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
there were only five of those exploit

997
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
samples publicly available

998
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,359
so there were some other instances still

999
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,599
in the single digits where folks

1000
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,720
published a detailed explanation and

1001
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,040
description of the exploit method like

1002
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
for example ian's blog post but the

1003
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,040
sample wasn't being shared

1004
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
but that's still such a small number of

1005
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,720
understanding of the exploit methods

1006
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,440
that's happening that we can't really

1007
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,960
take a look

1008
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,720
and make changes on implement

1009
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,680
mitigations understand

1010
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,920
if things actually are changing and

1011
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,359
getting

1012
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,160
the exploits look much different

1013
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,280
so

1014
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
that basically

1015
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,839
concludes most of what i was planning

1016
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,040
to cover i have

1017
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,320
i figured i would give you all my

1018
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,200
conclusions and emojis

1019
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,400
so first

1020
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,359
the big uptick of in the wild zero days

1021
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,880
i think is great

1022
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,800
one i have um

1023
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
plenty of work to do

1024
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,520
two i do think it is actually indicators

1025
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
of

1026
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,119
progress in this space both general

1027
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,839
security and in this in the wild

1028
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,000
detection and disclosure because as i

1029
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
explained to you before i do think most

1030
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,520
of this can be explained by detection

1031
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
and disclosure but i also think it's

1032
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
important to remember that

1033
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,440
when zero days are being used it's

1034
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
generally because less sophisticated

1035
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,359
technical means don't work

1036
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,839
so if we see a drop in zero days and

1037
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,440
they're like oh there's no zero days but

1038
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,000
hey everyone can be pwned by end days i

1039
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,760
don't think that's progress so that's

1040
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,839
why i also sort of

1041
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,160
advocate that especially for security

1042
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,119
teams don't anchor on trying to reduce

1043
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,960
the number of in the wild zero days

1044
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
second

1045
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,079
bug patterns and types are pretty

1046
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,720
similar to previous years

1047
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,800
yeah it was just sort of fine i'm glad

1048
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,839
we found them but

1049
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,400
i'm also glad that it seems security

1050
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
public security research and what's

1051
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,520
happening in the wilds do seem to be

1052
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,839
closely related when you know new

1053
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,680
decisions are being based on based on

1054
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,800
public research like that's good that we

1055
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,920
are approximating and understand

1056
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
ideas

1057
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,359
and lastly

1058
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,119
i think there's still room for

1059
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,599
improvement on detection and closure um

1060
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,520
i chose the monocle because like you're

1061
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,760
searching and if you were not aware i

1062
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
haven't been informed by project zero's

1063
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,240
manager tim willis this is not praying

1064
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,320
hands emojis but they're actually high

1065
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,040
fives so let's do some teamwork

1066
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,240
but

1067
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,640
through this whole thing like

1068
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,839
i don't know what do you think i

1069
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,400
i can always have my mind changed

1070
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,960
and i think looking at this and talking

1071
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,079
with folks i do always

1072
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,079
notice that there's a lot of different

1073
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,560
interpretations of what we're seeing

1074
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
what the data looks like

1075
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,560
based on different sort of

1076
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,880
expertise and things like that so come

1077
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,599
find me come chat but all of my team

1078
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,119
members and friends will tell you that i

1079
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,800
could talk about this stuff forever and

1080
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
ever and ever

1081
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,599
so yeah that would make me happy if you

1082
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,280
want to chat

1083
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,000
and lastly if you want to get involved

1084
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
these are my hopes and dreams

1085
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
so i think these are areas of very

1086
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,240
practical progress that i would like to

1087
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,680
see start to change in the next year of

1088
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,760
one that we are able to have a root

1089
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,440
cause analysis patch analysis and

1090
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,680
variance analysis performed on every in

1091
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,280
the wild zero day

1092
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
i i wasn't even close for 20

1093
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,000
20 21 but we do accept

1094
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
pull requests on the public

1095
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,079
github repo where we host all of these

1096
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,000
and so i love it if you want to get

1097
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,079
involved you know happy to talk over

1098
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,000
bugs that might be a good fit if you

1099
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,599
want to just get started with this type

1100
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,880
of work

1101
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,319
yeah

1102
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,720
two that exploit samples are shared more

1103
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,119
widely because that's an important piece

1104
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,280
of the puzzle how are bones actually

1105
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,319
being exploited versus just what is the

1106
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,200
goal

1107
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,920
and even if maybe asking for them

1108
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,400
publicly shared is a step too far right

1109
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
now sharing them with folks or

1110
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,319
publishing details about how that

1111
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,040
exploitation method works because at

1112
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,200
least then there's the technical details

1113
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,000
available to evaluate

1114
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,680
lastly

1115
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,760
it's been i'm actually a little shocked

1116
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,920
of just how big a difference i think

1117
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,000
android and apple annotating their

1118
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
security bulletins this year made and so

1119
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,119
seeing if we can get more vendors to

1120
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,760
transparently annotate that because even

1121
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,400
if i take a step back out of my security

1122
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,920
research role

1123
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,359
as a user

1124
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,359
i want to know if there is any knowledge

1125
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,839
that a bowl they're patching or issuing

1126
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,240
patches for on my device has been

1127
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,480
actively exploited each and every one of

1128
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,640
us have different threat models and so

1129
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,400
by providing that information i think is

1130
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,119
a very important piece of it

1131
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,960
and lastly more and more and more

1132
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,680
detection i think we've really just

1133
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
started to

1134
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,079
um

1135
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,880
take first steps into what does

1136
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,599
detection research look like i don't i

1137
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,359
think it's going to have to get super

1138
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,200
creative

1139
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
with new

1140
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,359
risky not risky but like kind of out of

1141
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,680
the box thinking for us to have success

1142
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,000
in this

1143
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,160
and lastly

1144
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,440
thank you um i'm maddie stone

1145
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
yeah and i think i did leave time for

1146
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,160
questions

1147
00:42:50,160 --> 00:43:00,399
[Applause]

1148
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,160
are y'all really going to just make me

1149
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,920
stand up here

1150
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,560
go to the mic

1151
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,480
hi um i'm wondering if you could tell us

1152
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
more about what you think vendors could

1153
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,400
do in coming years as opposed to what

1154
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,720
they've been doing in the past

1155
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,160
thanks

1156
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,040
not my manager

1157
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,319
so i think

1158
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,680
so the year in review from 2020 actually

1159
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,000
was that 25 of the zero days in the wild

1160
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,240
that year were variants

1161
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,520
of previously known volumes and

1162
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,480
i

1163
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,640
i think that

1164
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,720
while maybe there was progress there i

1165
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,040
didn't feel comfortable giving us a

1166
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,200
number on that this year because i would

1167
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,599
feel like i would need to have done

1168
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,480
detailed analysis of all 57 exploits to

1169
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,880
that level and i didn't

1170
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,359
and so i think that is still an area a

1171
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,440
lot of vendor security teams aren't

1172
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,119
doing the detailed root cause analysis

1173
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
they're still trying to break

1174
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,000
pox or exploits they're not looking to

1175
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
see if that bug pattern exists in other

1176
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,920
places you know that's part of the

1177
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,960
reason why we've had two in 22

1178
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,920
in the wilds in 2022 so far and both are

1179
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,720
kind of similar to bugs in the wilds we

1180
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,319
saw in 2021 the first one was in

1181
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,440
windows

1182
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,920
and the second one was an i o mobile

1183
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,359
frame buffer

1184
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,240
second more transparency like i also

1185
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,520
think that

1186
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
it would be great if vendor security

1187
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,040
teams are the ones publishing these root

1188
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,880
cause analysis patch analysis variant

1189
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,599
analysis and it's not following falling

1190
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,839
on 30 part e teams that this is just

1191
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,520
sort of a part of

1192
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,119
the responsibility of having um

1193
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,720
people trust you and use your products

1194
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,880
and put all of their data and sort of

1195
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,079
livelihood on there in life um

1196
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,400
so yeah those are some of them

1197
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,319
oh

1198
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,400
hi uh thank you very much for your talk

1199
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,560
uh really interesting i wanted to ask uh

1200
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,480
one of the slides had a

1201
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,319
point that um

1202
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,720
the question is whether we

1203
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,319
just know how to detect those things and

1204
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,640
that's why we're detecting or uh maybe

1205
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,839
that's what

1206
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,560
is out there and i think the answer to

1207
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
this depends a lot on

1208
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
uh how it is that we are detecting those

1209
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,200
things

1210
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,520
but obviously there wasn't a lot of

1211
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,119
information about this and i think it's

1212
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,960
also an important part of the

1213
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,359
kind of community-based uh uh research

1214
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,800
about this is to

1215
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,560
know and share the approaches that are

1216
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
used to detect those things so i was

1217
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,720
wondering if google or you've been you

1218
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
know familiar with those approaches and

1219
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,640
uh can share how um

1220
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
and what the google stance is about you

1221
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,599
know the future of detecting those

1222
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,480
things

1223
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,000
so y'all really

1224
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
wanted shane to answer that question and

1225
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,240
keynote huh

1226
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,119
i'm second best up here i mean one that

1227
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,280
that is google tags information so it is

1228
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,720
not mine to provide or share um

1229
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,760
and

1230
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
yeah i think that would be great from

1231
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,440
you know a defender point of view for

1232
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
sharing information

1233
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,119
all tides you know

1234
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,040
raising the i don't know what the boat

1235
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,960
tied thing quote was

1236
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,640
um but at the same time i do understand

1237
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,839
that

1238
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,079
especially if you find one really good

1239
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,359
technique

1240
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,520
when i put on my offensive hat the first

1241
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,040
thing i think is oh yeah if i knew about

1242
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,440
that that would be pretty easy to bypass

1243
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,079
so i think that's where figuring out

1244
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,960
what that balance may be

1245
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,200
one thing that i have done is talk to

1246
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,760
vendors just giving ideas if they talk

1247
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,280
about hey this is the problem i'm trying

1248
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,520
to solve i don't know what to do of just

1249
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,480
going okay cool if you're welcome we're

1250
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,880
happy to brainstorm ideas with you based

1251
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,319
on what information you're willing to

1252
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,480
share so i think that

1253
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
might be an approach for our folks to

1254
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,720
begin taking as well

1255
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,919
thank you very much makes sense

1256
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,890
uh so you mentioned

1257
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,200
[Music]

1258
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,680
hypothesizing that okay if we see more

1259
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,079
uh oh days and or we see fewer days in

1260
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,480
the wild we're probably seeing more in

1261
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,960
days uh do you guys have an interest in

1262
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,319
also

1263
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,000
you know tracking in days obviously

1264
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,200
that's less sexy but you know like

1265
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,280
i i mean i mean for the for the person

1266
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,359
using them right it's more attractive to

1267
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,480
use something that's a bit more

1268
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,680
disposable

1269
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,559
yeah so one clarification

1270
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,200
i do not think necessarily that it's

1271
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
definitely equal that if we see the

1272
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,880
number of zero days go down that

1273
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,800
definitely means everyone's moved to

1274
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,200
fishing or malware or in days for

1275
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,880
success

1276
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,559
but i do think it is something to keep

1277
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,400
in mind that especially where we are now

1278
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,680
i don't i

1279
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,559
feel like a sudden drop off in zero days

1280
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,960
would be indicators that you know we're

1281
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,720
not doing great things in security

1282
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,760
something we've

1283
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,240
something we've done has made a negative

1284
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,640
change whether that's less transparency

1285
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,599
detection whatever

1286
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,400
but

1287
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
i personally

1288
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,559
will not begin working on end days just

1289
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,319
because my whole role

1290
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,319
is to focus on

1291
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,640
zero days in the wild so i do know there

1292
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,240
are lots of different folks that i

1293
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,280
follow

1294
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,599
especially a lot of threat intel does

1295
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,960
focus on

1296
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,800
you know how are people getting in in

1297
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,480
general which does include a lot of

1298
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,640
those in days and other techniques so i

1299
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,720
think i will leave it to them

1300
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,640
and so i definitely play also into

1301
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,720
shane's slide of thinking zero days are

1302
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,640
everything but no

1303
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,280
yeah just because that's my role um

1304
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,599
and it's more than enough work i will

1305
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,559
probably stick to zero days

1306
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,920
um why do you think there's a reluctance

1307
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,440
to uh share the exploit samples publicly

1308
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,520
so i think it can release a lot of

1309
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,079
information so there were a lot of zero

1310
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,040
days

1311
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,000
reported anonymously this year and don't

1312
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,680
want to get too much into that because i

1313
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,400
think great it's reporting the data you

1314
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,319
know the fact that it was in the wild is

1315
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,839
being shared that is a huge win

1316
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,680
but i think when you share exploit

1317
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,800
samples

1318
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,480
there's a lot of caution

1319
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,160
and fear that

1320
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,800
maybe i haven't even realized what

1321
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,119
information this may give away about my

1322
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,599
techniques or who i am or what we're

1323
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,640
doing or things like that or is this and

1324
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,000
so i think that sort of unknown of

1325
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,800
could this have extra indicators or

1326
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,160
something in it that says oh yeah this

1327
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,640
is my setup to get things or this is how

1328
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,559
i detect or stuff like that you know

1329
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,240
obviously i don't know if anyone wants

1330
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,760
to come and talk about challenges and

1331
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,040
sharing information happy to do that too

1332
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
one other point is i think this was the

1333
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,800
first year where

1334
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,359
folks started to get some positive press

1335
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,440
talking about

1336
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,480
zero day exploits and

1337
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,400
vendors were not which is something i

1338
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,559
hope we can sort of start changing

1339
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,960
because you know if vendors keep getting

1340
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,640
hit in the press every time they've

1341
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,160
labeled something as in the wild that's

1342
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,440
not quite the incentive i'm going for

1343
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,359
but i do think for reporters and

1344
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,079
researchers there did tend to be more

1345
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,440
positive

1346
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,000
reinforcement more positive press when

1347
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,319
it's like oh yeah we've discovered this

1348
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,160
thing and stopped this thing so

1349
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
hopefully that trend will continue

1350
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,599
because i don't think it was like that

1351
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,160
previously

1352
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,079
cool

1353
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,620
alrighty well thank you all very much

1354
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,720
[Applause]

1355
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,799
you
