1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
uh hello everyone and welcome to day two

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,799
and

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
let's get started this is a quick

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,000
keynote but

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,599
we'll see where we go

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,759
so let's address the obvious question

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,599
here why is a thread intel guy at your

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,560
conference

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
and how the hell did he get a keynote

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
slot when there's all these actual real

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
exploit guys that didn't get a keynote

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
slot

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
so i used to be a offensive security

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,599
before coming to google 12 years ago i'd

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,160
never actually worked defense

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
i used to really enjoy the work i used

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
to do the exploits though i'm getting

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
pretty out of date now i think the last

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
exploit i did actually did have jump esp

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,399
in it

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,840
and

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
but somewhere along the line like i got

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,520
kind of through a series of events ended

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,719
up actually

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,120
running a threat intelligence team

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,879
and now what i do for a living and my

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,600
team does is actually track

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
and counter serious threats and i

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,039
occasionally tweet and blog about them

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,600
and all that stuff so again why am i

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
here at offensive con

32
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,480
so

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
i think it has something to do with some

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
of our more recent work so

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
mark in an interview is actually talking

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
about how

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,640
you know

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,799
vendors have amazing detections but also

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
groups like google tag my team

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,720
actually

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,640
is able to rumble offensive players and

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
being stealthy in 2021 is hard so my

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
world is obviously intersecting with

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
your world in some ways and that's

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,520
probably

46
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
why you got out of bed to talk to to

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,759
come and listen to my talk

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
so the keynote many of you may actually

49
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,560
want is okay here is exactly how tag

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
catches all your stuff and here's how to

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
avoid it

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,399
sorry like i'm not that nice to you all

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,200
but

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,159
i'm going to give you a different talk

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
instead and maybe a little bit of that

56
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,680
but the talk you're going to get is

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
what is the offensive security

58
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,439
researcher's place in this wider threat

59
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,200
landscape because that's what i

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
discovered going into looking at sort of

61
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
more geopolitical threat actors i do

62
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,240
think

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,759
you know you're part of this so you can

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,119
skip out if you're expecting the other

65
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,960
talk i won't be offended

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
so i kind of joke a bit about that

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,759
everybody has their own view of the

68
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,520
security community in the whole security

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
world and when you talk to somebody you

70
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
get their biases everybody thinks that

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,080
they're the center of their own story

72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
right so this is my sort of

73
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
tongue-in-cheek sort of understanding of

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
how avon researchers sees the world it's

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
like zero days that's probably like at

76
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
least 75 percent of everything that's

77
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,120
important then there's giving cool names

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
and logos to zero days then there's

79
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
arguing about disclosure and then

80
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,160
probably like you know maybe five

81
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,360
percent of the rest of anything that

82
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
matters in security you know it's all

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,959
that other boring stuff right

84
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,319
not exactly right i don't think anybody

85
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,599
actually believes that but i do think

86
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,360
there is a bias towards what you're

87
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
interested in bias towards what you're

88
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,920
working on

89
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
and so you can be overstated most of the

90
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
threats we look at actually aren't zero

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,879
days

92
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
and just to show that i'm fair i can

93
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,519
actually say that threat intel people

94
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
are equally as biased that they are all

95
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
about making guesses about attribution

96
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
and giving cool names and logos to

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
threat actors instead of exploits but

98
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
otherwise we're actually relatively

99
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
similar everybody's biased towards their

100
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,040
own world

101
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,560
so i do think there is actually

102
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
something fairly special about

103
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,959
exploitation though and that's something

104
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
why it interests me so much and why we

105
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,239
put some resources into it so this is an

106
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
skcd comic that's been going around for

107
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
a while but especially re kind of

108
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,040
created because of like log4j showing

109
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
that like you know

110
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,640
all the model digital infrastructure can

111
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
be like supported by like some really

112
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
small amount of you know maybe an open

113
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
source project so my variation of this

114
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
in sort of my mental model is and what i

115
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,560
see is there maybe this major hacking

116
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
operation against democracy activists

117
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,360
and that may be propped up by

118
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,200
just one zero day that's come out of

119
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
some researcher right and that they sold

120
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
it to nso so there is these sort of

121
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,799
small critical pieces and what could be

122
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,560
a really big operation

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,239
that covers like you know infrastructure

124
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
malware and social engineering and

125
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
phishing and geopolitics but like a lot

126
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,799
of this can be propped up by some of

127
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,720
these very technical small amounts of

128
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
work which sort of enter into

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,480
interacts with like the nature of this

130
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
conference

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
um before i move on though i'd like to

132
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
say there is actually more similarities

133
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
between offensive

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
research and threat intel than i

135
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
originally thought as somebody who has

136
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,040
made this transition like you think

137
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
about security in general

138
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,759
we actually have a world where everybody

139
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
has an opinion especially in the days of

140
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,199
cyber at the moment we have all these

141
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
thought leaders we have all these

142
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
vendors we have everybody who has an

143
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
opinion on what matters in security they

144
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,080
all have an opinion that their product's

145
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
going to save the world but there's

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
actually some lack of hard truth at

147
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,919
times and actually lack of ground truth

148
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,680
and i think both offensive security

149
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
gives you ground truth because

150
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
like if you can pop calc or pop shell

151
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
you're proving that this thing is

152
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,759
exploitable and vulnerable there's no

153
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
arguments about it similarly in my

154
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,720
threat intel world if i actually show

155
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,479
a foreign government or a cyber crime

156
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,840
actor actually

157
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,199
succeeding in exploitation in the

158
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,600
details of it then that is to me a lot

159
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
more valuable than

160
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,320
you know all this theoretical

161
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,919
theoretically an attacker could do this

162
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,360
and if i was the russian government i

163
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
would do that i can actually rock up to

164
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
the meetings going well actually this is

165
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,320
what the russian government did last

166
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
week and that actually sort of wins the

167
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
debate and allows us to focus on what

168
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,080
matters so i think i like both areas

169
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
because they have that sense of reality

170
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
so why should you care about this threat

171
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
world right like i miss doing sort of

172
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
vol research and offensive security

173
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,759
because you get to have these cool

174
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,479
technical problems and very pure

175
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
problems in times if you do it like

176
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
there's no arguing there's none of this

177
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
sort of like

178
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
you know shades of grey sometimes you're

179
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,360
either succeeding or not so you may ask

180
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,919
like why should you care and the answer

181
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,680
is that i'm going to try and convince

182
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
you the rest of this talk is that this

183
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,759
whole threat world is a game right it's

184
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
like in some ways the grand game of

185
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
geopolitics and many other games and you

186
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
may be in this game already and there's

187
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,720
a saying in poker that if you sit in on

188
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
a poker game and you don't see the

189
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
sucker

190
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
then get up because you're the sucker

191
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,560
so

192
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,039
maybe in like next 20 minutes or so i

193
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,720
can give you a few things to watch out

194
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
for to make sure that like if you are in

195
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,919
this game you're not the sucker in the

196
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,360
game at least and that would be a win

197
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
for me

198
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
so the first way that

199
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
you know offensive security people are

200
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
becoming more and more into this game is

201
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
that attackers and by attackers actually

202
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
mean you know government-backed

203
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
attackers like north korea are actually

204
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
directly targeting researchers so

205
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,000
suddenly

206
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
the research people are on the front

207
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,319
line

208
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,840
um

209
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,560
so we published on this last year

210
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
we actually you know published quite a

211
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,759
number of details about this targeting

212
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
by the north koreans

213
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,600
towards security research and exploit

214
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
developers

215
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
and the way they did this primarily was

216
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
actually targeting this community right

217
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,680
and the way that this community of

218
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
offensive researchers work right they

219
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,560
created the twitter accounts and like to

220
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
kind of build their profile they created

221
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
a blog which

222
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,599
kind of made them look like they were

223
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,280
doing some security research and then

224
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
they actually reached out to people and

225
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
i think potentially i think actually

226
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,319
pretty sure literally people in this

227
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,960
room saying that oh yeah i've got this

228
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,400
zero day i'm pretty sure it's a zero day

229
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,919
but i haven't quite got it working yet

230
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
can you help me out can you take a look

231
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
and you know some people bought like bid

232
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,599
at that right and so at that stage

233
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,800
they actually

234
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
pulled up this um

235
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
you know they actually provided some

236
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
visual studio files and project files or

237
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
whatever and it wasn't a super

238
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
sophisticated exploit for this part they

239
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
actually just had powershell commands in

240
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the visual studio file and they're able

241
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,960
to get some you know very established

242
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
and great security researchers by just

243
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
getting them to run the visual studio

244
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
file

245
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,319
so

246
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
more concerning though is that there was

247
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
actually

248
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,039
evidence that it did go beyond this that

249
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
they actually had succeeded and they

250
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,599
actually did have a full chain exploit

251
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
against chrome and windows 10

252
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,000
and we were never able to actually

253
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
get a hold of the actual exploit but

254
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
there's a lot of good evidence they did

255
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,759
have it and you know if i was betting i

256
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
was saying they probably didn't build

257
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,479
that themselves but they may have

258
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,840
actually succeeded in a previous

259
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,599
campaign against some of these

260
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
you know people developing exploits for

261
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
high-end sort of government work and

262
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,039
then they were actually repurposing it

263
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
for this work and that's really scary

264
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,919
right this is really like proliferation

265
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
so be safe out there all um there's a

266
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
couple of two very two very quick

267
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,199
follow-ups on this though it's like

268
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,280
after they got taken down and then they

269
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
came back when they came back they had

270
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,319
to rebuild up their stuff and they had

271
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,520
to come to new content and the new

272
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
content was to start tweeting about how

273
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,440
great tag is so these are actually

274
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
tweets by north korean threat actors

275
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
talking about my team and then they're

276
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
even retweeting me and job ads for my

277
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
team and like i would not have predicted

278
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,719
like you know a year before this that

279
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
i'd have like north korean followers

280
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
actually helping me drum up

281
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
sort of like press and hiring and

282
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
they're doing this even more weirdly and

283
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
i haven't gone too much into this it was

284
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
actually only like two days ago and

285
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
wired like one of the people who was

286
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,279
hacked by this now is actually saying

287
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
that they're engaging in automated

288
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
exploitation and hacking back and taking

289
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
north korea off the internet

290
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
um

291
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
i don't know i don't know what to make

292
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
of this but definitely a sign that makes

293
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
my point that like people are in this

294
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
game and it is a game and security

295
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,920
researchers are part of it

296
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
what's the second way not only is north

297
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
korea targeting you we are targeting you

298
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,480
too and by we i don't just mean google

299
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
tag project zero i mean generally

300
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,519
defenders are targeting

301
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,120
zero days specifically

302
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,480
so my team had a good year last year

303
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
doing this maybe a bad year for the

304
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
peoples whose exploits got burned here

305
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,000
but this is like 11 zero day that were

306
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
discovered actively in use by the wild

307
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,240
by threat actors that we reported and

308
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,519
got patched

309
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
and this is only actually

310
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
you know a small part of the overall

311
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,320
picture

312
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
um you know maddie stone and project

313
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
zero are tracking all the publicly

314
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,160
released zero days in the wild and it

315
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
was 57 last year

316
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
um so and this is this is growing and

317
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
that was a new record and i think matt

318
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
is talking later today on that

319
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
so why do we do this to you is it just

320
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,920
because we're mean and we just want to

321
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,440
like mess with you all

322
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
or is it because we're not patriotic and

323
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,399
we don't understand how

324
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
offensive security is like the greatest

325
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,040
thing ever and we're just terrible

326
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
people no i don't think so right firstly

327
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,600
we do it because it's fun like it's so

328
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
much more fun looking at new zero days

329
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,279
than looking at new phishing messages so

330
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,839
i do like we do a little bit of this

331
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,200
stuff um

332
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
but kind of as i said with that kind of

333
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,000
that you know cartoon earlier like i do

334
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
think zero days are fairly critical to

335
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,200
this work right

336
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
like if you think of all the other ways

337
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
we see people exploited day by day with

338
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,720
like fishing with malware social

339
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
engineering there's other things we can

340
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
do there right we can do awareness we

341
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
can do security keys we can do patching

342
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
we can fix almost everything else but

343
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
like if you start having attacks which

344
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
are you know zero days there's only so

345
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
much you can do around that so i think

346
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
it it does deserve a little bit more

347
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
resources than other things

348
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
i also think i always try and think of

349
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
like how can we actually hold back

350
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,440
adversaries in general

351
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
and

352
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,760
part of that is like thinking through

353
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,279
the constrained resources and if you

354
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,720
think of all the resources they need for

355
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
their attacks

356
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
i don't i think they can always find a

357
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
new software engineer to kind of build

358
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,839
the malware right they can just keep

359
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,519
hiring those people i think they're

360
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,839
always going to be able to find

361
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,120
boxes on the internet they're always

362
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
going to be able to find email accounts

363
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
i think one of the most constrained

364
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
resources for an attacker is actually

365
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
zero day so if we actually want to sort

366
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
of constrain attackers that might be one

367
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,839
of the areas to focus and that's my

368
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,240
hypothesis as we go into this that

369
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,640
hunting zero day and getting patched

370
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
will lead to overall better security

371
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
um

372
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
so being offensive con though i thought

373
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,800
i'd actually better have a side note of

374
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,920
like why do i actually believe that

375
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
security is a good thing at almost any

376
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
other conference i wouldn't but i

377
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
thought like i at least want to defend

378
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,279
why free-for-all hacking is not the best

379
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,560
thing in the world

380
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
so bias of course like

381
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,440
unlike in past days now i actually get

382
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
paid to make things more secure and

383
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,639
insecurity is bad for my employer's

384
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,200
business so that's part of it but more

385
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
generally i do believe that

386
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
you know

387
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,240
a more secure world on the whole is a

388
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,760
better world

389
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,920
um you know i'm like a sci-fi geek

390
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,519
growing up as a kid right i believe in

391
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,680
all this like cool technological future

392
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,279
i want to see us go to space i want to

393
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,000
see

394
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
advances in medicine i want to see

395
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,839
advances in finance i want to see really

396
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,360
cool technological advancements of the

397
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
human race

398
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
and

399
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,519
i have this you know fear in the back of

400
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
my mind now that

401
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
so much of

402
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
what the human race needs to achieve

403
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
actually is sitting on top of this

404
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,240
digital infrastructure and the internet

405
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
and if it's not at all secure and we

406
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
can't secure it even a little bit then

407
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
that actually really could hold back

408
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,399
some really important things

409
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,920
i'm really starting to see that with

410
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,360
like um

411
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
ransomware hitting healthcare in a

412
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
pandemic and many other things that like

413
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
total insecurity is not great so

414
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
i'm not naive though i am not like a

415
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,200
black and white person right i'm not

416
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,639
saying that like

417
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
you know everything is always one way or

418
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
the other but i do think the balance has

419
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
shifted and definitely seeing evidence

420
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,399
that balance has shifted that

421
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,360
attacks are too easy even for actors

422
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
you know like north korea which are very

423
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,519
unpredictable if attacks are really easy

424
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
for them that's not a good sign for the

425
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
world and another good sign i think the

426
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
really good example is

427
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
you know forced entry

428
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,760
exploit against ios like last year right

429
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
they this was an exploit that was there

430
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,800
for multiple months zero click zero

431
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
interaction against ios devices from an

432
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
actor that was you know supplying to

433
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
many countries who seem to be doing very

434
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
irresponsible things and i don't think

435
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
this is a really good world where like

436
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,920
many actors are running around with this

437
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
capability and that like everybody just

438
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
has to assume that these phones which

439
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
you know people live their lives on

440
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
these phones and becomes like an

441
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
out you know

442
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
part of this sort of like world and

443
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
brain like a second brain and suddenly

444
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,320
that's like exposed to anybody who can

445
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
like pony up some money to a commercial

446
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
surveillance vendor so

447
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
i can justify why i'm pushing back on

448
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,120
this a little bit here

449
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
second one is i do i mentioned this a

450
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
little bit too incentives matter right

451
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,959
so we're not about just fighting back

452
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,639
the individual bits and pieces finding

453
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,240
back individual bugs

454
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
i think we also need to think about how

455
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,279
to shift the incentives across the

456
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
industry across the world to actually

457
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,880
lead to better outcomes

458
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
and one of the ways an example of this

459
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
is that we you know quite a number of

460
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,440
years ago google you know changed the

461
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
policy that you know we don't give 90

462
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,600
days deadline if we discover a zero day

463
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
actively being used in the wild against

464
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,839
people right you now get seven days

465
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,600
before we give you before we're going to

466
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,920
release the details and patch and you

467
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
know this led to a lot of pushback a lot

468
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,079
of like wailing and gnashing of teeth

469
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,000
but like it really has shifted the

470
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,440
industry right like last year we got

471
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
this great response from apple like we

472
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,519
like claiming my team found this exploit

473
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,160
being used in the wild we reported apple

474
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
and then like within seven days a new

475
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
dot release of ios was released and

476
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,720
being pushed to all users and users were

477
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
being protected from that this is a

478
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
great win and i think it's sort of like

479
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
the virtual cycle that comes from the

480
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,839
creating the right incentives for the

481
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,399
right things to happen so

482
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,000
coming back to the main part of my talk

483
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,399
off these side notes now is all this

484
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,079
sounds great right but is this actually

485
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,519
working am i actually having an effect

486
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,800
on this world are the people finding

487
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
zero days having effects

488
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
um

489
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,680
we've count the number of zero days know

490
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,959
that we have a record but is that

491
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,639
because we're finding them more i'll let

492
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,399
other people debate that

493
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,800
i do think there is some hope

494
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
i think we've got people's attention

495
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,279
right like the fact that i'm standing

496
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
here on this stage at offensive con

497
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,399
actually means that

498
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,240
somebody's taking some notice and some

499
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
interest and we're having some effect

500
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,399
somewhere or at least we're interested

501
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
um i think it is raising the skill bar

502
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,800
and i think that's even if we only do

503
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
that i think it is a good thing even if

504
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
we just make it so

505
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
the people with good zero days don't

506
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
leak them out everywhere that in its own

507
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,880
right would be a good thing because at

508
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,480
least then only the people who developed

509
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,920
them would have them as opposed to

510
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,440
everybody else who finds them lying

511
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
around the internet

512
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
um but i do think we can actually raise

513
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
the skill bar here i don't think we'll

514
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,720
ever eliminate zero days from the world

515
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,839
but i think we can make it harder than

516
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
we do today i do think this work is just

517
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,360
getting started i don't think it's we're

518
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
going to do a little bit more on this

519
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
but again it's a small part of my world

520
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,839
but i do think more people are going to

521
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,199
do this i think more people should do

522
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,160
this i think this is exciting

523
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,279
and i think it's a lot of exciting real

524
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,959
technical interesting problems in this

525
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,759
um

526
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
so if you do want to like think about a

527
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,639
bit of a shift and try and work out how

528
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
to do this i think it's a great green

529
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
field so go team blue

530
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,880
so now we get the less technical sides

531
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,240
of this

532
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,199
but just as important i think

533
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,560
the other way that you can get in the

534
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
game and in the game in a very bad way

535
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
is you know when accountability comes

536
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
knocking for work in the offensive

537
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
security world

538
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
um and we're seeing more of this right

539
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,880
of people getting caught out because

540
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
they've crossed a line in some ways

541
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,800
because the line's moved

542
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
we have here the um

543
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
you know this is dark matter

544
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,519
so this is a bunch of you know ex-us

545
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,519
intelligence operators that ended up

546
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
going working for a company in uae and

547
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,240
supplying uae with like capabilities and

548
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,079
allegedly doing hacking and you know on

549
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,439
the right is

550
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
you know the actual you know

551
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,959
technical term indictments or charge

552
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,240
sheets or whatever whether like the

553
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
federal charges for

554
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,599
export regulations and for criminal acts

555
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,760
right so this is a fairly egregious case

556
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,280
but the

557
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
you know thing to think about is there

558
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,799
is a whole continuum here

559
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,600
and where you sit on this continuum is

560
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
something to really think about and i

561
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,080
think

562
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,679
we're seeing across the board things

563
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,360
that would not have been gotten

564
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,200
attention getting attention now and that

565
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,559
consequences

566
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,480
could be coming and to should look

567
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,760
forward

568
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
also like at company levels a lot of

569
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,520
drama at the moment from like you know

570
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
u.s sanctions and this causing like the

571
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
actual business of nso to really

572
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
struggle at the moment

573
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
so thinking about that coming from very

574
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
high levels

575
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,600
i don't think it's just us either this

576
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
is example from like eu are doing

577
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
special commissions and you know

578
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
recommending sanctions and other actions

579
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,640
coming out of europe as well so this is

580
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
not just a u.s thing

581
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,360
um and why is this happening and i think

582
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
you know part of the reason this is

583
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
happening too is that

584
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
like some of these commercial

585
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
offensive players are somewhat getting

586
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,600
out of control right like you know it

587
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
was kind of

588
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
reasonable like a few years ago when

589
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
like everyone's sort of claiming you

590
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,000
know the only way this any of this

591
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,760
offensive research is being used is to

592
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
like you know track terrorists and save

593
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
lives but like you know when week after

594
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
week it's sort of exposed that no it's

595
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
democracy activists know as journalists

596
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
you know it's people targeting their

597
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
political opposition in democracies like

598
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,919
it becomes a lot harder and then it's

599
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,440
getting a lot more attention from the

600
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,360
people who want to do something about it

601
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,799
so you know like a sort of manager guy i

602
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,480
end up doing a lot of meetings with

603
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,679
government people on different topics

604
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,080
and threats and these commercial

605
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
commercial vendors and policy people

606
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,559
really all know about these actors and

607
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,679
are really thinking about this problem a

608
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
lot at the moment so expect a lot of

609
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
evolution in this space i also think

610
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,679
just the general pressure from you know

611
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,919
the books about

612
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,480
the zero day market the you know effects

613
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
of ransomware

614
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
the just everything that's happening in

615
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,440
the world like you know 10 years ago you

616
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,559
talked to a politician and they wouldn't

617
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
have any opinion on hacking whatsoever

618
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,840
now you're seeing stuff coming out of

619
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,200
the white house or whatever that you

620
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
know software supply chain

621
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
and

622
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
um you know open source patching and

623
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,559
commercial surveillance vendors are

624
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,880
actually like quite up the agenda out of

625
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
like top politicians and legislative

626
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,200
agendas so

627
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
that's that's something that is new and

628
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,720
continuing

629
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,559
so i think the norms are going to change

630
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
so i i'd keep an eye on it right just

631
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,320
like because something was like it was

632
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
totally cool to do in 2010 or 2020 like

633
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,679
will it still be cool in 2025 when they

634
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,280
change the rules

635
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
watch out for that and i think

636
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
individuals should look at their own

637
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,240
risk as well depending on like who

638
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
you're working for and what you're doing

639
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
like you should be looking at like okay

640
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
you can't just trust that your employer

641
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
is a great guy or girl and do you have

642
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
to think about okay am i going to face

643
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,039
any legal risk am i going to be the

644
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,559
sucker at the table here

645
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,919
like and also

646
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
as things change like and as things more

647
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,679
get out of what's the reputational risk

648
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
to you too right like how is some of

649
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,640
these things going to look on your

650
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
resume even if you do claim that oh no i

651
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
just i was just sitting behind

652
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
you know ida pro doing this work

653
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
like the last point is like you know

654
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
that ignorance and naivety is becoming

655
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
less of an excuse right so the people

656
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
sort of expecting people to think about

657
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
what they're doing here so the last bit

658
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
of this is

659
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
um

660
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
just thinking about how like you know

661
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
zero days and offensive capability is a

662
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,200
strategic asset right

663
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
it's

664
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
you know

665
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
intentions in the world now like you

666
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
know i am not a big like you know cyber

667
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,200
war guy whatever but

668
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,559
it is you know

669
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,360
undeniable that sort of like

670
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,520
you know cyber operations or hacking

671
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,039
operations or whatever you want to call

672
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,280
them actually are becoming a part of

673
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,039
geopolitical conflict it is becoming a

674
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,720
part of due political espionage actually

675
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,120
has been for a long time so these things

676
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,159
actually really matter and these

677
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,919
capabilities are starting to be

678
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,760
strategic capabilities like other

679
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,240
military capabilities are

680
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,480
um and you know if

681
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
it's not totally obvious like you can

682
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
also just like infer that this is

683
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480
changing by how certain countries are

684
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
treating this work right like you know a

685
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
couple of years ago you'd go to

686
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
ponderone and there'd be like all these

687
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,159
amazing chinese researchers there you

688
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,280
know

689
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,720
sort of like running the board getting

690
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,400
their exploits out there but then those

691
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
exploits you know through ponderone or

692
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,600
whatever would actually go to the

693
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,360
vendors and they get patched and then

694
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
suddenly a couple years ago none of the

695
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
chinese researchers can now go

696
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,520
and now it's like tianfu cup where they

697
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,799
are still going after all the same

698
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,320
targets which happen to be things that

699
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
are really good strategic for chinese to

700
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
have hacking capability against and

701
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
those exploits aren't necessarily coming

702
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,480
to the vendors after all right so

703
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
you know

704
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,679
they're not dumb here right they they

705
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,280
know the value of these things and

706
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
they're creating again the incentives to

707
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
actually make it work and to make it

708
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
work in their favor and then and they're

709
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
still being super successful right like

710
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
this is like a partial list of what just

711
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,400
came out of 1tm for cop

712
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,159
um and there's kind of somewhat real

713
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
consequences too like another example

714
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,559
from just this year or end of last year

715
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
is the like log4j exploit found by

716
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
alibaba cloud they actually did you know

717
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,799
what i would say and i think most people

718
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,320
would say is the right thing of actually

719
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
reporting this to the

720
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,159
sort of maintainers to get patched but

721
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,000
then they're actually you know suffering

722
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
sort of at least you know some pushback

723
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
and pull of support from the chinese

724
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
government because they actually got

725
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
this critical infrastructure patched as

726
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
opposed to you know telling them about

727
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,559
it so it's definitely a warning shot of

728
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,159
what they should do next time from these

729
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,159
security researchers

730
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,080
um

731
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
so

732
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,559
what am i saying here is the like you

733
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,159
know i'm trying to like inflate your

734
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,080
egos a little bit here too of the like

735
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
the work you do here are actually gonna

736
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
have really big influence

737
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,760
so this wouldn't be a keynote if i i

738
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
think when i read my sort of keynote

739
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,559
manual they say you're meant to come up

740
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,760
with like a bunch of predictions that

741
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,360
you can't which are probably wrong and

742
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,679
that i can't back up but it is the rules

743
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,640
so i'm going to give you a couple

744
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
predictions here about where i think all

745
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,600
of this is going

746
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
um

747
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,240
and hopefully i've proven most of these

748
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,600
already right so prediction one is that

749
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,799
i think it is going to get harder to use

750
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,080
zero day without getting caught right

751
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
like i don't think people were actively

752
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,600
hunting and looking and detecting as

753
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,520
much as they were i think people are

754
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
going to continue to do that it's going

755
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
to be good it's going to act as a nice

756
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,440
limiting force and balancing force

757
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
so i think that's something to be

758
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
prepared for

759
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
um that

760
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,360
you know it's not just a matter of

761
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,640
getting past the automatic

762
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
mitigations these days or finding that

763
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,039
combination of exploit chain to get

764
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,840
execution that actually working out how

765
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
to run the gauntlet of being detected in

766
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
the process by the platforms or some

767
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
other mechanism will actually become a

768
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
more important part of being a threat

769
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,279
actor

770
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,320
um cover this that i do think the legal

771
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
and geopolitical pressure on offensive

772
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,520
tech will increase

773
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,679
um not necessarily in a good way either

774
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,440
right like you know i'm

775
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,600
like you know whenever

776
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,000
whenever i see like whenever politics

777
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,120
gets involved and whether i see

778
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
legislators like passing laws or

779
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
whatever like i wouldn't guarantee that

780
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
it's all going to be good laws right or

781
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,120
well-written laws i think there is

782
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,279
actually you know it's going to be a

783
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,360
different world in a changing world but

784
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,039
we have to be prepared for anything here

785
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,440
and you know prepared for crypto wars 2

786
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
or laws that may have unintended

787
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,039
consequences

788
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,360
but you know this isn't going away time

789
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,919
soon given the high priority present

790
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,720
think of this a lot but i do think

791
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,279
we are seeing like a reinvestment a bit

792
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,799
more on secure systems both on the

793
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
technical side of like some mitigations

794
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
coming down

795
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
coming coming through but also just on

796
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,840
the

797
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,919
prioritization of making things secure

798
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
right like i think there's been like

799
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,400
some real big lessons learned on

800
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
sort of big hacks and ransomware and

801
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,880
everything else and open source and the

802
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,960
soul solarwinds hack that

803
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,760
you know

804
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,039
the

805
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,799
governments and others are doing a good

806
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
job actually making the incentives a bit

807
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,880
more towards that having a secure system

808
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,080
is going to cause you less problems in

809
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
the long term and that's going to

810
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,559
creating more opportunities for

811
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,760
investment for people to make things

812
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,840
more secure my last prediction is that

813
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
like i would not be worried that

814
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,120
technical challenges and interesting

815
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
technical work is going away anytime

816
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,039
soon i think there is plenty of

817
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,559
opportunities to

818
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,520
kind of

819
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
you know the technology is only going to

820
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
get better and more fun and i noticed

821
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,640
that today i still dabble in this stuff

822
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,240
on the weekend looking at like probably

823
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
beginner ctfs these days and like you

824
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
know it's it's amazing what is happening

825
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
in this community and i've really

826
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,679
enjoyed watching the talks here and i

827
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,400
enjoy watching how this technology

828
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
evolves

829
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
so i will get off the stage very quickly

830
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
and then hand over to actual

831
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,440
you know people doing serious technical

832
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,320
work and really exciting exploit stuff

833
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,559
but i suppose my closing sort of like

834
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,760
thought on this is

835
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,600
um

836
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
i'm not here like it's to just

837
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
hopefully i've just given you this taste

838
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
to think about this world right to think

839
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
about

840
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,520
just in a little bit about where you fit

841
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,320
in and maybe i'm kind of asking you to

842
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
think about that as you go forward as

843
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,679
well like

844
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,640
you many of the people here and in this

845
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
world

846
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
your work could have a real effect in

847
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
different ways on yourself on

848
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,440
individuals on governments or the world

849
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
that sort of like where the sort of like

850
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,880
the brains and power is applied

851
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,159
can make a difference in different

852
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,880
directions maybe more than you think so

853
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,799
i'm not here to say like do one thing

854
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,080
versus the other thing make all these

855
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
judgments and to admonish anyone in

856
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,039
particular

857
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,840
but

858
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,279
i do think you know with great power

859
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,919
comes great responsibility that

860
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
you do have choices right if you're a

861
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
great exploit researcher developer you

862
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
could apply it in a bunch of different

863
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
ways right you could go work for someone

864
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
like dark matter you could go work for

865
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
your national government you could go

866
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,840
work for

867
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
you know project xero and get things

868
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
patched or a whole or you could work on

869
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
mitigations with intel's there's a whole

870
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,559
bunch of different ways you could attack

871
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
this problem so i'm just asking you to

872
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,240
like

873
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
think about it and make sure you make

874
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,039
the decisions that you're comfortable

875
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,279
with and the decisions that like

876
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
you think is doing better for yourself

877
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,840
and everyone else and not just to be

878
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,520
that naive sucker at the table that

879
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,039
doesn't think about what they're doing

880
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,919
