1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
half years ago I decided it's time to do

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,939
something else and not think about

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,890
security for a while and I was

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,410
surprisingly successful at not thinking

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,230
about security in the last 15 months so

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,839
now I'm giving this talk here at a

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,820
conference for security having not

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,640
thought about the topic much in recent

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,189
months my solution to coming up with

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,930
something to say then is take the things

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,640
I would normally ramble about over beers

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,740
with people individually and condense

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,359
them into a talk it's a bit of the the

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,570
scalable version of having a beer with

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,579
each of you individually right so this

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,750
is going to be a rambling talk and a

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,520
quite personal talk and as you saw the

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,260
title the title is why I love offensive

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,440
work and why I don't love offensive work

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,730
and I think an important part or

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,010
important thing for me to mention about

22
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,769
my personality is somebody I worked with

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,120
once asked hey how far is it not really

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,350
strenuous to have a love/hate

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,570
relationship with everything and while

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,710
this isn't precisely true of everything

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,030
there's a few things that I actually

28
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,250
quite liked and a few things that

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,710
actually quite unambiguously dislike it

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,360
is true that for most things I have a

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,699
complicated or complex relationship with

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,439
it and security is a complex topic and

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,750
this keynote is going to be a reasonably

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,449
personal recap of my complex

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,740
relationship with security because it's

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,360
a personal talk I'm quite sure that

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,520
everybody's personal experiences and

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,720
opinions will defer so I think there's

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:39,030
going to be plenty to disagree with we

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,860
shall see we shall see so let me begin

41
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,420
with all the reasons or not all the

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,960
reasons but at least ten reasons why I

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,210
love offensive work and there's many

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,280
good reasons some of which are technical

45
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,839
reasons some of which I canonic reasons

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,460
and some of which are emotional regional

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,100
reasons and I'll begin with the

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,839
technical reasons and on the technical

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,390
side offensive work is awesome because

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,409
it is so full-stack meaning like if

51
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,689
anybody talks about full-stack

52
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,950
engineering security really is false

53
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,439
like engineering because the security

54
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,690
flat floors always hide at the borders

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,760
between abstraction layers and that

56
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,720
means that as a security person you get

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,590
to look at all these different

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,550
abstraction layer

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,410
and in some sense the cynical person

60
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,910
would say that the only person in

61
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,530
computing that is paid to actually

62
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,870
understand the system from top to bottom

63
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,540
is the attacker everybody else is

64
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,950
usually paid to understand their part so

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,769
the beauty one of the beautiful things

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,869
about offensive work is you get to play

67
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,370
at every abstraction layer and you get

68
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,870
to look at every abstraction layer and

69
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,580
you get paid to actually understand the

70
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,810
different destruction layers and there's

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,489
so many of them and it's fascinating

72
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,500
we're going from the physics of the

73
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,780
hardware the the vagaries of the

74
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,030
manufacturing process all the way

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,890
through the operating system through

76
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,750
libraries through the implementation

77
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,589
through the high-level logic through

78
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,239
things like Unicode homework live

79
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,239
attacks and so forth which are really on

80
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,760
the the very top abstraction layer

81
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,319
another good technical reason is it's so

82
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,260
broad when it comes to the techniques

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,549
you employ meaning you've got all these

84
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,250
interesting questions of program

85
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,590
analysis stuff like data flow analysis

86
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,269
abstract interpretation all of these

87
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,130
very academic things when you do

88
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,720
exploitation you get to play with data

89
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,280
structures and algorithms at a level

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,320
that most people never play with them if

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,730
you corrupt a pointer in a tree and then

92
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,450
have to still insert and remove things

93
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,790
from the tree

94
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,798
that's super fascinating you do a lot of

95
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,209
really interesting engineering when it

96
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,670
comes to dynamic instrumentation of

97
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,680
software that's really awesome systems

98
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,929
engineering like building a big fuzz

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,310
farm there's actually a lot of clever

100
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,870
systems engineering that goes into it

101
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,570
you can argue that one of the strengths

102
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,620
of AFL wasn't the ideas behind it but

103
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,840
the actual engineering of the

104
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,609
implementation you have to deal with

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,079
systems internals you get to look at

106
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,760
cryptography that's essentially

107
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,350
everything that's cool and computers put

108
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,600
into a bowl and you get to play with it

109
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,700
that's awesome another thing that's

110
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,760
great as spelunking in the ancient ruins

111
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,290
of the Elders software like we build

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,489
software like we build our cities which

113
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,929
means we built on the trash and the

114
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,030
ruins of the previous generations and

115
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,900
they're still below where we're living

116
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,310
right so a lot of software analysis is

117
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,079
digging into these old cathedrals

118
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,340
they've been built 20 years ago and

119
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,108
trying to figure out what they're doing

120
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,760
it you sometimes feel like indiana jones

121
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,548
going into an old code base trying to

122
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,630
figure out what's going on so there's a

123
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:26,070
lot to love on the technical side and

124
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,360
another thing i really really like is

125
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,699
the creativity of

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,020
vulnerability developments in my my

127
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,729
training stars I usually tell people

128
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,500
that every individual little buggy you

129
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,469
find it's like a random piece out of the

130
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,300
IKEA warehouse and your job is to

131
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:41,449
assemble all these random pieces until

132
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,219
you can build a chair out of them and

133
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,689
the vulnerability X development process

134
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:47,879
is very much like this you take all

135
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:49,590
these really weird oddly shaped bugs and

136
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,189
you try to somehow assemble them between

137
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,568
something nice sturdy and useful and and

138
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,620
that's something I really like the

139
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:59,159
creative part is not to be

140
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,050
underestimated then there's another good

141
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:03,779
technical reason which is offensive work

142
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,340
really is on the boundary of what we

143
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,069
understand scientifically and the sense

144
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,989
that we're only like slowly getting to

145
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,340
grips with what it even even means of a

146
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,650
theoretical level to have a next point

147
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,568
and it's only in recent years that we've

148
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,340
got a reasonable understanding of what

149
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,409
memory corruptions really are on the

150
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,729
computer science level and we still

151
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,560
don't have a good model for stuff like

152
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,659
timing attack side channel attacks and

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,000
so forth and that's kind of exciting

154
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,889
because there's real new computer

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,289
science being explored and we're kind of

156
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,379
part of it and that's that's exciting

157
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:37,139
that's cool cool stuff there's work that

158
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:42,029
will possibly survive the next 3040

159
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:45,029
years another big technical thing that I

160
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:48,629
love is it's inherently practical

161
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:51,000
meaning work on offensive technology is

162
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,909
by and large not theoretical I studied

163
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,319
cryptography in university where you get

164
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:57,029
to congratulate yourself if you can

165
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,520
lower the theoretical complexity of an

166
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,800
attack from 2 to the power of 128 to 2

167
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,089
to the power of 110 nobody can ever

168
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,650
check your work because there's no

169
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,810
computer to ever try the two to the

170
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,628
power of 110 so nobody knows whether

171
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,319
it's actually true and the beauty of

172
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:15,150
offensive work is it's very very clearly

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,029
useful in some sense and it's very very

174
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,529
satisfying to see technology work and if

175
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,659
you're mean you can say that the

176
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,219
offensive side of security is a bit of

177
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,750
an outlier within the greater security

178
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:26,339
industry because the offensive side

179
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:32,189
consistently delivers products that

180
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:34,650
actually do what they advertise then

181
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:37,469
there's economic reasons why offensive

182
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,989
work is great offensive work has almost

183
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,190
perfect incentive alignment meaning your

184
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,830
success is almost

185
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,480
100% measurable and it's discrete it's

186
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,919
either you get the shell or you don't or

187
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,310
either you get codex like or you don't

188
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,500
and technical excellence is strongly

189
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,830
correlated with your income because it's

190
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,570
so directly measurable and that it

191
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,159
sounds weird but super rare in most

192
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,469
fields like one of the lies we tell to

193
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,910
children is that how good you are at

194
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,590
what you do actually matters in terms of

195
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,910
your income later in most industries

196
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:11,400
that is not true so offensive work has

197
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,320
the the nice property of having nice

198
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,780
like good clear alignment of incentives

199
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,280
for technical people the other thing is

200
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,799
that most vendors you're attacking

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,140
kind of care about fighting you but not

202
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,520
really all that much right they really

203
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,669
care about having their software in

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,190
everybody's pocket and they care enough

205
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,570
about fighting you to be a nuisance and

206
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,160
to be sure that they feel like they have

207
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,620
done something but their business isn't

208
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,940
fighting you their business is getting

209
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,920
that software into everybody's pocket

210
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,080
which means actually that if you have a

211
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,180
bug in somebody's software and they

212
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,800
don't know about it their incentives and

213
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,270
your incentives are aligned because you

214
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:52,169
want their software to be in everybody's

215
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:54,060
pocket too so the the thing is that

216
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:55,890
almost all offensive problems are

217
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,570
technical problems which means it's a

218
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,550
great industry to be in if your passion

219
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:05,430
is solving technical problems okay

220
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,320
another economic benefit or a good thing

221
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,690
about the economics of offensive is that

222
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,480
what you're selling is actually

223
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,030
mission-critical for customers what I

224
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,310
say is that the best products are those

225
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,190
products that the customer needs in

226
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,560
order to do their job most security

227
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,030
products are nice to have like no

228
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,830
business is going to grind to a halt

229
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,700
because they didn't update the antivirus

230
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,080
at least most of the time and the

231
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,789
business can continue without them and

232
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,530
the other thing really is if you sell

233
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,718
something that's critical for the client

234
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,689
that the client needs to have you don't

235
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,640
need much of a sales team if you do sell

236
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,640
something that's nice to have you become

237
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,410
a sales driven product and then you need

238
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,180
to have a large sales team and this is

239
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,980
why we have conference like RSA because

240
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,930
most security products are sales driven

241
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,200
because they're not actually essential

242
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,199
and

243
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,460
well the thing is that those people that

244
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,900
actually buy offensive stuff for these

245
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,370
people it's mission-critical to have

246
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,290
these things like they need these

247
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,830
products to do their job which means

248
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,719
overall the the offensive side is not

249
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,160
terribly sales driven which also plays

250
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,180
into the hands of people that like the

251
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,430
technical work another economic reason

252
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,920
that's a below bit a little bit amusing

253
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,989
about offensive work is the people that

254
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,589
buy offensive products buy these

255
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,110
products with other people's money we

256
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,910
have to look at this from like read this

257
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,890
diagram from left to right we've got the

258
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,079
device vendor and the device vendor

259
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:36,890
makes a big investment into making

260
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,260
devices harder to hack okay now the cost

261
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,400
for the offensive vendor to provide

262
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,220
offensive capabilities against this

263
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,800
device goes up so the offensive vendor

264
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,330
tells the security apparatus hey this

265
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,069
has gotten really expensive because the

266
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,110
vendor has made these investments we

267
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,300
need more money to do our job the

268
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,500
security apparatus needs more money but

269
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,660
it's not their money so they go to the

270
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,210
politicians and say hey we need more

271
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,829
money to do our job the politician then

272
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,950
goes to the voter and says do you want

273
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,380
to feel safe and by and large voters

274
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,960
want to feel safe and then they're okay

275
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,810
with being taxed so really the flow of

276
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:17,350
money here is that the offensive vendor

277
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:19,760
gets to tax the population and the

278
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,340
defensive vendor that makes things

279
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,900
harder doesn't necessarily actually

280
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,570
affect the offensive vendors bottom line

281
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,939
because the overall revenue of the

282
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,320
offensive vendor grows by things getting

283
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,450
harder because the sums involved are

284
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,340
bigger and if you assume constant margin

285
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,880
the offensive vendor actually makes more

286
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,589
profits as it gets harder to hack fix

287
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,360
that's a really really bizarre setup and

288
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,700
the most bizarre setup is the people

289
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,560
that I should decide about the giving

290
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,540
you like giving anybody the money for

291
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,939
the offensive tools are so far removed

292
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,689
from the actual prize negotiation that

293
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,310
there's no direct relation and that is

294
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,750
well in the in the end offensive tools

295
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:01,579
are bought by people that are not

296
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,770
spending their own money now there's a

297
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,860
whole bunch of emotional reasons why why

298
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,270
offensive work is interesting a math

299
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,130
professor once told

300
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,410
told me that the joy in mathematics is

301
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,029
often the receding of the pain which

302
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,730
means you work on a really hard problem

303
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,800
for a long period of time and then

304
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,630
finally in solve it and it's super

305
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,569
gratifying to push through on a hard

306
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,760
problem and this discrete nature of no

307
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,709
success no success no it's a sex success

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,980
that's emotionally and really powerful

309
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:33,709
and there's a certain hi to it and it's

310
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,260
very very intense and addictive to some

311
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,969
sense in some sense like I I don't think

312
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,220
I will ever forget the moment I got

313
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,750
double sided row hammering to work and I

314
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,070
was shaking and had to go for a walk

315
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,920
thereafter and there's a few moments in

316
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,510
life where working on a hard problem and

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,880
suddenly making progress gives you a

318
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,470
real push and a real high and I don't

319
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,939
think we should underestimate that a lot

320
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:58,160
of us really like that hi another

321
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,770
emotional reason that I I find very

322
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,410
powerful is that exploits are really the

323
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,000
closest thing to magic spells we have in

324
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,370
the this world you you have a

325
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,140
complicated technological device and you

326
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,459
find out the right incantation to yell

327
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,250
at the device to take control of the

328
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,890
device that is as close to magic as you

329
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,570
will ever get and even after 20 years of

330
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,790
being involved with exploits every time

331
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,820
I see a good expert work I'm like this

332
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,500
is magic and it is in in some sense and

333
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,850
also that's emotionally very very

334
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,830
powerful and the last last positive

335
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,779
reason on the emotional side for me has

336
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,160
always been the people security

337
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:38,180
particularly offensive security used to

338
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,790
be a backwater and most people you met

339
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,829
in that region in the early days were

340
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,069
primarily motivated by the curiosity and

341
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,200
some of them by a sense of duty but

342
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,350
their overarching ambition wasn't to

343
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,329
make the most money and that led to the

344
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,850
offensive community being a very very

345
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,560
interesting community of misfits often

346
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,779
with very very unique mutant powers in

347
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,920
the sense that different people in

348
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,470
offense have very very different

349
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,689
specialties and very different special

350
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,720
abilities as well and I've always found

351
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,190
that to be a very very reward rewarding

352
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,440
experience because you interact with so

353
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,000
many people that are Auto directs that

354
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,829
have taught themselves most of what they

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,570
know and then have a real passion for

356
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,790
learning and as somebody who likes being

357
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,110
around people that like learning that's

358
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,079
always been been

359
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,769
very very very important for me all

360
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,959
right now after talking about all the

361
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,870
things that are love about security I'll

362
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:36,699
make a few few detours three of them in

363
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:41,209
total and the first one is talking about

364
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,490
the question of how do you interact as a

365
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,930
scientist with the world especially when

366
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,670
your signs interacts with warfare and

367
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,920
why do I talk about this well to some

368
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,810
extent I perceive myself as a scientist

369
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,839
and engineer of sorts and as a teenager

370
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,268
I read governments the physicists and I

371
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,399
watched a play called Copenhagen in my

372
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,500
late teens and both of these plays

373
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,540
explore the interplay between signs

374
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,149
warfare and the greater societal

375
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,219
implications if you haven't read either

376
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,779
I recommend reading both or watching a

377
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,120
play for both they're absolutely

378
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:17,689
hilarious fascinating and worth looking

379
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,660
at and my personal background is that my

380
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,100
family is like both my parents went

381
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,800
through the Second World War and there's

382
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,649
a strong pacifist perspective in that

383
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,260
family but my extended family has a lot

384
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:33,019
of people that actually like serve in

385
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,209
the military somewhere and so my direct

386
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,850
family is very pacifistic and I had to

387
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,160
deal a lot with the question of why am i

388
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,800
making my living from essentially the

389
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,769
intelligence and military budgets

390
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,380
essentially from from age 19 onwards so

391
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:50,990
I always thought about how how does my

392
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,269
work relate to these things and as

393
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,970
somebody of almost age 40 clearly I was

394
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,980
14 when The Prodigy released their album

395
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,449
we're at the beginning of the sample I

396
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,000
need to take my work back on the ground

397
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:03,410
to stop it falling into the wrong hands

398
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,300
as an impressionable teenager you hear

399
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,699
that sample and you can't ever get it

400
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,339
out of your head entirely

401
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,390
so I read about these things and I

402
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,110
thought about these things and I

403
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,550
stumbled across a few weird examples

404
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,649
there's a fascinating book called

405
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,149
Hardee's or called a mathematicians

406
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:24,589
apology by a mathematician called Hardy

407
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:27,110
published in 1940 where he explores how

408
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:30,370
the sciences have been subjugated to

409
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,300
producing ever more vicious war fighting

410
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,649
looking at the experience of World War

411
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,550
one and so forth

412
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,180
and he then concludes that luckily

413
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,618
theoretical mathematicians and

414
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,868
theoretical physicists are safe because

415
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,189
no one has yet discovered any warlike

416
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:45,649
purpose to be served by the theory of

417
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:47,689
numbers or relativity and it seems very

418
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:50,600
unlikely that anyone will do so for many

419
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:54,709
years now we're speaking like he wrote

420
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,170
this five years before Hiroshima and it

421
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,899
was about 25 years thirty years before

422
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,809
RSA was invented but the point is that

423
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,480
what he deemed to be the most pure the

424
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,699
most untouchable and useless of Sciences

425
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,439
ended up being very very critical very

426
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:13,939
soon thereafter a second example is in

427
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:16,248
the early two-thousands I dated a social

428
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,779
anthropologist and she always made

429
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:18,980
vicious fun of the fact that all of

430
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,379
computer science and mathematics is

431
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,110
thoroughly militarized and financed by

432
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:28,309
by the state to essentially suppress

433
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,290
people and she wasn't wrong in some

434
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:32,240
sense but then the weird thing happens

435
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,219
that in 2007 during the Iraq war

436
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,110
Secretary of Defense gates starts the

437
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,579
Human Terrain system where the DoD hired

438
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,499
a whole bunch of social anthropologists

439
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:49,008
to unravel the tribal structure in Iraq

440
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:50,959
to better wage war right so the the the

441
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,240
conclusion you can draw for my major

442
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,429
offer from this is it's really really

443
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,589
difficult for the scientist involved in

444
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:59,480
the moment to predict what the effects

445
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,040
of the work that he does will be like

446
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,689
it's essentially impossible for me to

447
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,309
say what I do will not have military

448
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,668
applications or what I do will have

449
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:09,678
military applications the reality is

450
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:12,919
that the military's will use whatever is

451
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,360
useful in war and the only way to

452
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,949
prevent your work from ever being used

453
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,119
for military purposes is make sure it's

454
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:23,029
irrelevant or wrong or both so in

455
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,029
warfare both sides will take whatever is

456
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,949
useful and try to use it now while this

457
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:30,799
may be true that does not absolve the

458
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:32,390
individual from making like informed

459
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,090
choices about what he works on and why

460
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,909
he works on it meaning you have very

461
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,830
limited ability to see what is going to

462
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:42,880
happen to your work that doesn't mean

463
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:45,020
you don't have a responsibility to look

464
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,030
okay

465
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:52,410
next detour signs and conflicts is it

466
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:54,210
immoral to improve weaponry we generally

467
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,929
lead discussions from a perspective of

468
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,700
saying better weapons are always bad and

469
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:01,770
for me an important input to this

470
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,669
discussion was in 2016 I visited Japan

471
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,350
and both Hiroshima and Tanegashima now I

472
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,169
will not talk about Hiroshi MA

473
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,219
the only thing I can say that is if

474
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:14,450
anybody has a chance of visiting

475
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,299
Hiroshima and the the museum there do it

476
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,220
now Tanegashima Tanegashima is an island

477
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,100
in the south of japan and why is

478
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,740
Tanegashima important it is the place

479
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,530
where guns came to Japan for the first

480
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,980
time Japan didn't have guns and then at

481
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,570
some point during a vicious civil war

482
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,730
that had lasted for more than 70 years

483
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,290
already where entire generations of

484
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:42,090
young men had died a team of four a

485
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,790
small boat with a few Portuguese people

486
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,250
with guns landed or stranded on

487
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,379
Tanegashima and they sell their gun to

488
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,210
the local warlord and the local warlord

489
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,940
gives that gun to his blacksmith to make

490
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,429
copies of the gun so Japan is

491
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,890
essentially at about 80 years into a

492
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:01,049
vicious Civil War the first gun arrives

493
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,760
and then it takes a while for the gun to

494
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,929
actually be adopted the Japanese had had

495
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,840
trouble with some of the the

496
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:10,260
blacksmithing at the beginning and then

497
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:14,790
it gets fully adopted around 1575 and

498
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:17,850
then the war is over reasonably quickly

499
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,760
thereafter because one side had an

500
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,699
advantage to just kill the others and

501
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,790
win so in essence what we have here is

502
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,559
we have a hundred ten years of war ended

503
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,290
relatively quickly by the arrival or

504
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,590
within forty years ended by the arrival

505
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,590
of superior weaponry and that's a really

506
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,209
strange strange thing to to contemplate

507
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,409
on the right hand side is a picture I

508
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,720
took in the museum there the Japanese

509
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,520
after they had the first gun did a whole

510
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,980
bunch of very very weird experimentation

511
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,540
with what is actually a good gun as you

512
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,890
see this is a handgun with a caliber

513
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,780
like this and you have to fire it

514
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,500
kneeling down and then roll backwards to

515
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:58,500
deal with a recoil so the the question

516
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,800
that I cannot answer is whether Sapir

517
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,040
web

518
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,899
is actually always bad because what is

519
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,760
bad is prolonged warfare where nobody

520
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,280
can get an upper hand for generations

521
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,410
and it may be that superior weaponry

522
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,460
ends wars more quickly and it's also

523
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:16,680
like you could if you wanted argue that

524
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,480
nuclear weapons have maintained peace

525
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,750
because they're so terrible we don't

526
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,370
know I don't have an answer and I think

527
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,990
about Tanegashima and I have no good

528
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,189
conclusion to draw from it outside of

529
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,340
this is puzzling

530
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,630
there's also counter examples when the

531
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,699
same thing happened in New Zealand and

532
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,030
the first guns arrived the experience

533
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,530
was very very different the Maori waged

534
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,120
really really bad war on each other very

535
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,520
quickly thereafter with mass casualties

536
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,179
without ever having one side gained the

537
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,860
upper hand so we have two examples where

538
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,690
the same thing happened and with very

539
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,610
different outcomes it's also interesting

540
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,650
to contemplate that Japan ended up

541
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,159
entirely disarming itself again

542
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,840
thereafter after they had acquired peace

543
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,150
they gradually rejected guns and even

544
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,780
Fogg forgot how to make them up until

545
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:05,940
1800 it's super fascinating there's a

546
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,800
great book called giving up the gun that

547
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,660
tries to trace what the heck happened in

548
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,129
Japan that they decided to reject guns

549
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,220
as a thing and then even forget how to

550
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:16,440
make him and you know I don't know what

551
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,900
the lesson is except that saying that

552
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,530
weapons are always bad isn't quite the

553
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,660
right right level of this course okay

554
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:29,370
third detour the fragility of

555
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:31,290
democracies now during my travels in

556
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,469
2015 I visited a whole bunch of

557
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:37,139
countries and at some point I realized

558
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,940
and my wife me would realize every place

559
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,980
almost every place we had visited had

560
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,990
living memory of death squads and many

561
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,520
of these places are not place that you

562
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,230
immediately associate with living memory

563
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,660
of death squads but let's start with

564
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,250
from France during the Algerian war the

565
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,890
French Secret Service disappeared people

566
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,660
in Algeria and pioneered a technique

567
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,980
later taken up by the Argentinians

568
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,720
called death flights where you just make

569
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,490
sure that people disappear by you taking

570
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,290
them on a flight of the sea and dumping

571
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,650
them there no corpse ever shows up

572
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,540
people are just gone Morocco had more

573
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,270
than 740 disappearances under king

574
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,399
hassan ii assassinated people in paris

575
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,460
Uruguay arrested 20% of its population

576
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,429
at one point under the dictatorship

577
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:23,929
Argentina had 30,000 people disappear

578
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:26,270
South Africa had very very

579
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:28,410
well-documented torture and

580
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,389
assassination infrastructure during the

581
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,050
late days of apartheid which targeted

582
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,760
their own civil society like lawyers

583
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,530
that we're arguing against arbitrary

584
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,660
detention got killed

585
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,520
Portugal under sir Salazar it

586
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,830
disappeared people Spain had a more

587
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,650
northern 100,000 dead under Franco's

588
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:49,020
white terror 100k disappeared in the

589
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,960
following years Taiwan had people

590
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,590
disappear it just that almost every

591
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,420
country has death squads within living

592
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,139
memory there's still people alive that

593
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,240
were alive when that happened and it's

594
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,559
something we need to remember

595
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,429
democracies and basic rights are super

596
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,470
fragile and then not the norm and every

597
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,760
democracy is about to terrorists rights

598
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,690
and one opportunist away from a

599
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,700
dictatorship the other thing is

600
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,350
empirically state-sponsored death squads

601
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,660
happen and they happen with regularity

602
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,209
and all of us have grown up in a

603
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,100
particularly surprisingly peaceful point

604
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,380
in history in a peaceful area of the

605
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,750
world and that tends to bias our

606
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,520
judgment of what's happening meaning

607
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,890
we've only experienced peace and we've

608
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,330
only experienced rights and it's very

609
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,090
very important to keep in mind that that

610
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,159
is not everybody's experience and also

611
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,790
historically an anomaly and we don't

612
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,429
know whether it'll last all right so

613
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,350
let's talk about the issues I have where

614
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,390
I don't particularly love offensive work

615
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,809
I talked a lot about the reasons why I

616
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,880
love offensive work now there's some

617
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,350
societal reasons why I don't love

618
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,400
offensive offensive work there's some

619
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,678
emotional reasons and there's some

620
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,750
technical reasons the societal reasons

621
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,880
the very first one in perhaps the most

622
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,730
important one for me is the question for

623
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,059
whom and about 20 years ago I first met

624
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,410
Robert Morris senior and I admire the

625
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,178
person I admire the person when he was

626
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,610
alive and it was a fantastically

627
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,140
entertaining person to chat with and at

628
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,309
some point he asked me what I do and I

629
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,510
had just started that University

630
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:24,710
studying mathematics so I told him I

631
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:27,080
study math and his answer was foo

632
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,570
and I found that very confusing to be

633
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,750
like for me I go to university for whom

634
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,970
and this question for whom is one that

635
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,500
it's actually surprisingly important for

636
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,760
all of security because we have to

637
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,669
realize that all of security is

638
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,649
fundamentally about human conflict doing

639
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,990
security you're always on somebody's

640
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:47,870
side and this holds true for both

641
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,490
offensive and defensive work and the

642
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,529
reality is that if you're on somebody's

643
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,940
side and get paid you're usually on the

644
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:54,200
side of the powerful because of the

645
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,200
powerful you can have the money to pay

646
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,720
people so one of the things that I find

647
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,159
difficult with all of security is you

648
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,020
always pick a side and I'm sometimes

649
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:07,700
running out of sides that I want to pick

650
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,408
the second Society reason why I

651
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,059
offensive work can be can be

652
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,340
disappointing is there's essentially

653
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,570
three big career paths on the offensive

654
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,178
side and they all have different

655
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,309
downsides option one is the government

656
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,779
agency where you get to directly work on

657
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,029
the problems and the operations and so

658
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,740
forth and the positive is this impactful

659
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,659
work you have some insight and what's

660
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,299
happening with your work and so forth

661
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,460
there's a lot of cons to this though the

662
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:33,350
pay is relatively low there are a lot of

663
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,760
quite onerous restrictions on your

664
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,469
travel on your interaction with

665
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,390
foreigners your ability to work from

666
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,299
home and so forth

667
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,710
there's career advancement mostly at the

668
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,289
expense of actually doing technical work

669
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,710
where you have to to become a managerial

670
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,730
person in order to to advance and

671
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,200
increasingly you may end up not doing

672
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,789
the technical work but just manage

673
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,950
contractors that then provide you with

674
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:57,529
services so that's one option

675
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,659
not everybody's option you can go to a

676
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,820
defensive vendor where the salaries are

677
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,110
much better but then the trouble there

678
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,899
are the economic incentives where

679
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,908
usually for most offensive players their

680
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,529
profits are maximized when they sell to

681
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,760
the scummiest people because the

682
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:13,309
scummiest people have difficulty getting

683
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,220
these capabilities otherwise so they are

684
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,299
willing to pay the most money for it

685
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,409
another con working for an offensive

686
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,940
vendor is you not work in an

687
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:21,830
organization where top management has an

688
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,330
incentive to lie to you if you look at

689
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,070
hacking team hacking team told their own

690
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,990
people oh yeah we comply with all these

691
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,700
laws and we comply with Wassenaar what

692
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,740
this meant is they had a friend in the

693
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,090
Italian ministry that would okay and

694
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,210
export to Sudan and there wasn't our

695
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,439
right so point is you may work in an

696
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,270
organization where your own management

697
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,010
will not tell you

698
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,379
the truth or will actively mislead you

699
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,910
about what's happening there's also the

700
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,730
con that the international legal

701
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,040
protections are unclear in the long run

702
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,020
at least I couldn't talk here

703
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,540
particularly because she did work that

704
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,280
she thought was okay and then politics

705
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,800
changed and they were long-term legal

706
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,450
repercussions for her so that's the

707
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,700
legal protection if you are doing this

708
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,930
work maybe okay now you don't know what

709
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,940
the situation is in ten years and you

710
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,720
may not know which countries will take

711
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,060
offense with your past work on the

712
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,030
defensive vendor side there's good

713
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,970
salaries or let's get salary but a lot

714
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,530
flexibility if you do the are piece

715
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,810
there's fewer ethical miss incentives

716
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,320
which is both good but the downside then

717
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,580
is you're not business critical normally

718
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,240
and you're always a cost center which

719
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,580
means if business turns sour you will be

720
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,590
on the the list of things to cut and

721
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,899
then there's the emotional side that not

722
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,820
everybody loves which is you get to do

723
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,910
bone research and then kill your

724
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:44,060
creations not everybody deals with that

725
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,950
similarly well but all all three of

726
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:50,080
these options have the individual

727
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:52,340
downsides and neither of them is perfect

728
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,189
another reason is that there's a

729
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,310
somewhat limited societal value add and

730
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,450
the sense that to some extent the

731
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,240
internet Giants have turned themselves

732
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,620
into spy agencies I mean the explicit

733
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,240
reason the Chinese government mentioned

734
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,010
for attacking Google back in 2009 was

735
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,110
Google is turning itself into the

736
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,629
biggest spy agency and you can cooperate

737
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:15,649
or compromise other spy agencies Google

738
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:17,090
doesn't cooperate so the vendors have

739
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,620
turned themselves in to spy agencies

740
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,760
they've convinced the population to pay

741
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
for their own surveillance gear which is

742
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,030
also awesome

743
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,280
and now the spy agencies want a piece of

744
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,990
the pie so if you ask yourself the

745
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,389
question how does offensive work

746
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,030
actually improve the world outside of my

747
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,490
own life the answer may not be terribly

748
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,139
good like the potential for having a

749
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,890
positive impact on a million people is

750
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,420
limited I have a diagram here on how

751
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,770
this works we've got the vendors that

752
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,150
spend billions to convince people that

753
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,920
surveillance like carrying surveillance

754
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,570
devices is a great idea you have the

755
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,770
population that is convinced that this

756
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,330
is a good idea buys the surveillance

757
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,399
divide the device and provides the data

758
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,449
to the members

759
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,738
and then you've got the security

760
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,570
apparatus on the right-hand side that

761
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:57,669
either pulls the data out of the vendors

762
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,499
via legal means or post the data right

763
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,379
out of the the devices my offensive

764
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:03,849
means you get to pick whether you work

765
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,228
for the vendor or the security apparatus

766
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:09,099
you don't get to pick to work for the

767
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:10,960
population which is not great another

768
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:13,509
emotional reason why my offensive work

769
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
is difficult is everything is so

770
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:16,989
complicated

771
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,549
meaning the the joy of finding bugs and

772
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,379
exporting them is very pure it gives me

773
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,979
a very very direct pure intellectual

774
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:26,049
reward every decision thereafter you can

775
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:28,779
write a bookshelf of moral philosophy

776
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:30,879
PhD thesis on the implications or 20

777
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,009
gigabytes of Twitter ranting

778
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:35,259
I personally don't enjoy these

779
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:37,419
complications I like the first part but

780
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:41,799
everything thereafter I could really

781
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:43,859
live without another emotional reason

782
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,879
why I find offensive work difficult is

783
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:47,439
there's the saying that it's very

784
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:48,879
difficult to make somebody understand

785
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,979
something if their salary depends are

786
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:53,289
not understanding it which is a short

787
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:55,809
form of saying that if you're

788
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:57,999
economically dependent on something it

789
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:59,799
by its nature skews your perfect your

790
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:02,289
perspective of that something like you

791
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,330
cannot reason very soberly about

792
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:06,309
something that pays your bills and at

793
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,710
some point I wondered to what extent

794
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:11,080
being part of security makes like

795
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,029
distorts my own view and was curious to

796
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,589
how my view would change if I wasn't

797
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:16,169
economically dependent on security

798
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:21,129
anymore

799
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:23,320
right there's an emotional part which is

800
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:25,059
negative which means security is often

801
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,729
offensive security is less accumulative

802
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:29,499
than most other engineering we stopped

803
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:32,259
really working on Binda for almost 10

804
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:35,440
years ago it's still useful now it's

805
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:37,719
very rare for for offensive tools to

806
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,609
have the same lifespan and if you look

807
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,929
back on long offensive career it can

808
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:43,269
look like oh I found this open edge

809
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:45,339
remote and it's gone I found this RDP

810
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,349
remote and it's gone I developed this

811
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:49,418
technique for exporting 2006 KX my work

812
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,559
that's gone so even by technology

813
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:52,239
standards which is reasonably fast

814
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,668
moving offensive technology is

815
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:58,269
particularly ephemeral ephemeral

816
00:30:54,669 --> 00:31:00,009
ephemeral difficult word okay

817
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:02,379
another technical reason why security

818
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:05,200
isn't offensive security isn't great is

819
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:07,539
if you maximize the profitability it's

820
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,190
actually really repetitive because every

821
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,289
new target has a very significant ramped

822
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,610
up cost your first chrome exploit is

823
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,580
much more expensive to build than the

824
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,289
next ten and the customers build and how

825
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,570
are tool chains around a particular

826
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:21,580
technique so that they need swap ability

827
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,129
of parts so when one bug dies they need

828
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,689
a precise replacement for that bud which

829
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,909
kind of limits the the exploration

830
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,100
exploitation side to exploitation

831
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:32,169
meaning you don't get to explore as much

832
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,539
because you need to produce to maximize

833
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:37,330
profit the same thing over and over

834
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:39,190
again so in some sense you maximize your

835
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,510
profits when you also maximize your

836
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:45,070
intellectual stagnation by doing the

837
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:48,970
same thing over and over again the point

838
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:50,320
eight is offensive work often makes you

839
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,210
transition to an expert on obsolete

840
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,590
technologies because obsolete

841
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,289
technologies is where the bugs are and

842
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,480
you can argue that there's more people

843
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,850
that have a deep understanding of two of

844
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,139
TrueType font rendering in offensive

845
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:07,059
security than they ever wear in

846
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:08,949
typography by now that particular area

847
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,500
has been read and it's provided 15 years

848
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,630
of remote access it may provide another

849
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,669
10 years or so but eventually fund

850
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,380
rendering will be sandbox sufficiently

851
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:20,950
that that's not the drawer you get into

852
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,570
anymore at which point you are the

853
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,200
world's expert on a technology that's

854
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:27,908
not no longer relevant anyway the the

855
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,010
nature of offensive work is that you

856
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:32,789
target mass-market tech which is always

857
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:37,240
a couple of years behind emerging tech

858
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:39,070
right number nine missing a big

859
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,510
technology transformation computing at

860
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,928
the moment is changing in a way it

861
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,549
hasn't changed in 30 years the the data

862
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:48,010
center size computing is emerging we

863
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,330
have protocol prototypical OSS nobody's

864
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,149
got a clue how to properly architect

865
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,590
them no real debugging exists the end of

866
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:55,199
more restructures the way we build

867
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,480
computers and we think about computing

868
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,799
all that is super exciting but a lot of

869
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,110
the offensive work is hey can you do

870
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:03,700
another Chrome please or can we have

871
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,178
another Safari and app reverse please

872
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,500
but kind of feels like it's not the most

873
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:13,389
exciting area so I'll get like I see a

874
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,340
lot of glum faces I'm at the last of the

875
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:17,350
10 negative reason I gave 10 positive

876
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,500
ones I give 10 negative ones

877
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,209
the last

878
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,660
negative part is what I call the

879
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,680
obituary test now my wife calls me

880
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,390
captain sunshine because I actually

881
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,680
enjoy reading obituaries it's probably

882
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:32,720
my favorite form of literature and I

883
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,640
believe in trying to live your life by

884
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,350
reversing reverse engineering your life

885
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,480
from the obituary you would like to have

886
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,429
so sit down and think what you're a bit

887
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,740
sure we should read and then try to live

888
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:46,430
your life in order to get the obituary

889
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,700
you want and I looked at my my imaginary

890
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:51,740
bitch nari and I was like there's there

891
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,410
needs to be more than than just doing

892
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,850
security and I looked around and one of

893
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,980
my idols gave out of the shot oh the man

894
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,679
they're talking everything everything

895
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,900
important about heaps has a very

896
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,850
successful post security career building

897
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,010
imaging satellites and many other of my

898
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,379
idols had multiple careers so at some

899
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:13,250
point I wondered am i a one-trick pony

900
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:14,540
of sorts and I felt the need to try to

901
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,889
do something else for a while I mean I

902
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,399
can always return to security if all

903
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:22,580
else fails but at the moment staring at

904
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:26,989
my virtual obituary I was like okay this

905
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:28,699
needs needs a change so decision on my

906
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,908
side was I'm gonna do something else for

907
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,489
a while

908
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,290
and what I'm gonna do now is performance

909
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,729
optimization because it turns out you

910
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,219
have a lot of a technical upsides of

911
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,190
offensive work meaning it is full stack

912
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:41,480
and if you do well you like if you're

913
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,639
technically competent you can actually

914
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,240
produce really good results for the

915
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,740
client a lot of super interesting

916
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,100
technical problems there and a lot of

917
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,629
room for creative solutions there's a

918
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,969
few emotional advantages of all of that

919
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:57,470
it's really really nice to not have an

920
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:01,250
ambiguous feeling about the implications

921
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,930
of my work just yet it's also really

922
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,950
nice to not have to answer the question

923
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:08,660
for whom so much and given that security

924
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,700
of an offensive security often has the

925
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,799
has negative externalities for somebody

926
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,960
it's really nice to work on something

927
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,630
that has positive externality in the

928
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,460
sense that if I do well my client serves

929
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,620
money I earn money and we're saving some

930
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,860
co2 because we saved energy consumption

931
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,970
that was wasteful in the first place

932
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,520
another great advantage to no longer

933
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,490
doing security is it gives you super

934
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,970
aura tea and Twitter debates because

935
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,990
whenever you

936
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,459
argue with somebody that's still in

937
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,290
security you can have the smug

938
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,550
superiority of saying well your opinion

939
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,900
is invalid because you still earn your

940
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:45,349
money with security so I very much

941
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:48,109
appreciate that that advantage it's a

942
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:50,599
bit unclear whether economically all of

943
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:54,230
this will pan out it's not clear for me

944
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,900
how I can start taxing society if I

945
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:59,510
figure it out I'll be a happy man

946
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:02,090
so summary of my talk offensive work is

947
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:05,300
absolutely great and offensive work is

948
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:08,060
absolutely terrible and I think we

949
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,980
should all be extremely aware of the

950
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,410
fragility of democracies and personal

951
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,530
rights and the fact that in all

952
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,810
likelihood any country you work in will

953
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,400
have death squads in a hundred year

954
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,710
period at least from what we know so far

955
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,540
and the ethical questions are real and

956
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,920
complicated and have no easy answers and

957
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,220
everybody has to answer them

958
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,650
individually two more messages security

959
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,950
is really a very very tiny shard of a

960
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,390
very very much bigger world and

961
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,580
offensive work is a tiny fragment of a

962
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,830
much bigger interesting computational

963
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:42,080
world and as much as offensive work is

964
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:44,109
fascinating and awesome there's a lot of

965
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,750
stuff outside that's also quite cool

966
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:49,900
anyhow balancing your love for something

967
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:54,410
with you're not law for something is

968
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:58,000
often difficult especially for me I have

969
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,000
no good answers enjoy the calm
