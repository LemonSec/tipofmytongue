00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,940
hello my name is Ben to dig report I am

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,798
currently a hawker pentesters

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,040
bounty hunter and researcher what I want

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,690
to call it I work at Hakka Hakka one as

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,150
a hacker personally i've also co-founded

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,189
a forum where we create content for

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,680
people that are new to the book party

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:28,039
scene and now for over 600 walnut

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,039
abilities I'm 90 plus companies on how

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,140
much more so today I want to talk about

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,840
recon I call it a little things it's an

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:52,260
addition of a talk that I Volusion down

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:55,430
last year so what do I do it mostly is

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,718
for self-improvement I wanted a way to

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:03,120
find Amit I'm passionate about that's

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,290
going to build my career there

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,990
networking with companies I've worked

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,250
with meeting engineers on the other side

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,429
in an adventure getting hired at hacker

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,170
1 and I've also get to work with cool

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,380
hackers like team on the right or on the

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,140
left you guys and I also like the

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,939
competition so my buddy and I we compete

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,250
on a daily basis - and we talk about

25
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,199
each other so every time I let him ask

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,580
me he posts the tweet and then

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,829
eventually on the next day when I pass

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:34,200
in and also who doesn't like to make

29
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,329
extra cash good goin ease if you guys

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,950
aren't familiar with bug bounties you

31
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,539
can sign up on any of the platforms

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,250
there's no contract or there's nothing

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,110
you just sign up

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,970
want to work with you find

35
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,430
vulnerabilities and you step into them

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,500
and even offer cash you get paid through

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,200
our couple Facebook and Google also do

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,510
their own PayPal as well there are other

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,430
platforms but I have a focus on hacker

40
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,410
one mostly because to have the higher

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,310
range payments and also have a lot more

42
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,170
targets and how that can happen

43
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,270
so recon the definition of recon from

44
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,740
the military perspective is figuring out

45
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,740
what's out there that's not controlled

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,940
by your family forces but as a hacker to

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,190
me it's understanding how the

48
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,739
application works what is being used to

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,079
build application finding all the

50
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,780
possible entry points whether that's all

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,940
the IP addresses on their subdomains

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,980
other acquisitions and everything that

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,359
pretty much they own and it's also

54
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,420
finding all those files and folders that

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,890
are left behind by developers and I

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,049
think I agree with this tweak a lot of

57
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,309
us spend a lot of time doing recon just

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,870
because we have a passion for it and

59
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,489
it's also a lot more fun than just

60
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,180
sitting there staying at the scene

61
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,250
application for the whole day so to give

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,660
you guys a little bit of an idea of what

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,390
we're going to talk about this would be

64
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,340
much more open up for an entire talk as

65
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,690
we go through each category I'll

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,180
highlight him we'll talk about it and

67
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,410
keep on moving on you know some point

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,690
we're also going to talk about how we

69
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,150
can do all this automated so you don't

70
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,109
have to be doing manually one by one

71
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,360
everything I put up here it's either on

72
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,980
my Twitter with github so you don't have

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,600
to worry about taking pictures if you

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,798
want to go for it I don't mind you but

75
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,109
if you don't want to focus on the

76
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,820
material there so asset discovery is the

77
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,820
first step of understanding what a

78
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,980
company is all about so for this portion

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,400
of the talk we're born

80
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,750
we find subdomains by brute force and

81
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,790
we're talking about difficut

82
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:34,870
transparency so asset discovery is again

83
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,920
we there's a bunch of tools out there

84
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,190
can do all of them if you'd like

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,980
and you feed it a directory directory

86
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,359
start a text file that has all these

87
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,760
words and keywords and supplements out

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,709
that been created by somebody else you

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,328
get a domain name it finds that and all

90
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,610
those summers that exist and gives you a

91
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,280
list of what did UNIX is if you find

92
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,650
that the open or a staging environment

93
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,910
you go out for that entire subdomain and

94
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,579
you find all the stuffing mines that are

95
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,530
behind it but all that stuff is boring

96
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,810
you can't find everything that's out

97
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,019
there if something has random characters

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,549
in it numbers the company name team name

99
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,230
you're never gonna find that is with

100
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,900
food forcing on this you have the four

101
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,579
million line text file and you do some

102
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,410
really cool stuff with it so I want to

103
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,620
avoid more in the directory the brute

104
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,260
forcing method for supplamine enforcing

105
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,150
to find those subdomains by using such

106
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,710
as an agent expense if you're not

107
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,840
familiar to get transparency there are

108
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,789
ton of databases out there we can pretty

109
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,330
much see every certificates been issued

110
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:34,330
to a company

111
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,320
the first one that I always look at I

112
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,500
enjoy using before they started charging

113
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,909
people for it was census now I get

114
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,099
thousand dollars a month for an API and

115
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,950
I don't feel like donating a thousand

116
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:50,300
dollars for an API key but we look at a

117
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,830
search and it gives you you can find a

118
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,990
ton of good stuff so as I mentioned

119
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,280
earlier you can't find something that's

120
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,870
a snapchat - amen - gateway with boot

121
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,250
forcing because there's no way you have

122
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:07,340
the word snapchat your word list

123
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,840
- now next so this is one day

124
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,599
certificate transparency becomes a

125
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,280
little bit easier to do it takes the

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,320
best time to go through the databases

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,750
I'm looking for rather than building a

128
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,580
tool that does all that for you

129
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,470
the other one is sure then if you're a

130
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,150
student you can get a new brush or

131
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,760
family I totally missed as a college

132
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,919
student I wish I knew but if you don't

133
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,320
have their colors you know any college

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,150
can buy one for 40 bucks and it's

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,670
probably one of the best investments you

136
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,229
can do as a hacker this for me I was one

137
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,420
of the best investments the good thing

138
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:44,720
about sure lenio you can pretty much go

139
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:46,970
through all the certificates you can do

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,600
my port number of hosts an organization

141
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,700
you can combine all of those results

142
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,960
which we'll talk about examples at the

143
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,260
end of this as well

144
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,450
search border is a very very good tool

145
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,800
pretty much the same thing I use source

146
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,950
quoted a lot just because of the fact

147
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,950
that it's a really cool API if you go to

148
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:09,169
your website itself it gives you this

149
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,330
blob of JSON but if you clean it up with

150
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,620
a little bit of one-liners with JQ which

151
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,419
Walsh is gonna show you guys in a little

152
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,490
bit as well you can get it pretty good

153
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:21,799
list given to you right and the other

154
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,470
one alternative I also combine them both

155
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,570
its certain SH the good thing about that

156
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,669
is you can use a wallet card so you can

157
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,200
put that before after and as you can see

158
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:34,070
it's finding anything that the key word

159
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,330
you were looking for all those combat

160
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,690
training diamond so there's definitely

161
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,909
that you can do search for doesn't serve

162
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,560
part it doesn't match we support the

163
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,000
wall part which makes a little bit

164
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,039
difficult to find are they're doing

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,129
so you think certainly the stage has

166
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:57,818
been very pop you also have a really

167
00:06:51,129 --> 00:07:00,250
cool API and the next one is using open

168
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,789
source intelligence so this is where the

169
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,289
source

170
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:04,509
transparency stuff kind of falls into

171
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,128
the same category but because of the

172
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,270
sake of just looking for stuff domains I

173
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:10,150
want three categories there with the

174
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,250
supplamine finest the other two things

175
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:16,659
to look for are IP addresses you can go

176
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,280
to Aaron there we go for most big

177
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,490
companies like Google Yahoo Facebook

178
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,440
they have other acquisitions automatic

179
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,240
pulled into their scope within six

180
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,340
months of being acquired such a hacker

181
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,469
knowing that what company was acquired

182
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,460
by them is really powerful so you can go

183
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:35,469
to conch base we put in the company name

184
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm looking for all the four companies

185
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:39,639
you can see a list of all their assets

186
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,409
are in scope Tibet alone gives you

187
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,060
another list of domains that you could

188
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:46,810
do the last steps to is buy all of those

189
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,550
subdomains yeah they gonna tackle okay

190
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,349
well so I go on Aaron so you can

191
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,539
actually look up a company and look at

192
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,759
all the iPads that they own so for this

193
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,979
one we go to Aaron type in Yahoo I

194
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,919
brings up this chart you click on the

195
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,139
organization and you go to the related

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,789
networks and it gives you a list of IP

197
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,469
addresses that your mom nmap and then

198
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,770
all the other content discovery

199
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:11,440
we'll talk about next also show then is

200
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,940
the thing you just go Yahoo and it give

201
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,020
you a bunch of them but it comes down to

202
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,580
what you trying to accomplish and how

203
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,560
passing it out so content discovery is

204
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,000
where all the fun begins so you have all

205
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,759
these IP addresses all these

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,120
acquisitions all their stuff domains

207
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,310
what do you do next until you start

208
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,840
looking at you want to for me instead of

209
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,849
having a first

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,770
at one point I want to be able to just

211
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,839
see what is this I posted the first

212
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,490
thing I do is grab the screen shot then

213
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,500
do a little port scanning I don't do all

214
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,750
the port numbers or select port numbers

215
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,110
that I think are comments I think about

216
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:50,400
20 30 then I do a directory brute force

217
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,740
and then I get to JavaScript

218
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,620
so again ports can't screenshot the

219
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:05,020
crawl these different files these are

220
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:07,480
the list of common shop for all the

221
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:11,220
switches that I take and then using any

222
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,760
of the tools on the right hand side to

223
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,410
research and we'll talk about that next

224
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,460
also check out the robots.txt there's

225
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,990
been plenty of times when I'm looking

226
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,240
for an admin folder and it's always just

227
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,910
things that were lost at txt don't know

228
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,130
why you're gonna give me a admin panel

229
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:33,459
that's really really nervous but always

230
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,930
check that out at always Hoss also

231
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,209
always keep your archive for all you're

232
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,410
doing for your brute force to the good

233
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,119
part the best part about directory

234
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,730
search is that every time you run this

235
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,850
tool it could say a reporter call the

236
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,730
father Tom and it's reports directory we

237
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,010
can do next is find a JMX console or

238
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,020
JBoss that's one one one one in

239
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,910
subdomain and you have done hundreds

240
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,380
elements for us already

241
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,850
you can do it grep through all your

242
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,480
results and see how many of them are

243
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,850
vulnerable so you can see how 72 of them

244
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,200
some of those are false positives you

245
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,000
also see that I have nine that gave me

246
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,450
401 Sammy's every possible particular

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,520
folder which is that there is some sort

248
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,380
of a login method by us and I want to

249
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,650
say like half of the times that I've

250
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,650
tried

251
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,920
not now you will see there's automation

252
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,390
so all these cool banners all work but

253
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,699
if you're going against a company like

254
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:33,850
yahoo and they have 40 48 positions and

255
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,589
4000 supplements on Jesse our comm

256
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,630
running directly brute force on every

257
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,709
single one of those one by one it's a

258
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,930
little under point in this little border

259
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,640
so we'll start with one step at a time

260
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,099
so the first thing I want to look for is

261
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
all the AWS instances I think we have

262
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,700
been sick and tired of hearing that

263
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,959
every big company or government branch

264
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,540
has been breached because they had a

265
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,729
misconfigured mystery bucket so why not

266
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,579
look for those you can do that by doing

267
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,110
Google or going on github which I might

268
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,839
go to you're going you can find a lot

269
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,820
more sources and get hub is who doesn't

270
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,670
commit their codes to get out right so

271
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,170
the other two that I need you to look at

272
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:16,939
so that's what it looks like for github

273
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:24,290
on the Left 14,000 results some of those

274
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:33,560
may not think on the right side are just

275
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:35,899
doing an s3 bucket Amazon there's also

276
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,099
tools so this one is called lazy s3 this

277
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,430
is actually written by me and a friend

278
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,079
leaning over admah what it does is give

279
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,660
it a company name for this one I put in

280
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,699
tests and we have given it a lot of

281
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,890
different environments and permutations

282
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,670
what it looks for like test keyword

283
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,069
input

284
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:57,729
we see it when it's put in test - up in

285
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:04,570
that staging test - admin down put prod

286
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:06,190
and then they put tests it was all those

287
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,290
different permutations in the

288
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,900
developmental stages so you want to make

289
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,640
sure we look we covered every single

290
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,980
possible path

291
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,810
there's also another tool called s3

292
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,060
bucketeer this is also ran by a friend

293
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,510
of mine named Tom dev that's the exact

294
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,660
same thing

295
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,160
this was his idea he did an impasse but

296
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,990
he was locking a lot of different

297
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,030
patterns so we did an investor II and we

298
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,950
did it in Ruby and we give him the same

299
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,579
exact pattern so we have both of those

300
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,170
working I use both I usually use the one

301
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,940
on the right more even though I wrote

302
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,650
the one on the left and that's mostly

303
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,300
because if I don't have Ruby installed

304
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,829
somewhere matches the easiest one to do

305
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,599
both of these require to have a AWS

306
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:48,460
configuration file server box but once

307
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,830
you set that up and give it your AWS s3

308
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:55,870
keys in your own configuration it uses

309
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:57,670
that to look for all these different so

310
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,710
we talked about s3 I mean we talk about

311
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,650
search pottery and we didn't talk about

312
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,290
how we can automate it so majority of

313
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,990
everything that I do is ran in batch and

314
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,880
that's because I'm using different tools

315
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,010
in different languages and the easiest

316
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,290
way to run them all with a ruby rust

317
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:20,110
python go batch becomes a lot easier

318
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,920
it's a little bit messy but it gets the

319
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,680
job done

320
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,329
so the first thing is you want to pull

321
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,829
data from search bar so the first thing

322
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:32,080
I do is I pull all the domains that are

323
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,510
given by search Potter I go for the end

324
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,020
this thing I'm a JQ I clean up the data

325
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,750
given to me and I

326
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,709
just to make sure it's not getting me

327
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,010
certificates that want another company

328
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:44,869
and I've been out data into a folder for

329
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,060
the company name into the company dot

330
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,779
txt file so all those dollar one signs

331
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,430
are the user so you want you ain't

332
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,910
directory your brute force same thing

333
00:13:52,430 --> 00:14:08,120
okay we create an alias you tell it to

334
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:11,240
read the file that you wrote the lines

335
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,520
in your text boundary then you want the

336
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,200
screenshot the same thing I'm just using

337
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,149
exactly the syntax that's given to the

338
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,670
readme file and just dump again an alias

339
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,620
so I don't have to type an entire line

340
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,130
every time I want to go on this tool I

341
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:34,490
just type in a screenshot or search

342
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:36,080
butter and give it my input if you wanna

343
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,910
make it even better you throw it all

344
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,550
into one alias and say hey when I give

345
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,699
you this recon alias all these three

346
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,130
again you just give me the results which

347
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,529
brings me to my next tool called a Xena

348
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,480
con so they say week on does the same

349
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,390
thing in addition to other tools it does

350
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,230
and it grabs the headers for the side

351
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,750
and also the dig host and it generates a

352
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,480
very cool report which I'll show you

353
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:06,529
guys after this one so I suppose I type

354
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,480
in you know NASSCOM lazy Buchanan's calm

355
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,040
because all these different sources and

356
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,060
tools to generate a

357
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,380
means the next step it starts looking at

358
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,989
which ones are reachable and which ones

359
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,360
are not reachable so it's pretty much

360
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,399
when you got your insight that we can

361
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
access with the curl and everything else

362
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,430
that's not accessible and we want to

363
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,440
have those I keep all the logs up every

364
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,060
time I run these scans just to see which

365
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,750
one has gone from our Neutral to each

366
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,849
other later on they can different you

367
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,290
and sometimes there's a lot of them so

368
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,569
this one I wanted a picture they're

369
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,730
taking screenshots but 73,000 URLs

370
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:44,160
wasn't fun I really don't want to wait

371
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,959
on that it has to be done but just to

372
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,410
show you guys what it looks like this is

373
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,810
the report gives you the hostname on the

374
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,100
left side show the research on the

375
00:15:51,810 --> 00:16:01,319
right-hand side I take two screenshots

376
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:37,290
one from 443 and one from ad and I

377
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:38,790
realize all those stickers every now the

378
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,170
password and username

379
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,449
you can do it all online because people

380
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,430
are doing it nowadays now they're

381
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,220
probably doing this professionally for a

382
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,540
while so what do you do you want to look

383
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,030
for the credentials why you want to find

384
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:57,030
the easiest entry point without the I

385
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:01,589
tokens surprisingly you can find a lot

386
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:03,480
of thing for different comments so get

387
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,130
them we can't do all these with tools so

388
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,630
this one I think is from truffle hog I

389
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,370
honestly don't use and then these tools

390
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,790
just because of the fact that I'd like

391
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:13,520
to really dumpster-diving thing and

392
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,720
reading every file because sometimes

393
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,160
maybe I don't find a password that

394
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,079
follow I wanted to but there's some

395
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,220
subdomain or an end point that I would

396
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,409
have missed if I didn't open the file

397
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,060
manually and a lot of false positives

398
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,440
who come through what miss tools not

399
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,730
that they're not great but it's just a

400
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,680
personal preference for me to go through

401
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,010
there manually on this I want to go at a

402
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,960
bigger scale of Dennett was coming so

403
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,890
there's a lot of different patterns you

404
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,670
can look for so if you're going

405
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,400
github.com

406
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,380
you can first start with company.com and

407
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,940
then give it the keyword depth so if you

408
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,890
want to find more subdomain do I find

409
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,210
the credentials either developer is the

410
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,670
staging site whatever that is

411
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,110
and then you can also use there's a lot

412
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,460
more cues and the one on the right those

413
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,709
are the ones that I see happening a lot

414
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,270
more than anything else the best one

415
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,000
that I found so far was the egg state

416
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,420
Pocky where I got access to a company's

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,850
entire financial account of a belt and

418
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,080
that was because they accidentally

419
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,139
submitted

420
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,480
codebase to github and they're all boys

421
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,830
that they later looking at it like you

422
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:21,539
are spec transaction using their PayPal

423
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:23,158
API people whole thing about so there's

424
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:30,289
another tool out there that a lot of

425
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:30,289
people don't use it's a robot so this

426
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:38,039
fire on the wayback machine and we do

427
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,960
the same thing we go through the wayback

428
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,220
machine together you can give it a

429
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,340
website for this one I'm giving hacker

430
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,159
de Paco one calm and it will give you

431
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,049
all the versions of that site with all

432
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,990
the different dates so I'm desperate to

433
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:54,210
have 2014 highlighted and what it does

434
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,190
is it pulls up the 2014 version of this

435
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,899
site and you can right click and pull up

436
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,090
all the JavaScript files and see all the

437
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:03,389
old endpoints that may or may not have

438
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,590
still been left behind so you could be

439
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:06,779
the new people all the JavaScript files

440
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:10,590
you find interesting new and olden

441
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,990
points and you explore them but why does

442
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,519
a JavaScript file matter I gave it two

443
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,070
end points on the best part but there's

444
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,010
been times when I see cloud and since

445
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,769
said to have their potentials hard-coded

446
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,559
in a JavaScript file and those alone are

447
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:27,240
really valuable because you can just get

448
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,879
access to multiple instances and such

449
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,059
just one and then a lot of more bugs

450
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,010
come out of that eventually by itself so

451
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,090
this thing's up to my next tool which is

452
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,210
called Jay Forrester

453
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:41,158
so what James parser does is you give it

454
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,470
a text file or JavaScript file you can

455
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,570
feed it in a one two under text file or

456
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,750
JavaScript files and you would highlight

457
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,210
all the finds so you don't have to

458
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,600
mainly dig through all

459
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,280
they're not in the nicest format the UJS

460
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,110
Forster gives you all the ones that you

461
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,600
need depending on how many file to give

462
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:04,129
it then you start buzzing the API or

463
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,080
whatever that size the next doctor

464
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:14,110
diving attack use Trello don't be this

465
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:14,110
person and you give it a keyword

466
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,090
organizational everybody in the wall can

467
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,100
see this fellow boards and you can find

468
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,080
some really weird stuff just company did

469
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,879
it completely wrong because they had not

470
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,409
only that I've given me they have to be

471
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,930
password and WordPress password or

472
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,880
hostname all the kids be I've been info

473
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,130
they're also given their daddy account

474
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,780
passport in the pin number so if you do

475
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,800
a lot more with their with any account

476
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,629
that you can do with FTP trouble isn't

477
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,730
the only place there's always different

478
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,730
based insights that you can go to and

479
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:09,380
but the examples are difficut chains

480
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,690
fancy sites there were two instances in

481
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,960
different times that I just put in the

482
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:18,130
hostname and either the court or

483
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,130
rabbitmq and sure enough

484
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,139
and the passwords for the default

485
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,160
credentials actually boarded so it got

486
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,270
me in and out pretty nice the next one

487
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,850
was looking for Jenkins

488
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,040
so most Jenkins and sisters are supposed

489
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,560
to be internally accessible but

490
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,240
sometimes the domain or the host name

491
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,040
may not be x1 directly but if you get an

492
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,160
IP address for it it's an entire

493
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,909
different game for this case I just put

494
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,650
in host name

495
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,210
that's where Jenkins popped up an

496
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,770
instance clicked on it there was no

497
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,900
authentication required at all

498
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:52,530
I clicked around and there was all the

499
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:56,550
building it's three keys and a lot of

500
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:58,830
other information I could have used the

501
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,740
other one is sentences not too long ago

502
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,830
I actually got a Jenkins instance access

503
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,590
to Jenkins instance of snapchat this was

504
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,409
honestly maybe 20 minutes of work I went

505
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,300
to census popped in the corporate domain

506
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,380
which you have to look for I can't tell

507
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,669
you what it is but if you do a little

508
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:22,890
search on hacker 1 you can definitely

509
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:25,320
find it yes this one was when you go to

510
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,770
it it just planted prompting you with

511
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,510
the Google authentication and I just

512
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,270
happened to accidentally click on my

513
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,760
gmail and I actually was happened to log

514
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,240
into it because they forgot to just make

515
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,610
it their organisation alone nobody from

516
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,080
the outside and if you have access to

517
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,990
Jenkins and the Guru scripts is

518
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,220
available there's pretty much GT for you

519
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,930
you can just go in there and run any

520
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,970
squares this one I'm just

521
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,920
testing for RCE but obviously it could

522
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,080
do a lot more like read files pivot or

523
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,430
whatever else want to do but because the

524
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,439
bug bounty and we don't want to piss

525
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,760
snapchat off you don't to piss anybody

526
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,050
off of these bug bounties there's a

527
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,270
point where you stop and this both my

528
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:10,629
stomach just show him that I can

529
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:12,820
actually man discovering end points that

530
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,890
were hidden on in JavaScript files this

531
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,550
is actually one of my favorite ones big

532
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:20,230
shadows of my body is lying so example

533
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,389
using js4 sauce so we found this

534
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,940
javascript file within one of the pages

535
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,490
that was supposed to just send you the

536
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,710
link to download the application when

537
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,290
your phone number and it sends your link

538
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,840
so we found out whether tuned in from

539
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:38,310
Sarris there was airbnb.com stash API

540
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,510
that's v2 and then goes to anyone's

541
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,710
there was some Cooper visit for one of

542
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,430
them you have to have your phone up in

543
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,290
your profile and then the SMS allowed

544
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,410
you to use the API to send yourself a

545
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:52,210
text message but there is a limitation

546
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,070
on SMS we can only use 100 sets of

547
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,170
characters and you can't get a lot of

548
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,870
that out of I website with hundreds of

549
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,590
characters and you also have the

550
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:04,510
limitation of making a handful of

551
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,610
requests per hour so that was kind of

552
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,650
boring but we'll come back to later

553
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,850
there's another one that was the

554
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,900
personification so the push

555
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,580
notifications if you're not familiar

556
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,300
with its those notification if you get

557
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,820
on your phone on your team

558
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,320
we're also doing this one also required

559
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,060
this one also require could have the

560
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,340
Airbnb out installed your phone

561
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,770
verification had to be done and you have

562
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,209
to be logged in the best part about this

563
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,180
was there was no character limitation

564
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,880
because it's a push notification and we

565
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,320
had no authority on our and so we can

566
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,820
send as many requests as we wanted

567
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,820
buzzing this was the easiest thing to do

568
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,560
when you don't have a limit so we

569
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,950
figured out base from the JavaScript

570
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,570
followed we figured out that there is a

571
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,280
request that kind of this one the two

572
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,740
things I borrowed a few more the user ID

573
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,720
in the object ID and if you submit any

574
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,310
Bob template this is what I love on a VM

575
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,380
me it gives you an error and it tells

576
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,929
you exactly what you need it tells you

577
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:02,230
hey I need a template from you and I

578
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:04,330
need to be one of these so we did it -

579
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,060
both we gave it just a whatever is it

580
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,370
something invalid you gave us all the

581
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:14,409
templates that it has so we can pretty

582
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:16,659
much to our own account for so we

583
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,820
decided to do was okay my user ID is

584
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,920
double what happens if I just send

585
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,020
myself a test with the body of the table

586
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,130
being test and the body of it being a

587
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,590
test as well and sure enough my phone so

588
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,640
we figured that we could send arbitrary

589
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,409
notifications but that's kind of boring

590
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,870
I mean yeah I could be fishing

591
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,030
I could send random messages but it's

592
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,909
even better if you can actually deliver

593
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,260
it with user IDs and their object ID and

594
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,750
be able to pull out reservation

595
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,190
information and that's that made it a

596
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,670
little bit more fun when we started

597
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,500
receiving

598
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,140
random notifications on our phone and

599
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,700
getting text messages information that

600
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,700
did not

601
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,320
other economy we're using and it gave us

602
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,720
that information on our secondary

603
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,689
account but this by itself is a nine

604
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,580
thousand dollar bounty it took us a good

605
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,960
six hours to figure it out because we

606
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:10,649
were getting tired of reading javascript

607
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:14,700
files but eventually so let's go back to

608
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,350
the dumpster diving thing one of the

609
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,750
findings that I usually do is most of

610
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,699
these companies aren't by themselves so

611
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,310
example Google my eyes off of it you

612
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,930
want to look for those umbrella company

613
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:34,290
first before you focus on the

614
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:40,800
acquisition for example if I'm doing

615
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:43,770
this before it was out of it I just

616
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,740
combined those two and one of the things

617
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,460
that was submitted about 20 or so days

618
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,530
ago was an ftp password

619
00:26:49,460 --> 00:27:06,000
some really interesting data he gave me

620
00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:08,670
access to the entire server for years so

621
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,610
I finished last year with a big bang and

622
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:15,420
to the next year that was a lot of

623
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,179
drinking there's a lot more than just

624
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,200
FTP for that company right some

625
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,460
companies don't have a lot of

626
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,220
information on there whatever

627
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,110
credentials you find but the key is that

628
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,400
what's the next step for a lot of our

629
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,810
bounty hunters we don't know what that

630
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,910
next step there so we have to trust the

631
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,379
comprehensive under investigation or in

632
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,570
some cases they tell you to go to the

633
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,570
investigation before them so for this

634
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,350
one I've done this in this company

635
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,590
particular

636
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,750
I'm sorry guys are watching but a lot of

637
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,539
time to just put in their company name

638
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,690
site comm FTP look at the recently

639
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:52,379
recently indexed boughs and you find a

640
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,809
lot of really cool stuff so I've gone

641
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,970
anywhere from FTP the PayPal that we

642
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:59,460
talked about I've also found an instance

643
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,530
where it gave me the AWS key and then

644
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,130
they WS instance that they were using

645
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:07,918
was a configuration file for a another

646
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,990
database where you connect it to and you

647
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,130
can just create yourself a user account

648
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,590
for all this types that we were using

649
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,179
that database and it just escalated a

650
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,530
lot more unfortunately for me that

651
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,590
company didn't see a lot of value on

652
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:22,860
that they gave me four 50 by the end of

653
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:25,199
the day that was also for 50 for work

654
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,750
the other one that was great

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,789
can't complain but again it all comes

656
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,559
out the company size and whatnot as it

657
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:34,530
is hoping the other thing but this one

658
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,990
is this was a internal development site

659
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:39,360
but what they missed what does it have

660
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,750
all their employees credentials it was

661
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,559
encrypted but as a malicious actor I

662
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,690
don't care if it's an encrypted

663
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,379
harassment these after days after days

664
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:55,740
to figure out its potential company but

665
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:58,200
yeah there's also all those instances of

666
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:03,480
history I'm just talked about again I

667
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,220
think one of the targets a lot of

668
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:11,400
companies it's not intentional but

669
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:14,360
people forget so this was actually sent

670
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,100
to us an echo 1 Peter your skier who is

671
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,530
one of our really great hackers and he's

672
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,090
also an engineer Shopify now he sent us

673
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,158
this really weird and important it's a

674
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,500
hey so I found this s3 bucket that

675
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:29,520
belongs to you guys and I was pretty

676
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,550
much able to go use the CLI for AWS and

677
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,160
pretty much

678
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:36,850
every file that's on there's a new SS 3

679
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:41,650
I said steel like some tax for the

680
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:43,300
bucket pretty much but it's even worse

681
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,030
when you can write to the bucket you can

682
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,310
do more than just read it right you can

683
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,950
rewrite follows you can fish people or

684
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:55,419
whatever they pose so that was a really

685
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:57,280
fun one and that landed him $25 there's

686
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,370
also times when people create is see

687
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,530
names they pointed through s3 but they

688
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,110
forget to go claim it on their account

689
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:09,300
I mean we see this a law and half of

690
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:11,320
wine so look for those if you see a

691
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,540
supplement comes back it's pointing

692
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,919
through is pointing to AWS instance

693
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,120
always check it out that's why I take

694
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,070
screenshots because if I think I

695
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,260
screenshot the first thing I see is that

696
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,179
you know us error that says no such

697
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,770
bucket then I know I got to go around

698
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,270
and clean this book if anybody else does

699
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:29,110
so that's why there's screenshot

700
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:31,330
everything comes into play so we talked

701
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:34,479
about recall we talked about the digital

702
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,159
dumpster diving and we didn't really

703
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,200
talk about how we can do all of this

704
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:44,440
together for one big change so

705
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:47,230
originally I found this domain target

706
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,720
calm the the first step that we talked

707
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,330
about was asset discovery so I find this

708
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,360
stage a development site it's fake but

709
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,179
kind of the pattern that they had so the

710
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,820
content discovery advanced mode

711
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,850
with your keyword hotforwords and then I

712
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,370
did a github search for that exact

713
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:07,830
internal file and he gave me this clue

714
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,780
on github that's okay we have this

715
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,800
endpoint as an API you can do other

716
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:18,389
stuff with it so I took the API and I

717
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:21,629
typed in the same thing internal the API

718
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:27,240
- internal in point and I found a really

719
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:28,380
cool command that had a internal

720
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,000
authentication so the have an

721
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,680
application that looked for a Heather so

722
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,720
instead of having unit type in your

723
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,700
username password they have a header

724
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,090
that you put in your request and that's

725
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,710
completely bypasses their login and for

726
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,560
me to be an outsider that was extremely

727
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,840
valuable because when I send it these

728
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,790
this was a stinky root command and I got

729
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,290
an okay so that was an indication that

730
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,750
something's fishy is going on and I said

731
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,270
geez people I was like hey I'm having

732
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,520
your end just don't panic it was me but

733
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,500
I'm gonna investigate what this was

734
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,550
which I did more digging and I did a

735
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,410
little bit of I brought all the

736
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,450
JavaScript files on the login page so

737
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,460
you go to login page right click look at

738
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,930
the JavaScript files and sure enough

739
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,060
there was a bunch of other endpoints

740
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,850
that I didn't know about and I started

741
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:19,500
making requests to those internal

742
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:21,090
endpoints and one of the things that we

743
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,800
have to get a long time also we don't

744
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,510
know if we'd force any of them

745
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,570
also there's the fact that the password

746
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,970
expired executions on top of it but in

747
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:32,780
the name my goal was to show the impact

748
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,780
that I could get a bunch more

749
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:42,700
and giving me a almost $5,000 comment

750
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:45,820
which was really fun again yeah that was

751
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,490
a entire talk I I'll be around till

752
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,600
tomorrow please keep in touch I'm gonna

753
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,270
reach out to him in any social media

754
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,699
it's always a mistake I can be judge me

755
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,320
via email

756
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,180
directory see all of the that can

can also get activists in Canada October

764
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,540
again all the tools that I've talked

765
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,490
about the top forward the top that the

766
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:29,680
ones where I mean do research is

767
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:31,840
open-source github a big thing give you

768
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,150
guys the organizers here in Econ for

especially eats s Tyler and ministers

770
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,660
everybody here I think that's worth

771
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,639
listening to be an entire time I wrangle

772
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,770
love about my findings a big thing you

773
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,060
know all the hacker one community

774
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,480
members if you go on Twitter and look

775
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,070
for bug bounty protips and under the

776
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,540
hashtag we're gonna tip you can see a

777
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,610
lot of tips out hackers are sharing the

778
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,520
daily basis a lot of these were driven

779
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:57,840
by muting those big thank you as I have

780
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,840
Tom dead Patrick John

781
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,299
[Applause]

782
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:19,460
so dear lizard recon tools integrate

783
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:24,589
with what was it

784
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:26,210
crunch space for recon I was like so

785
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:27,918
this was the biggest version of it

786
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,389
there's another version coming to have

787
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:40,190
more sources and there's more things

788
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:41,839
like right now it's just super silly

789
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,700
question that last bug bathey was like

790
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,009
five thousand two hundred and thirty

791
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:50,078
eight dollars so definitely cut her and

792
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,079
see conversion no so now moment because

793
00:34:51,849 --> 00:35:22,789
you can invite another researcher to the

794
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:25,069
program so we did I go based on target

795
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,440
so a one program tomorrow with

796
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:29,450
company X and the company says hey

797
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,710
everything the owners in school then I

798
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,960
do all these things that I talked about

799
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,839
one that company there's also times

800
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,430
where I create a list of sites so I my

801
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,109
tool that I have I feel it to another

802
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:45,589
bachelor that says hey are you talking

803
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:49,400
about this list run this tool and target

804
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:55,720
to see what so how the companies that I

805
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,720
go to every month or so when you come

806
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,539
[Music]

807
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,800
so if I get the chance to get into

808
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,480
someone's Network for example then I

809
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,920
stop there if I get in a society that

810
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,720
allows would you be in their corporate

811
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,250
VPN I stopped asking some companies tell

812
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,810
me yeah go ahead want to see how far you

813
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,980
can go with this some companies

814
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:37,480
something no no no please don't touch

815
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,650
anything at all because we don't and it

816
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,440
all comes down to your relationship with

817
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,110
that Congress company with a decent

818
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,250
black almost every month then there's

819
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:52,990
that trust that they know I'm not a

820
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:55,540
malicious I'm just trying to I saw in

821
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:58,000
the common github searches for keys I

822
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,610
didn't notice a removed keep couldn't

823
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,950
you put in like I removed key search and

824
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,750
then it finds that Wayback Machine it

825
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,100
and see if it's there so forget me can

826
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,380
actually look at the commitment history

827
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,380
right yeah so if it's still there enjoy

828
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:29,140
you like just because I seem like some

829
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:32,840
people start with something like so I

830
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:37,520
actually do

831
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,200
just because that invites hackers and

832
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,880
submitting a vulnerability on that side

833
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,899
whether it is successful your still

834
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,430
which is going to a bug on your platform

835
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,590
looking at the companies that are

836
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,589
offering a bug bounty program there is

837
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,859
just gonna pick your target so the one

838
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,240
that I recommend to a lot of people

839
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,190
would ask me how they get started

840
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,319
the brother fits the really good takes a

841
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,150
start now the ground your program thing

842
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,250
but everybody in the time they don't pay

843
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:15,500
for anything but to have some websites

844
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:17,570
from the early 2000 there's plenty of

845
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,040
companies if you want to get paid

846
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,560
there's Yahoo that guy was going on for

847
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,060
four years so you might get it might be

848
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,500
harder to find vulnerabilities on there

849
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:29,029
because pain right but in the day it

850
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,890
just comes out to your investment for me

851
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,140
took about six to eight months

852
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,790
when I first other four years ago but it

853
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,319
wasn't for the cash market and we just

854
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,779
said I was going to college not man what

855
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,490
I want to do and I didn't want a college

856
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,440
degree but now we're just going to I

857
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,640
went from business computer science and

858
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,979
business and then I gotcha

859
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,799
but it was mostly to figure out what I

860
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:52,479
wanted to go to my computer so bug

861
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:55,179
bounties were video paying you for years

862
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:56,499
ago and I like the idea of hacking so I

863
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,789
got involved with that community but

864
00:38:56,499 --> 00:39:12,718
there's a ton of hackers every month

865
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:16,029
that come out skills of your time in

866
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:18,880
percentage of time or what you're doing

867
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:21,880
are you doing more recon after the

868
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,469
hacking or the balance or so I go

869
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,939
between three things one is recon the

870
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:30,660
second one is developing my tool when I

871
00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:32,890
get tired of hacking the third one is

872
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,288
ripping up an actual college in the park

873
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,269
so I talked about the Airbnb stuff even

874
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:40,900
though Airbnb had a lot of things in

875
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:42,609
scope all the websites go I focus on the

876
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,679
main app itself because it was so huge

877
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:49,019
dependents were great and there was a

878
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:49,019
lot of so I spent

879
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,680
it was that's when I started learning a

880
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,030
lot nobody was looking at baby in me

881
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,830
because he looks now but if you actually

882
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,150
sign up and go through everything it's a

883
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,470
huge application and that was when I

884
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:16,210
learned a lot of this stuff that I

885
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:18,730
learned a lot of the tricks because have

886
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,380
you done any formal planetary

887
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,900
penetration testing and like written a

888
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:26,080
reports for that and where I'm going

889
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,730
with this is do you have any opinion on

890
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:40,840
whether report for like that formal

891
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:42,900
contact for this so it's an entire thing

892
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,900
right

893
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,030
[Music]

894
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,860
the versus bug bounties I have the

895
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:08,410
freedom of looking at this from anywhere

896
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:12,100
in the world anytime your boss or

897
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:15,339
anybody myself and I did this for my

898
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,980
entire glossary of college and I made a

899
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:20,230
six digit salary just by doing work now

900
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,160
is because I

901
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,330
and that's the biggest thing to the

902
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,350
power stand you have to buzzer all

903
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:30,220
methodology before you become so the

904
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:34,630
methodology helps you out win some /

905
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:36,640
some large percentage of your targets

906
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,170
don't work out right well the

907
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,940
methodology I talked about this one with

908
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,260
just my recon knowledge right there

909
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,820
but if it's a site that's just an

910
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,170
application - what about this different

911
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:50,280
game well you start you focus on one web

912
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:52,630
example scripting that's all I focus on

913
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,060
the next thing is you want to find

914
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,590
ss-sorry you find it depends on the

915
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,450
application what is it doing how does it

916
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,850
process that data what kind of data is a

917
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:02,200
process if it's an image busting site

918
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,880
and there's definitely more holes you

919
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:16,240
can do it there's different photos you

920
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:16,660
can do that look at because the xs/s

921
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,399
board

922
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,990
what does I see another sign that's ok I

923
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,240
mean you're a lot of good user important

924
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:24,569
you sign things are going to put other

925
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,569
things

926
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:02,109
yeah but if if you need course material

927
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,930
to learn and we also have what they call

928
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,098
hot girl one-on-one numbers 1 0 1 so

929
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,868
it's pretty much what we call her hack

930
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,490
of Education site it walks you through

931
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:11,740
all these different woman pollute ibises

932
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,359
labs for that YouTube videos for it if

933
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,520
you don't have access to a 71 hack lock

934
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,880
we give you all the labs and you created

935
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,859
on different scenarios but at the end of

936
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,290
the day it's you whatever time you put

937
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:24,700
in for yourself is six to eight months

938
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,490
and I did I felt my entire upper

939
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:33,129
division courses because I was going

940
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:34,299
litter to my class then I realized I

941
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:40,210
just want to get out of school because

942
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:44,220
it was getting so I just get out of the

943
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,220
way but I was spending I want to say

944
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:51,359
thanks for not school because I wanted

945
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,359
to be in

946
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,230
yeah so I think at least when I look at

947
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,540
some of these joint companies and I read

948
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,820
their requirements and they're like you

949
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,860
know test us but don't be checked

950
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,710
anything you know how can you do that

951
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,300
well depends on how you do it for

952
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,740
example a find a sequel injection you

953
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,230
don't have to pull their credentials you

954
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:16,310
can just give it a sneak where they can

955
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:17,810
sleep for five seconds concept if you're

956
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,549
going to get any more communication you

957
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,410
have to meet the NC passport father it's

958
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,690
a shadow file you can read it a random

959
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,700
process power host

960
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:29,450
that's what they mean don't don't take

961
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:31,220
it too far as with newer hackers they

962
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,230
don't want you to cause downtime right

963
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,060
so whatever safest path that is for you

964
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,730
to show there's a vulnerability should

965
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,590
be the one that you go through so again

966
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,510
for the injection ones I tried to do

967
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,230
something like curl my which I can see

968
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,230
the logs for it

969
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:38,520
I say hey there's the because yes
