1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,548
I'm Steve Thomas I'm going to give a

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,189
little talk here should run give it take

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,840
30 35 minutes

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:13,200
about are you a hacker and what makes

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,990
you the hacker welcome with Tyler Tyler

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,240
says please do come up with something so

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,698
I did and there's going to be a little

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,880
bit of humor into this there's going to

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,070
be a little bit of craziness if you want

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,698
to pull with that a little bit of some

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,560
stories also the bottom line is if you

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,170
don't have a sense of humor in IT

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:43,019
security or cybersecurity the doors

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:44,370
there there we go and it's about that

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,289
you're going to be subjected to a little

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,419
bit of Rovio there satire frolic through

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,950
your thoughts observation about a

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,140
subject that's really near and dear to

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,850
every but that everyone within the same

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,510
security industry as I mentioned so

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,510
you've been warned

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,800
Tyler's not here to enjoy this this is

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,180
an inside joke between Tyler and me

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,090
basically welcome to how not the hack of

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:11,310
bathroom 101 last year at any con here

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,549
he has to be throw together a five

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,080
minute dissertation and when that

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,770
happened one of the bathrooms upstairs

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,869
broke so I said we could purse something

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,000
together based upon you know half a

31
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,030
bathroom from the three stooges

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,290
perspective and he said dude that would

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,659
be awesome I said I don't know at the

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,049
time I'm not sure who's going to get

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,650
that those jokes anyway but again it's

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,200
an inside joke between Tyler and I we

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,280
have a little bit of a disclaimer

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,770
basically if you could read the first

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,259
line and that is warranty on for the

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,530
stalkers void upon was actually Boyd

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,369
yesterday so we'll move on from there

42
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:57,509
and that is if anybody has ever seen

43
00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,079
these words this is actually from the

44
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,939
hacker manifesto and it continues on

45
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,479
then I guess I'm a criminal my crime is

46
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,579
out of curiosity

47
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,440
my crime is that about smarting you

48
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:14,319
something that you will never forgive

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:18,819
before the hacker manifesto by the

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:24,040
mentor I don't know if anybody's

51
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:26,619
familiar with the terms hacker or where

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,069
that she came from that actually began

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,450
in the 1960s out of MIT you had a really

54
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,000
you've got a bunch of people that were

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,319
really really smart at programming in

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,280
Fortran some older 2g 3G languages more

57
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,018
so teaching and they were calling them

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,660
nerds that will call them all kinds of

59
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,849
different names and basically what stuck

60
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,540
was they were hacking away on problems

61
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:56,109
so they became known as hackers those

62
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,739
are the true hackers Wikipedia everybody

63
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,810
loves Wikipedia states that reflecting

64
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,970
on the two types of hackers there are

65
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:08,670
two definitions of the word hacker one

66
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,700
inherits the technology and programming

67
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:15,880
subculture someone who is able to

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,700
subvert them confuse security in doing

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:23,230
so for malicious purposes the person can

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,540
also be called a contractor if anybody

71
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:31,569
wants to agree with that or not that's

72
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:35,319
up to you but beyond that couple site

73
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:38,290
notes about a cracker the crackers not a

74
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:42,369
slave owner of the original formation of

75
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,069
the word or an overseer cracking whip

76
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,940
cracker predates the plantation era and

77
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:51,130
it would refers to someone who have been

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,060
too poor to own slaves at that time

79
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:58,569
which bad thing but it happened say to

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,599
say it was farmers who raised only crack

81
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:04,179
products such as wheat and corn cracker

82
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,179
was a derogatory term back then applied

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,340
to warfare

84
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:13,349
before the American Revolution and it's

85
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:16,350
definitely not a saltine crackers in

86
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,079
computer terms a cracker is a security

87
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,190
hacker a person to maliciously exploit

88
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,320
weaknesses in a computer or network a

89
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,960
cracker is also a person who uses

90
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,900
password cracking techniques to recover

91
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,599
passwords steal passwords the cracker

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,609
could also be somebody who takes a piece

93
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:39,180
of software and breaks that modifies it

94
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:43,849
for their own malicious intent and/or to

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,160
run it without having what relationshipy

96
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:50,759
what about I wonder what about of a

97
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,599
safecracker doesn't that align with

98
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,910
lock-picking

99
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:57,090
is it lock-picking part of physical

100
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,550
hacking and if you go out to DEFCON lock

101
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:03,030
picking 101 is a big thing out of there

102
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,889
I know that if you go upstairs to see

103
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,559
Bruce and the hardware hacking village

104
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,000
he's got a bunch of log set up so if you

105
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,550
want to go over if you've got a lot

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,070
picking set I think they have one or two

107
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,199
there to go try and prove your skills

108
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,330
[Music]

109
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,409
onward from there and I turn around I

110
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,469
say a little about code hacking but

111
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:31,469
anyway if you're out about you mentioned

112
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,650
the term hey I went to DEFCON or you're

113
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,960
at DEFCON and somebody sees you and they

114
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,690
say are you a hacker and you say yeah

115
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,919
well not really but I go to that

116
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,219
immediately the connotation is that

117
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,380
you're a terrible person you're evil

118
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,110
you're not a person I want to hang out

119
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,759
with and they look at you oddly or in

120
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,690
some instances they'll turn around and

121
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,380
cringing you nasty oh god you're a

122
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,909
hacker now I don't want to talk to you

123
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,590
and sometimes they just interpret the

124
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:05,180
word wrong thinking maybe you're a t-rex

125
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,179
and they just want to run away from you

126
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,050
the card-table story I have to put a

127
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,699
little things just rewind

128
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,099
what some of the stories don't want to

129
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,830
put into the I want that at Def Con this

130
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:20,650
year walk across from Caesars into the

131
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,258
Cromwell it was every single day out

132
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,739
there was like a hundred and two to 111

133
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:29,080
every single day it was a hot night wise

134
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,300
it was anywhere from a hundred down to

135
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,599
ninety five degrees and it was hot at

136
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,520
night I walk across the bridge I get

137
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,960
into the Cromwell I got the pages on

138
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,990
being they won't light up and all the

139
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,810
rest and I sat down at a car table and

140
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,490
there were two women sitting there and

141
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,949
when I sat down I won the first four

142
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,949
hands so they one woman over here turns

143
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,020
around and says are you a hacker did you

144
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:57,039
just come across the street to hack the

145
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,419
game I was like my Wellington Def Con

146
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,940
which is a hacker kind of good

147
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,490
conference she turns around she goes oh

148
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,979
my god she Pat's her friend on the side

149
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,340
shut your cellphone's off it's terrible

150
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:12,729
he's being a hack our cellphones like oh

151
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,989
my god you're here to hack the card

152
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:18,008
machine I'm gone

153
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:21,460
oh thank you for saying that in front of

154
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:23,770
the pit boss and the card dealer so the

155
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,080
pit boss comes over security person

156
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,799
walks over a little ways and I'm sitting

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,068
there going I everything electronic has

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,690
a signature you already know that

159
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:38,529
everything electronic theoretically

160
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,719
could be broken by injecting a lot of

161
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,490
another electronic signal towards it or

162
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,650
break it or who knows what you can do

163
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,240
with that it's up to us to figure it all

164
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,190
out

165
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,639
however every single the machines that

166
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,279
are in a casino has been hardened on

167
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,590
separate networks or are not connected

168
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,620
to anything especially the shuffle

169
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,109
machine so security one works Romania

170
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:07,409
walks away the dead boss turns around

171
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:10,360
looks at me and goes yep we have hackers

172
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,129
damn hackers and walks away

173
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,659
she starts at home I said sometimes

174
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,560
you're gonna be careful how you use

175
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:22,060
certain terms in society a hacker is

176
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,800
very bad connotations going from that a

177
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,719
hacker versus a script cutie

178
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,750
anybody familiar with the turn script

179
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:34,299
Kitty cool basically a script kiddie

180
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,260
also known as a script bunny a skinny a

181
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:42,189
script and Kitty it's a term that's used

182
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,410
about an unskilled hacker who relies

183
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,750
heavily on third-party scripts or

184
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,300
programs to wage a cyber war or cyber

185
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,910
attack against a network a system for a

186
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,140
website they're utilizing somebody

187
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,630
else's scripts the sad part is when they

188
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,390
download they may not have any idea how

189
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,579
those scripts work or what problem what

190
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,120
problems will come knocking on at the

191
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:09,910
door or the her door they don't

192
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,490
understand and basically I consider them

193
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,230
and I think most of us will that they're

194
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,410
an entry level potentially malicious

195
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,810
person they're looking to hack they're

196
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:25,089
looking to find out and they're just

197
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:27,609
blindly using software so it's safe to

198
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,160
say and use one of my oldest scenes and

199
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,190
that is a little bit of knowledge can do

200
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,779
a lot of damage that's so true

201
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,890
especially in our slave little world

202
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:41,199
today and yes this is going to talk

203
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,589
about script kiddies it's just I have to

204
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:48,250
throw it out there because everybody's

205
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:50,170
utilizing terms today that sometimes

206
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,079
they don't know the meaning of or they

207
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:58,149
use the word hacker or script Kitty as

208
00:09:53,079 --> 00:10:00,010
being malicious and evil on word does

209
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:03,279
understanding different hacker terms

210
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,019
make you a hacker now there's only a

211
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,050
sample of some of these some of these

212
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,670
are old some of these are no and the

213
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,859
bottom one I'm sure a lot of us know

214
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:17,349
about if you know prom or not but does

215
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,130
any of these terms if you show up at a

216
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,020
hacker con

217
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,880
French and you're throwing around terms

218
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:30,069
that that make you a hacker maybe huh

219
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:32,500
maybe not if you know more than one

220
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:39,310
computer language whether they're old

221
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:41,410
languages newer languages and when I put

222
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,619
the sink together I think there's upon

223
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,839
Wikipedia I think I use there was well

224
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,490
over 150 different computer languages

225
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,240
which is scary

226
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,770
and it goes on from there that you build

227
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,750
them all out of there's a lot of them

228
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:02,130
last one and the last column is binary

229
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:09,010
anybody programming by an area any more

230
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:11,770
recently I threw that into it is my

231
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:17,670
computer ethics teacher or my business

232
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:19,930
ethics teacher in college was an ex

233
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,860
manager if you want to call it that at

234
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:26,290
IBM he was one of the field engineers

235
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,880
and worked his way up working on

236
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,589
different idea of mainframes back then

237
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,590
he asked anybody in the class just for

238
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,600
grins and giggles does anybody know how

239
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,970
to boot one of the original IBM

240
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,020
mainframes so I said yeah you turn the

241
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,340
power on at boots you know it does start

242
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,930
the boot but you got to go over to a

243
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,090
little console and type in ones and

244
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,170
zeros and if you don't get the pattern

245
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,670
right you've got to start all over from

246
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,150
scratch shut everything down wait a

247
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,160
minute

248
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,949
let's turn it back then I continued on

249
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,350
and I was like you gotta be joking Mises

250
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,900
yeah these are we program it oh yeah

251
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,900
just to get the Machine of it like what

252
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,110
if you own or we're hacker themed

253
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,960
t-shirts does that make you a hacker

254
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,660
whether it's some of the newer ones a

255
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,870
little story behind that one the second

256
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:24,250
one that was made up to actually say

257
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,650
that a hacker hacked Calvin Klein which

258
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,410
well it's true and I couldn't find any

259
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:32,920
stories about but it's a nice background

260
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,410
story different types of things I don't

261
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,599
know if you could read that one the last

262
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,240
one over there make me a sandwich you're

263
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,629
black make it yourself sudo make me a

264
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,680
sandwich okay now if anybody's familiar

265
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,300
with Lennox or scripting once you sign

266
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,649
on to Alec's box you should be using

267
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,839
sudo to advance yourself permission wise

268
00:12:53,649 --> 00:13:00,339
to root level so that you can run things

269
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:05,529
of your level I like that one seat seedy

270
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:07,589
pub more beer and a couple other

271
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,850
different ones

272
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,800
you're going to see or you may have seen

273
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,060
some people walking around any kind of

274
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,819
here with some good t-shirts

275
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:21,000
I love the Atari one man that's old

276
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:22,899
school I love it but that's what it is

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,079
you're going to see people walking

278
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,389
around with different types of shirts on

279
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,699
doesn't make it on the hacker no but

280
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:33,790
they understand sometimes what the hack

281
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:38,109
of philosophies are and they like to

282
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:43,240
show it off I mean look at me it says

283
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:46,540
1939 Tyler asked me to smaller wolfies

284
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,250
what's the 1939 and I says it's HP where

285
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:54,310
they actually started from out of their

286
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:57,310
garage in 1939 he goes cool I know that

287
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,040
he said I'm glad to see that we're

288
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,290
getting a huge influx and woman with in

289
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,480
computer with its cybersecurity it's

290
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,649
long overdue

291
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,509
they've been programmers in the

292
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,680
background for many many years and it's

293
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,939
about time they got out of the

294
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,949
background and a big person to help

295
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,910
anybody whether it's female or male get

296
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:22,180
out of the background

297
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:25,600
come on front from there we'll go off

298
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,309
into an interesting fact interlude does

299
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,850
anybody know where the term spam

300
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:37,540
actually originated from you didn't even

301
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,579
get a chance to see me do this Monty

302
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,769
Python careers

303
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:43,920
back in the seventies about spam the

304
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,369
Hormel spam the cans spam poking fun out

305
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,679
of it

306
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:50,279
because the term in that skit was used

307
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,230
so many times it was annoying so when

308
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,540
the idea of all this junk mail

309
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,540
originally started hitting the internet

310
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,488
and everybody was email accounts

311
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,480
everybody started using the term spam

312
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:08,279
and there's no sound otherwise you would

313
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:12,720
hear the spam Salone better supply

314
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:15,449
t-shirts you've got when you go out to

315
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,589
blackhat not so much with Def Con Def

316
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:21,359
Con you got to buy your trip t-shirts

317
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:24,179
but black hat if you go through the

318
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,980
vendor village or the business where

319
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:29,459
they called business village I think

320
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,259
it's called that is we're constantly

321
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,649
giving out all kinds of swag whether

322
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:38,519
it's t-shirts whether it's all kind of

323
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:41,519
swag spinners lashes spinners believe it

324
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,829
and you get so many different people a

325
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,279
couple years ago we had Nike out there

326
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,329
Nike security they had a nice party it

327
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,360
was great and they were handing out

328
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:53,819
t-shirts at it some of the other one

329
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,209
that was one of my favorites actually

330
00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:00,089
and yes these are my t-shirts there's

331
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:01,738
Raytheon security it's great they come

332
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:07,189
up with some really interesting

333
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:10,169
Callie Lennox Kelly revealed t-shirts

334
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:12,629
Metasploit this year celebrating 25

335
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,879
years I think it is so they had a

336
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:17,759
they're calling it the best way to wear

337
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,410
t-shirt and you can buy one and they

338
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,919
give out stickers for don't like that's

339
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:25,529
really cool I got myself one so I did

340
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:29,399
but there's any wearing of these make

341
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:33,059
you a hacker of course not they're great

342
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:36,829
they're great looking however last year

343
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:40,679
were spinners of blackhat this year

344
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:42,660
believe it or not we're socks they're

345
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:47,539
giving away socks

346
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,829
and yes I'm glad to say that I got some

347
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,480
they're cute they're comfortable they're

348
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:54,290
free

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,889
but seriously think about it for a

350
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:01,040
minute if you get a vendor's t-shirt or

351
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:03,669
socks does that doesn't make you a

352
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,619
hacker doesn't make you security aware

353
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:08,539
it makes you a free billboard for that

354
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,989
for their product as you walk around

355
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:20,480
advertising who they are guess what they

356
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:21,859
just hacked you big thing at the

357
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,380
different conferences of course is

358
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,208
drinking those going to some of these

359
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,779
parties and drinking had any other kind

360
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:33,799
qualify you it was a hacker look screwed

361
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:35,480
up that that's like and the thing was

362
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,980
with this is and I'm looking at it going

363
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,029
you know what when you go out to these

364
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:44,049
cons they don't have that amount of

365
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:47,179
drinks it's more something like that

366
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:49,580
because the hackers still even the goons

367
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:52,070
if they want to try to social engineer

368
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,019
them they'll turn around and say nicely

369
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,580
get me a bottle of booze get me one of

370
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,809
these so if you carry around some of the

371
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,460
little flight bottles

372
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,610
it's amazing what you might get in

373
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,610
return

374
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:07,399
social engineering well they considered

375
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,899
the hacker well they use the art of

376
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,850
deceptions in that manipulate

377
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:14,000
individuals into divulging confidential

378
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:18,289
personal information that may be used

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,769
for fraudulent reasons malicious hackers

380
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,260
use that for as different types tactics

381
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:26,360
because it's easier to exploit a user's

382
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:31,010
weakness than it is a network or a

383
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:33,110
system so any corporation any business

384
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,200
that you're in should have some sort of

385
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,709
cyber security training that also

386
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,970
includes the spearfishing things for

387
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:48,110
emails your spam but on top of that they

388
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,909
should also include don't talk about the

389
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,799
business don't talk about certain things

390
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,690
don't they bulge things even if you have

391
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,429
a drink or two because you never know

392
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,799
who you're going to be talking to and

393
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:01,609
they're trying to social engineer you to

394
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,658
get more information there's a couple

395
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:08,299
different types of social engineering

396
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:09,969
attacks one of them is baiting where

397
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:13,539
they use the devices laying around

398
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:16,129
couple years ago at blackhat at Def Con

399
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:18,499
somebody printed up a bunch of cue codes

400
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:20,059
and they put them all over the walls as

401
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:21,859
you're walking in the hallways in the

402
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,379
bathroom what have you there were

403
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,580
different cue codes so people were dumb

404
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:29,269
enough to turn around take their

405
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,218
smartphone on take it a picture of it

406
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:34,849
well guess what they just send their

407
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:37,009
phone stolen because when you go out to

408
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:40,849
blackhat when you go out to black happen

409
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:43,309
or so at Def Con in Las Vegas if you

410
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:47,389
look at the number of cell towers that

411
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:50,418
are out in Vegas around the area of

412
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:53,899
Caesars or wherever Def Con is going to

413
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:57,499
be about a month beforehand you only see

414
00:19:53,899 --> 00:20:01,070
maybe one two or three towers when you

415
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:02,960
go out there during bla Def Con you're

416
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,649
going to see 30 or 40 different towers

417
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,599
bumping on why because they're called

418
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:11,539
rope towers they're out there trying to

419
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:14,029
get you you get your phone or device to

420
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,609
hook up to that their tower to steal

421
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,759
your information to it decrypt an end or

422
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:22,399
to just break your phone another thing

423
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,049
is baiting well that's beside the money

424
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,508
I did that already the other thing that

425
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,759
may be laying around could be a USB

426
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:30,979
stick how many people have actually

427
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:33,649
walked out into a parking lot and so on

428
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:35,690
a USB stick sitting there take it home

429
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,559
plug it in what winds up happening you

430
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:42,379
get your your laptop your home computer

431
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:48,289
infected fishing well I just pass that

432
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:50,149
one fishing can be basically fraudulent

433
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,399
mail to get you to click onto things or

434
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:57,379
to fool you into that this is an

435
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:59,178
official type of email plus we know the

436
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:01,059
world slightly security training we

437
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:06,440
should be clicking on that stuff

438
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:07,790
phishing is a great attack that you get

439
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,730
a phone call from somebody

440
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,139
hi we're from Microsoft and we noticed

441
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,060
that you have an updated your system

442
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,460
could you turn your computer on please

443
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:19,010

444
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:24,920
you get your computer up to speed and be

445
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:30,650
safe and secure and don't do it one of

446
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,970
the best things about that yeah using

447
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,010
any type of social engineering

448
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,260
methodology I think there's like seven

449
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,300
or seven or eight different types of

450
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,060
social engineering but utilizing social

451
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:46,040
engine does that make you a hacker

452
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:51,350
somebody malicious somebody evil quick

453
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:55,700
hoodie story I got last year I was out

454
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:58,100
at blackhat and I was able to get from

455
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,220
one of the vendors oh goody I wanted

456
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,810

457
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,700

461
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,380
more important and more interesting

462
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,780
about it is that it had young wire all

463
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,000
around the edges and lit up in a block

464
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,060
that blinked and did really cool things

465
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,190
when I like I want that so they said

466
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,740

467
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,140

468
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,060

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,160
any what's your size and I thought and

494
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:48,590
he handed it to me my ticket number was

495
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:51,490
389 social engineering works sometimes

496
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,860
evilly but sometimes for good reasons I

497
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,860
texted him a picture of it and he turned

498
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,309
around and said you're a bastard

499
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:04,100
I wanted that well you should tell me

500
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:07,520
what you should be doing so it was that

501
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:12,980
evil of what I did it's a little white

502
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:17,900
lie oh well you're gonna see a lot of

503
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:20,090
people here that have these and that is

504
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,100
when you cover your laptop with stickers

505
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,139
or you get a bunch of the stickers it's

506
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,120
the big thing today or it's one of the

507
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,150
big things that all Commons is giving

508
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,918
away stickers this year at any con they

509
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,440
created the any kind of sticker which is

510
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,870
awesome if you don't have one go see

511
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,549
Tyler go see the front desk grab one or

512
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:41,290
if you got your backpack I believe

513
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:44,980
there's one in there you're going to see

514
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:48,470
quite a lot of different people have

515
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,000
stickers all over their laptops having

516
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,770
your laptop covered in different

517
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,480
stickers that are cited security or

518
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:59,600
cyber or where does that make you a

519
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:04,070
little hacker also excuse me hang on a

520
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,469
second I'll go through the next slide

521
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:11,530
one thinking uh-oh

522
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,530
maybe I should have done that there's

523
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,020
I think it's really really cool I think

524
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,020
it's great to decorate your laptop I

525
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,060
think it's real amazing some of the

526
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,560
stickers and some of the shrink-wrap

527
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,159
that you can get from some of the

528
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,870
laptops to decorate your laptop would I

529
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,790
do then

530
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,550
what am I have the laptops yeah I got it

531

532
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:42,060
so I'm not knocking it but I talked with

533
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,010
somebody at Def Con who was just getting

534
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,659
into cybersecurity but their laptop was

535
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,780
already covered in stickers well how

536
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:51,210
long you been in cybersecurity um I just

537
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,889
started last month I said well did you

538
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,540
get any training no I'm just trying to

539
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:58,520
figure out where I want to go with it

540
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,590
what is it okay are you a hacker no I

541
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,750
want to be one though

542
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:08,490
well thanks more than just stickers on

543
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:11,970
your laptop big thing last year at Def

544
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:15,540
Con was people making up in tin foil

545
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,070
hats now does making a tooth well hat

546
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,409
and understanding why you're we're

547
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,550
making up and wearing it does that make

548
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:32,070
that person a hacker also in a way it

549
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:35,550
does why a they put on I took a picture

550
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,169
live from a person out of Def Con this

551
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,730
year and I said don't worry I'll lure

552
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,400
out your face and do that with all of

553
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:46,320
them the first picture was actually it's

554
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:48,570
I grabbed it off the internet but they

555
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,470
had a whole contest area there at

556
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,840
blackhat there at Def Con where you go

557
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:58,350
over grab the tin foil and start making

558
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,100
up your hats as many as you want and and

559
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,300
whatever design you want and I'll be

560
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,389
honest me that I think it's really

561
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,070
really cool I think it's a great thing I

562
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,670
talked to Tyler maybe we should be doing

563
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:14,730
it here next year the idea of a tinfoil

564
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:17,610
hat is to help your brain not absorb so

565
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:21,660
many radio frequency waves but does that

566
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:23,969
make you a hacker yes because you're

567
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,310
taking tinfoil and putting it into it

568
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:29,070
different format than what it was

569
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,590
originally designed to do you're making

570
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:37,139
something out of it you're hacking that

571
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:39,959
tinfoil a little bit of humor the guy

572
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,370
come up to me couple years ago he says

573
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,340
do you know of any way I can learn

574
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,209
because of how to code in 24 hours or in

575
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,820
a single night

576
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,070
I told them honestly yeah pack up a

577
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,419
laptop travel to the North Pole at the

578
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,270
beginning I went to you'll have six

579
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,810
months of night to learn how to code go

580
00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:01,830
for it scooter and he just looked at me

581
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:07,830
going there's smart ass this is most

582
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:10,199
people in the IT security are happy

583
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,409
sovereign and on the Box it said to

584
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:18,990
install it on Windows 7 or better so I

585
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:23,340
said better sweet slow Linux ok bad

586
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:25,620
jokes I know anybody in this software

587
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,120
industry sometimes it's you're on a

588
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,669
deadline you can't get it through the

589
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,899
compile you can't get it to do what you

590
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,180
wanted to do but when it finally

591
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:38,700
compiles what's the first letter or the

592
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:41,100
managers mouth shipping it's ready if

593
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,770
you give somebody a program you will

594
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,870
frustrate them for a day if you teach

595
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,240
them how to program you'll frustrate

596
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:52,139
them for a lifetime I think that's a

597
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,750
very apropos type of comment or a

598
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,360
comment for anybody in the security

599
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:01,080
industry because they're swamped we're

600
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,330
out there that we could write and yeah

601
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:07,080
it can frustrate us quite a lot to

602
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:10,649
trying to get that rate coding to get it

603
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,810
to do what we're looking for it to do I

604
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,880
love this little saying the truth is out

605
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,879
there does anybody have the URL for it I

606
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,140
love this one too

607
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:27,840
computer beat me at chess but it was no

608
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,710
match for the kickboxing so on from

609
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,770
there

610
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,120
the hack the term hacker in today's

611
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,250
society

612
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,060
the media is overtaking us a steam term

613
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:42,520
to meet something malicious evil always

614
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,470
breaking in without authorization to

615
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,389
steal information drain bank account

616
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:50,200
steal private clothes from your phone

617
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,550
your home computers steal your drone do

618
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,100
anything that they want to do to

619
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:57,610
overcome security break into your social

620
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:00,250
media accounts and or your home your

621
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:03,820
home if you have a smart home be very

622
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:09,180
careful because yes you can break into a

623
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:12,730
lot of these smart homes but the media

624
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,500
backup the second thing but the hack of

625
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,830
society calls of criminals their

626
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,990
attackers the malicious end or possibly

627
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,090
state-sponsored against another state

628
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,940
and I'm not talking New York State

629
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:28,290
against California or California against

630
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:32,770
the United States I'm saying a

631
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:37,629
state-sponsored terrorism and or hacking

632
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:42,520
group hacking from China to another

633
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:46,840
country so the country to country why is

634
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:49,060
the media so demonized this term and now

635
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,510
we're almost afraid to use it in

636
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:55,200
everyday life why does the media always

637
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:58,270
get things correct when they're doing

638
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,580
articles or media presentations

639
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,520
you know they look for the shortest

640
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:08,080
possible route to get the biggest bang

641
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,780
for the buck and that is a hacker broken

642
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,649
the hackers are evil the hackers are

643
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:19,720
mean they're cruel people not or not no

644
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:23,170
they're not let's look like this from

645
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,620
CSO magazine again hacker term in a

646
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:30,100
society cyber criminals use malware and

647
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:35,469
exploit to steal money motivation for

648
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:37,659
big financial gain stammers yeah okay no

649
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,970
I'm going and I'm looking at the term

650
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:44,529
hacker as a malicious person

651
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:46,539
not a good person spammers an adware

652
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,730
spreads financial gain through illegal

653
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:51,009
pradana the advanced persistent threat I

654
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,289
only just behave some whatever they sent

655
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,970
to a group especially the viagra stuff

656
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:58,029
well they need to steal intellectual on

657

term the term short to mid-term

660
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:08,340
financial gains they stealing corporate

661
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,529
information intellectual property

662
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,529
activist politically motivated religious

663
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:19,210
or environmental or personal beliefs by

664
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:22,179
themselves is oh they're out to

665
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,820
embarrass the face websites and easily

666
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:28,120
that they can easily slip into number

667
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,519
for being corporate things those are

668
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,860
malicious people they're not hackers

669
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,870
they just malicious people let's get the

670
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:40,269
term straight media that malicious

671
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:42,489
people cyber warriors we're using act

672
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:44,230
well talk right before me was about the

673
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,690
cyber warfare that they're doing more

674
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,970
building up cyber warfare for the

675
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:53,049
defense industry that's a great thing

676
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:56,200
but I'll disagree with CSO magazine on

677
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:58,480
this they're saying saint city-state

678
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,720
against city-state exploitation and game

679
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:07,360
to disable military capabilities may

680
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:10,480
operate in an APD or CSS sometimes yeah

681
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,340
but you also have people that are

682
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,529
building up within the military that are

683
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,990
smart and they're there to defend that's

684
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,169
a good thing you do have bad ones that

685
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:25,330
are out there against state-sponsored

686
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:28,149
rogue hackers basically they're out to

687
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,580
prove the skill bragging rights thrilled

688
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:32,949
to engage in unauthorized activities

689
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,519
make it system many criminals the

690
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:39,610
nuisances or nuisance and or their

691
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,899
script kiddies they are smart they know

692
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,479
what they're doing but there are

693
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:45,570
sometimes lazy they're just out there

694
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,170
for whatever

695
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:53,500
so let's turn it all around here this

696
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:56,410
one really makes you a real hacker real

697
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,080
hackers are people who have never have a

698
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,870
never-ending drive to learn they push

699
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,240
boundaries create things dig deep into a

700
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,100
subject discover new roads and and into

701
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,639
techniques discover new connections

702
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:12,520
between hardware and software they never

703
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:17,379
stop the learning process and/or the

704
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:20,020
process of discovery true hackers and

705
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,820
mathematicians scientists robots raw

706
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,400
data that are in robotics while

707
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,940
scientists and into robotics or software

708
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,889
network engineers programs physicians

709
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,380
specialists in any field from any walk

710
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:36,219
of life athletes gardeners plumbers

711
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:38,310
roofers ornithologist anyone who cannot

712
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,928
stop bettering themselves by learning

713
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:46,570
twisting things around to make a square

714
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:50,650
peg fit into an octagonal hole excuse me

715
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:53,800
I came back found look we've got one

716
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:56,320
more they're not evil they're just doing

717
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,410
their job pushing boundaries that exists

718
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,930
all around us they're trying to discover

719
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,740
new and ingenious ways to solve problems

720
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:08,620
that's the true hacker I come back from

721
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,390
the security conferences out in Las

722
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,700
Vegas and I had a doctor's appointment

723
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,710
I'll go see the doctor he says - have

724
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,509
you been traveling I said yeah I just

725
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,360
come back from Las Vegas she just great

726
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:21,580
you're out there on vacation right I

727
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:25,000
said well not really I said I'm out

728
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:27,190
there for business I went to a black hat

729
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,750
which is an IT security conference and I

730
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,840
went to DEFCON which is earlier hacker

731
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,790
conference sitting on his wheelie little

732
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,330
chair he pushed back and looked at me

733
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:40,779
went oh my god you're a hacker I'm

734
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:46,650
taking care of a hacker the nurses face

735
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,500
went wait and I start passing out

736
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:52,250
calling the cops

737
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:56,000
thing like that doctor you were a

738
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:59,180
student and what intrigued you and what

739
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,240
whet your whistle for knowledge was

740
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,680
medical industry he was well yeah I said

741
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,229
you went through college you got your

742
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,450
degrees from that you wanted to do more

743
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:11,390
you started becoming an intern you would

744
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,180
turn four for six years give or take all

745
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,589
of those was a while but all the time

746
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,960
you're learning you're studying you're

747
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:20,240
retesting yourself you push the limits

748
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,690
you kept going you became a doctor a

749
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,839
medical doctor did you stop learning he

750
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,910
does no I is it good you get all kinds

751
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,590
of pamphlets yet from the AMA and

752
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,700
everybody else and you're reading things

753
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,170
you're reading things from drug

754
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,410
companies which are evil but that's a

755
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,390
different story than know that all and

756
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,649
you but you're learning you're pushing

757
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,230
yourself you're trying to help your

758
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:45,560
patients he turned around and just all

759
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,280
those arms goes I never realized I was a

760
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,400
hacker

761
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,920
I said yarn the color came back to the

762
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,150
nurse's face and I might cool this out

763
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,990
here I want to something to be able to

764
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:59,240
catch it either but it's true once you

765
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:04,609
realize and once you tell people what

766
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:06,140
exactly a hacker is they think they back

767
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,930
off and they look at you and they go wow

768
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,220
I never thought of it that way

769
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:13,640
lashline I didn't finish it than online

770
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,350
that's my bed they're trying to be new

771
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,299
hackers or hackers are trying to

772
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:20,930
discover new and ingenious ways to solve

773
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:24,980
problems with a little amount of code as

774
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:28,580
possible and that's an inside job for

775
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:33,110
any program do have tutors have epics

776
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,779
why yes or they they do they just they

777
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:38,570
discourage blackhat hacking they

778
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,880
encourage white hat hacking they

779
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:43,670
encourage sharing of information I mean

780
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,620
you wouldn't have any kind without that

781
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,300
ethic of sharing the information that

782
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,720
people have learned with other people

783
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,240
it's that idea of sparking somebody that

784
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,879
will may follow in your footsteps or may

785
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,709
take that

786
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,980
information and build something bigger

787
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:02,310
and better and in turn they share with

788
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,180
their community they shared at another

789
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,400
con teaching teaching about hacking and

790
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:12,839
developing skills for others that will

791
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,330
follow hands on imperative the hacker

792
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,730
epic basically says you've got to have

793
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:22,110
your hands on the subject because that's

794
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:24,810
what is the right thing to do yeah I

795
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:27,180
agree with that because you can't always

796
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,009
learn everything out of a book or from a

797
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,350
certification you got to get into it

798
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,840
you've got to roll your sleeves up and

799
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,310
get dirty sometimes so it's a hands-on

800
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,670
type of thing

801
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:40,740
modern hackers well true to these hacker

802
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:43,620
ethics especially the hands-on

803
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,770
imperative are usually supportive of

804
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:49,380
free and open source software and that

805
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:54,540
is a true statement because the hackers

806
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:57,030
that started Linux they come up with an

807
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,520
idea or he came up with an idea what a

808
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:03,120
lot of the - bubbles came up with an

809
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,090
idea he built on it from there he got

810
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,190
other people involved Lenox today is one

811
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,680
of the most or if not the most popular

812
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:15,660
software that's out there popular

813
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:18,540
operating system so but I believe that

814
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,509
they should also have as an epic they

815
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,520
should also combine a morality and that

816
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,510
morality according to the dictionary

817
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,820
comm on morals principles of habit with

818
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,230
respect to what is right or wrong

819
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:37,590
is it wrong to break into a corporate

820
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:40,800
network yes if you do it without

821
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:44,100
permission and you get caught you should

822
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,400
be you should be or you should have the

823
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:51,690
law come on to come down on top of you

824
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,610
so the full extent no because you're

825
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,040
going to have red teams you're going to

826
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,540
have penetration testers that are out

827
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,640
there doing that job getting the

828
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,339
permission and that's the whole thing

829
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,078
they did it

830
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:04,269
they got permission to go in and do this

831
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,940
maybe they were hired to do it that's

832
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:11,368
awesome but the idea of combining an

833
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:14,559
epoch also with a little bit of morality

834
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:16,839
and that's what I believe truly believed

835
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,719
having dealt with hackers having dealt

836
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:22,239
with different people who throughout the

837
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:24,789
years that have even learned or

838
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,910
developed different software and

839
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:30,910
hardware they understand the differences

840
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:34,839
between right and wrong and sometimes

841
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:36,609
you even get a hacker that has been

842
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:38,558
malicious for many years gets arrested

843
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:41,380
spent times in jail wakes up to the fact

844
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,319
that I'm out there hacking to try to

845
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,349
make a living but I just got arrested my

846
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,479
name's all over the papers famous now I

847
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:52,329
should be able to make money on this and

848
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:54,038
they do they make a lot of money and

849
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:56,529
good for them and it's good that they

850
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,940
turn their life around to say I'm not

851
00:40:56,529 --> 00:41:01,869
going to be evil anymore would it be a

852
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:04,599
true hacker and that's good if you are

853
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:08,289
truly a hacker then the words cannot be

854
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:11,130
done or impossible or no an art product

855
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:14,410
part of your personal daily dictionary

856
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:16,119
never-ending thirst for knowledge we

857
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,390
come to these comps to learn something

858
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,979
new we go to a bookstore Santa say the

859
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,049
bookstores what do we have we only have

860
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:25,419
a couple that are out there now say to

861
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:27,788
say their aisles for technology have

862
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,499
dwindled so we go to Amazon we go to

863
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:32,430
some of the books up books-a-million

864
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:35,439
they got we go to other different places

865
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:39,069
one of the ones that I really enjoy is

866
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,440
the no starch press they have some great

867
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:44,890
books up there that were written by

868
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,710
hackers that's awesome

869
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,839
the idea of rewriting or recreation of

870
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,089
your old code or old ideas into new

871
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,759
techniques and new tricks and sharing

872
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:58,349
that information teaches and shares

873
00:41:54,759 --> 00:42:03,430
that's the definition of the true hacker

874
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:05,170
but my terminologies I'm going to throw

875
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,700
out a couple ones a hacker okay smart

876
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,780
overlearning person twisting and turning

877
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,250
Lysa problems

878
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:13,480
so they find a solution the macker

879
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,700
malicious hacker a person who learned

880
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,560
all this stuff but their militias I'll

881
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,460
just jokingly call them a Mac or they're

882
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,630
not a hacker

883
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:25,360
sorry little Riley I have a little bit

884
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,980
more of a slacker everybody knows that

885
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,660
sometimes they just want to slack off or

886
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,910
work or whatever but have you ever seen

887
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,649
people that learn a little bit if they

888
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:35,410
go and steal somebody else's code say

889
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:38,620
this is mine they're lazy just stop

890
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:40,930
being lazy get out learn there's so much

891
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:45,370
to be learned within the cyber security

892
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,990
within the computer and field a whacker

893
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,000
that's a wannabe hack or somebody who

894
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:52,899
thinks they are but they're not really

895
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,930
they just don't want to be I can go

896
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,820
through a couple different all the terms

897
00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:01,930
they're all about joking around with

898
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:05,200
that a backer of something that's for

899
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:07,560
pizza nuff said a backer hey look at

900
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,870
this usually includes pizza and beer

901
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,610
this one is a good one because if you're

902
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:15,370
going to use the term hacker and combine

903
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:17,980
it with another terminology like

904
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,350
somebody who loves to talk and they'll

905
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,720
talk and brag and if they start getting

906
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,250
too much alcohol into them they start

907
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,919
opening up and saying things that they

908
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:29,500
shouldn't be saying and if you're

909
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,440
sitting in a crowd of people and you

910
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:36,120
start bragging about a hack that you did

911
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,160
be careful the walls do have ears today

912
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:42,279
everybody is carrying around a cell

913
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,040
phone that could record or video what

914
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,260
you're saying and throw up on to YouTube

915
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:52,630
so if you just hack something don't brag

916
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:54,820
about it be proud but to yourself as

917
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,790
long as you don't hurt anybody so that's

918
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:02,290
basically the end of the talk it's been

919
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:04,720
a jovial type of thing that I think the

920
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,790
media has just blown the term hacker way

921
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,680
out of proportion and they should be

922
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:11,290
ashamed of that they should be utilizing

923
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,930
for what it is a hacker is a good person

924
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,830
a hacker somebody constantly learning

925
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:20,450
constantly twisting life's problems

926
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:23,060
well I say

927
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:26,750
at the end never there's always new ways

928
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:29,210
to discover how to do things better if

929
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:32,870
you better had that never-ending thirst

930
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:37,360
at any age race and nationality get out

931
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:39,910
there hack learn but do it in a sandbox

932
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,190
but while you're working in a sandbox

933
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:46,460
make sure you don't start stumbling over

934
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:48,710
the kiddie clumps and that's a joke for

935
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,200
anybody who's actually had kids out in

936
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,700
their yard they got a sandbox and the

937
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,520
kids start looking at things and picking

938
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:58,490
up things because technically in an

939
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:01,700
electronic sandbox if you don't pay

940
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,450
attention shits going to happen pay

941
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,149
attention

942
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,359
learn how to set up a sandbox correctly

943
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,710
and do all your hacking or your testing

944
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,050
there's so many different links that are

945
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:14,510
out there you set up capture the flag

946
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,520
things set up on your laptop set it up

947
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,650
at home make sure it doesn't go out

948
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:23,180
though because the less stuff is really

949
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:26,390
malicious that's basically it I hope

950
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,890
everybody had fun this is my this is my

951
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,790
second talk that I've actually ever done

952
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:34,580
the first talk a large company came to

953
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:36,950
me and says you're utilizing our product

954
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,020
you're probably the only person we know

955
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,029
of that is utilizing this for

956
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,030
application security could you write up

957
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:46,580
a dissertation and I did and I presented

958
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:50,600
it to New York State well the ISO is at

959
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:53,630
that time and it was a lot of fun and it

960
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:56,900
actually helped IBM a little bit better

961
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:59,950
to help get their product out there and

962
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,990
that was that skin the - duel

963
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,370
other than that I'm done y'all have a

964
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,600
great evening if there's any questions

965
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,600
to have viola

966
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:18,619
anybody seen the DEF CON badge for this

967
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:23,359
year what's really cool is don't we have

968
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:25,099
to DEFCON getting badges or getting

969
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,190
badges and building them yourself is

970
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:30,050
really really cool if you've never had

971
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:32,450
an opportunity to get into hardware

972
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:34,640
hacking and to wear a soldering and

973
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,680
learning how to do this well it's

974
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,230
hacking 101 really at the part of

975
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,618
hacking one alone I've got some other

976
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:46,910
things just here with me from hacker

977
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:50,089
warehouse the hacker or they called the

978
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:52,040
car hacking village at DEFCON badge if I

979
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:54,410
can find it it's probably one of the

980
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,700
most ingenious ones I've ever seen

981
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:00,680
it is so cool and I think I'm loud

982
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,790
enough I don't think I need the

983
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,078
