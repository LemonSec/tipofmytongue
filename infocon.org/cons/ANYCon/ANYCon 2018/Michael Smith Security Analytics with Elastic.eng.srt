1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,830
Oh fabulous yeah you're just you're

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,180
happy minutes me is like I may or may

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:17,369
not know enough about it that's fair

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:20,670
it's very better all right all right so

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,670
look my name is Mike I work at Symantec

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,609
I also teach at UAlbany in the School of

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,980
Business teaching different computer

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:34,230
science classes to business school

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,600
majors which is really fun and thank you

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,279
guys for your time okay and so you know

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
data is data and that's going to be a

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,090
theme here in this pitch remember the

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,730
data is data but security did is the

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,739
best so this is what we're going to

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,769
cover today security analytics in

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,680
general we talked about elastic briefly

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,329
just so that I understand the general

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,670
audience here quick show of hands how

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,820
many folks are familiar with elastic

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,379
like you've done at least one project

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,909
okay how many folks are wizards it

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,009
elastic I'm not I just keep my hand up

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,159
to demonstrate what to do okay good to

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,840
know

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,369
all right so I'm also going to talk

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,500
about the architecture components in

27
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,970
order to make the solutions work right

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,070
at a high level there has to be some

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,640
network configuration stuff's got to

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,939
talk locks a timeline is a Python

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,860
application that we use to create

32
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,720
timeline super timeline events out of

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,310
certain systems and talk about how I use

34
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,650
that sometimes I'm going to talk about

35
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,960
log stash then elastic search and then

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,030
Cabana then I'm going to give you some

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,949
examples the first example is going to

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,600
deal with Shakespeare if you're familiar

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,780
with kabandha you might know that their

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,939
very first tutorial is hey grab this

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,710
Shakespeare of JSON and then do a couple

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,199
things with it so we're going to use

43
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,689
that and then break into some security

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,430
specific examples lennox host data some

45
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,679
web logs and then some now

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,480
research data that I have access to and

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,390
just just show some kinds of things that

48
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,410
you can do with it with elastic none of

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,300
this is magic

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,300
none of this in and of itself is

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,500
necessarily whiz-bang the point is to

52
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
just sort of show you some of the cool

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,090
things we can do with the technology and

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,130
hopefully to maybe Kickstarter inspire

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,320
new ideas for you using technology to do

56
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,720
cool stuff with your data because again

57
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,150
to come back to the general point data

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,030
in our data analysis is data analysis

59
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,940
right so your set of fields might be

60
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,020
different from your set of fields

61
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,990
definitely different from your set of

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,820
fields but the general process we use to

63
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,770
take the data normalize the data analyze

64
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,500
the data present the data in a 20-year

65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,180
cost understands what's going on he's

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:46,230
going to generally speaking be the same

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:49,160
okay so just a quick note he turned up

68
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,399
the microphone just so just a quick note

69
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,480
the talk description that is in the book

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,209
said that I was going to look at the

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,040
xpac machine learning recipes in the

72
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,250
time between I started building this

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,260
talk in today the elastic licensing

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,860
model has changed and the xpac stuff is

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,620
no longer free that hurts me in many

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,239
ways and I'm just not going to give you

77
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,820
a presentation that you couldn't then

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,650
reproduce for free so I changed

79
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,260
basically I've built a new presentation

80
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,150
for you okay so we're going to start out

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,679
with an interactive discussion then

82
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,440
we're going to talk about configuring in

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,760
we're going to talk about usually when

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,530
people think about elastic they think

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,470
about logging monitoring and alerting in

86
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,900
this near real-time okay my current role

87
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,220
I do a lot of Incident Response so I had

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,560
this real interesting problem I had to

89
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,720
solve I have historical data but I still

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,510
want to use all these cool tools how do

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,209
I do that we're going to talk about that

92
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,890
and they talked about how we ingested it

93
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,540
and how we ultimately create analytic

94
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,548
capability there will not be any term

95
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,379
in this presentation all right so if you

96
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,560
were like really focused on the machine

97
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:59,319
learning part I apologize but I pulled

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,299
it out because it's not free right and

99
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,980
so then I said okay let's not talk about

100
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:08,670
stuff that's not pretty all right

101
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:13,319
we lost no problem

102
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:18,789
wasn't committed all right so thank you

103
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,099
xkcd just want to point out this is not

104
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,169
a talk about statistics right we're

105
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,330
concerned about answering specific

106
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:29,190
instances of security questions right I

107
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:32,380
don't care about like is it or is it not

108
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,060
mathematically valid what icater is can

109
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,550
I find out the information that helps

110
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,440
people make good decisions to keep their

111
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,449
system secure their data protected that

112
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,969
sort of thing right it's the difference

113
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:47,710
between the theory of whatever and

114
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,860
someone who is a first responder who

115
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,260
actually keeps people alive right so we

116
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,449
are more of the latter we were trying a

117
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,280
little bit down and dirty just find the

118
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,900
data we need to go do the things we need

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,900
to do to keep the system's up to keep

120
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,270
the data protected any mathematicians in

121
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,409
the room what you do is in boredom -

122
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,000
that's not what I'm getting at this is

123
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,699
not a presentation about specific you

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,440
know statistics per se the more mature

125
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,870
your security analysis capability

126
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,599
becomes the more you might need to build

127
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,280
more scientific answers right but when

128
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,719
you start you're just trying to answer

129
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,030
the question what the hell is going home

130
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,889
you know whom are you doing it what does

131
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,739
it mean that's what we're trying to do

132
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:30,010
right now as you iterate maybe you get a

133
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,229
lot of scientific as you go right lastly

134
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,860
try to remember as you're using any

135
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,500
technology

136
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,120
like this to soften your language

137
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,719
especially when going up management

138
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,629
change right

139
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:42,520
it's always possible that our data model

140
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,689
is a little bit incorrect or that we

141
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,400
don't have all the data we thought we

142
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,819
had and somehow we end up with an

143
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,638
incorrect answer so just remember that

144
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:54,610
also it is very very hard to prove a

145
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,629
native so try to remember that as well

146
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,389
when you're trying to use these data

147
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:00,789
systems don't fall into the trap of

148
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,800
thinking that you can prove every single

149
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:10,330
thing that you wish you could because

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:13,180
sometimes you just so from my

151
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,120
perspective stern analytics is just a

152
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,340
constant iterative process you're asking

153
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,099
questions answering questions trying to

154
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,830
understand and then you know washing

155
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:26,409
rinse repeat right so hopefully that's

156
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,818
pretty straightforward just as general

157
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:31,060
recommendation we always try to start

158
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:33,099
small ask an easy question first success

159
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,349
breeds success right asking these

160
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:37,029
question get an easy answer plug it back

161
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,969
into your understanding of the data and

162
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,889
then keep going and then you'll see how

163
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,050
we work through this we have ultimately

164
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:48,849
asking and answering harder questions as

165
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:51,009
we go so it seems like a lot of folks in

166
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,909
the room are familiar with elastic so

167
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,069
I'm not going to break out of the

168
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:56,319
presentation to click on these links but

169
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,849
I'm just gonna say you all probably are

170
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,919
able to do search engines better than I

171
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:01,810
am right it's very easy google elastic

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,710
and then you can read all of their

173
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,590
general information

174
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,840
what it is how it works high-level in

175
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,630
the beginning there was out right

176
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,369
elastics that search logstash news about

177
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,760
ELQ which was a really cool name right

178
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,010
now

179
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,330
we call that elastic because they gotta

180
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:24,550
be ready then then added beats which is

181
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,280
a new way they're pulling data that is

182
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,020
outside the scope of the talker tick

183
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,080
it's really really cool but it's just

184
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,580
not insights about what I'm talk about

185
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,969
the VEX link right here you can see they

186
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,190
already have predefined solutions for

187
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,500
all sorts of different security data

188
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,920
issues right so medication logs cut up

189
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,450
data net flow of DNS sim so you can go

190
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,950
and you can look at that and then try to

191
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,539
replicate work that they've already vote

192
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,539
for you and that's pretty good

193
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,440
so these dance this dated years directly

194
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,570
off of their website okay elasticsearch

195
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,060
is a distributed restful search and

196
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:09,030
analytics engine right okay we get

197
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,470
that's the core logstash

198
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,770
open source server side data processing

199
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:17,920
pulls in data transforms it sends it

200
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,680
back to your favorites - Cabana is the

201
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,430
web front-end right and that's all it is

202
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,960
now just for the record I love this tool

203
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,820
I'm giving a whole talk about how to use

204
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,390
this tool but these are some pretty

205
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:35,370
salesy definitions right and from my

206
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:38,220
perspective they're not 100% helpful so

207
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,500
just bear with me

208
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:45,160
this is the order that we use that right

209
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:48,130
we use flog steps to ingest data we

210
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,740
stuff that data into elasticsearch we

211
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:56,710
use the Capano web front-end to query

212
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:59,970
data i'm old brain doesn't work like i

213
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,830
wish it did anything simple for me i

214
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,840
wish that they had just presented it

215
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,750
this way from the very beginning the

216
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,180
problem is that lek is just not

217
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,870
cool name right so we have to need a

218
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:17,939
help because there's joy because that's

219
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:20,490
an animal but really you load the data

220
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,910
you have the data you use a web

221
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:30,440
front-end access today that's how the

222
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:32,790
tools and most of you already here so

223
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,650
knock on wood someone was making fun of

224
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,610
me that I'm doing a live demo today

225
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,400
so knock on glass think of some sort we

226
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,190
have my laptop right here I have a

227
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:48,270
server that's in an AWS instance I get

228
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:51,540
to that with public key authentication I

229
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:55,220
then have tunnel setup where I'm

230
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,500
tunneling my web traffic through my xsh

231
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,510
connection okay does anybody have any

232
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,450
questions about this line right here

233
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,300
does everybody understand how to do SSH

234
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,390
files we're all cool with that right

235
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:14,400
fairly straightforward you know not

236
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:16,350
really a big deal but I just SSH giving

237
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,790
my login name and basically saying this

238
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,120
part of the localhost is going to go

239
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,270
this port to the target server I did

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,620
that and that's what's going to allow me

241
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,380
to browse and it's all going to go

242
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,630
through my xsh tunnel and then there are

243
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,770
some access controls how many folks have

244
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:39,140
AWS experience only a few okay let me

245
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:42,030
pause this for a second AWS is not hard

246
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,939
it's a little scary because it's clique

247
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:47,459
you have to click on like 15 things

248
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,060
before your stuff pops up and is working

249
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:55,470
and invariably your eyes are going to be

250
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,888
in the wrongs VPC or your security group

251
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,459
is going to get funny and then you

252
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,540
confused but here's the glory then you

253
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,248
throw it all the way and start over

254
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,019
right so it's not needed to lose

255
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:08,109
anything you only took a minute to do

256
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:10,449
the clip so with AWS how it works

257
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:12,730
you have your virtual server yet also

258
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:15,549
whatever you want you make sure it's on

259
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,919
the correct network then they have a

260
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:21,069
thing called security group the security

261
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,049
group looks an awful lot like what 15

262
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:26,319
years ago we could call firewalls

263
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:29,410
right where we just say I'm going to

264
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:32,410
allow access from this network range to

265
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,488
port 22 which is SSH thank you very much

266
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:39,579
right so in my case I from my laptop VPN

267
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:41,350
into my corporate network then my

268
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:44,199
security group rule and Amazon says

269
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:48,689
allow the Symantec corporate network to

270
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:53,618
access this host on port 22 make sense

271
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:56,079
groovy zooming through on time we're

272
00:11:53,619 --> 00:12:00,910
done okay

273
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:05,709
so loading the data in just a link okay

274
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:08,738
for the log to Timeline the situation

275
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:10,959
here is say I have some Linux data if

276
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:14,949
you have a Linux host or some Linux

277
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,529
evidence I want to create a super

278
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:20,529
timeline of every single file on this

279
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:23,110
Linux instance I do that with logs a

280
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,019
timeline and this is how I do it that's

281
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,419
the logs time behind up by the output is

282
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,850
going to be output that plazo and then

283
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:35,049
this input directory is every single

284
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:38,589
Linux folder that I wanted to include in

285
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:43,299
the process okay once that's all been

286
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:47,649
processed I use piece or output directly

287
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:49,449
to elastic on my local lobe so obviously

288
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,840
our running this command on my analysis

289
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:56,160
server

290
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:58,660
right sending the data over for 9200

291
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,730
this is whatever the name of the index

292
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,829
is and then the source stuff Lazo is

293
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,470
this output that lot so that I started

294
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,630
with so I start with operating system

295
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,060
data I turn it into a super timeline

296
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,630
then I use P sort to load the super

297
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,160
timeline into elastic in just a few

298
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,670
minutes we'll be looking at the Linux

299
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,180
data and that's how we got it in right

300
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,430
now this is sort of embarrassing but I

301
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:32,079
just have to admit it the very best

302
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:34,060
reference I have for how to create a log

303
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,090
stash configuration file is in the

304
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,540
answer to a stack overflow question go

305
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,850
figure

306
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,599
the actual documentation for this is not

307
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:47,080
the best but this link gives us a

308
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,160
fantastic excellent explanation and what

309
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,490
they're basically telling you this

310
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,939
listen you have three sections we have

311
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,620
input filter and output you configure

312
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,410
those such to those sections correctly

313
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,110
then you run a lot of Spanish - it means

314
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,750
with this file as my comp file and then

315
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:09,040
give it the path to the con file does

316
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:17,290
that all make sense all right so I will

317
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:20,430
show some of that actually get access to

318
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,430
the internet works that's something

319
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,810
getting parade trying to show up in and

320
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,340
out of the presentation we'll see if you

321
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,119
can get back into the presentation right

322
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:41,350
so this is what that Kampai looks like

323
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:46,810
right you just say input file what the

324
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:49,150
path is start position all right then

325
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,130
it's it's whatever your arbitrary CSV is

326
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,350
whatever the columns are you columns in

327
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,560
and then you say you're going to output

328
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,770
to elasticsearch localhost one for 9200

329
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,510
in this case this is their index you

330
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,630
just change that to whatever your DX is

331
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:10,480
right that's just super pretty and makes

332
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:12,130
perfect sense and then they talk here

333
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,060
about how to use it and the different

334
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,689
problems it's personal time and

335
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,270
what-have-you but again funnily enough

336
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,190
this Stack Overflow the person had a

337
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:25,210
question and some answers and then

338
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,370
that's the command to run for me was the

339
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,290
best explanation I had seen an exacta

340
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,290
sort of how that works okay

341
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:45,889
yeah it works

342
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:47,389
bravery okay so we're not going to bore

343
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:49,370
you from watching a bunch of data that

344
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,500
you can't read five out of screen but

345
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,990
when you do that right when you've

346
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,160
configured your comm file then you said

347
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:01,730
bin log stash - f path to my comm file

348
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,879
this is what happens right in this case

349
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,459
I'm loading some malware research data

350
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,639
and the fields are IP address full of

351
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,810
that CIP device domain that's the domain

352
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,319
timestamp that's the time that I loaded

353
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:21,739
it message right in this case the

354
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:25,599
message is an md5 a domain and an IP

355
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,639
address I'm separated then the path is

356
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,910
the local system path to the file that's

357
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,860
being processed the host and then the

358
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,509
ultimate entity files are these all of

359
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,970
these fields with all of these values

360
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:39,199
you will see in just a minute right so

361
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:45,439
that's what it looks like when you load

362
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,029
the data there in flow things you have

363
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,800
to do with elastic to manage the data

364
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,029
store now again I don't want I'm going

365
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,139
to go through this quick because most of

366
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,019
you said you already have some

367
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,910
experience here when I was just starting

368
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:00,439
to learn how to use this technology this

369
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:04,099
confused me for more minutes than I want

370
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:06,319
to admit okay there's two critical

371
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,448
things you need in order to have the

372
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,809
data and then to be able to query the

373
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,819
data and they're almost exactly the same

374
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:17,809
which then makes it confusing right

375
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,849
there's an index the index system for

376
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,189
better or it's like the database right

377
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:22,990
it has a mapping which defines types and

378
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,029
then you put

379
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,220
so there's an index that has to be

380
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,190
created and you can do that in the dev

381
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,870
tools you can also do that with curl or

382
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,580
in the bar I suppose with a post or

383
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,729
something so you have to create the

384
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:40,299
index and that is done on the elastic

385
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,529
search side right and we remember that

386
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,480
elastic searches of the datastore

387
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:46,120
combine so we create an index on the

388
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,750
datastore then we have to create an

389
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,120
index pattern which funnily enough is

390
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,850
usually the name of your index with a

391
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,649
while apart at the end right so it's

392
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,639
very similar and the index pattern gets

393
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:02,879
created in the web front-end and you use

394
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,220
that index patter to retrieve data from

395
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,690
the elastic search index and you use

396
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,260
that for the different visualizations

397
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,820
and that sort of thing so all I'm trying

398
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,299
to say here is that it gets elastic

399
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,580
search it's an index and you deal with

400
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,889
index management and then if it's in

401
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,149
Cabana it's an index pattern and you

402
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:27,570
configure the index path if it seems a

403
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:30,219
little pedantic I agree

404
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,600
but please just trust me if you get it

405
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,490
confused you then feel like you're

406
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:39,158
knucklehead and then you realize what

407
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:41,970
you've done so now let's talk about

408
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:47,169
using the front-end a little bit right

409
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:50,039
so someone who has some experience what

410
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,039
is this first one good

411
00:18:52,100 --> 00:19:00,199
it's gonna list it should list out the

412
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:02,090
indexes do we agree all right and then

413
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,820
some one here this one would look at the

414
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,820
cluster okay so let's just for a moment

415
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,450
let's see if we can do this and see what

416
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:20,350
happens

417
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:20,350
all right these things get really brave

418
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:27,920
doing stuff on the command line

419
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,390
certainly frightening Newark it works so

420
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,800
fast we probably almost don't believe it

421
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:37,190
worked but there you are right everybody

422
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,010
knows the curl is anyone not know what

423
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,340
curly to be briefed yeah thank you so

424
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,820
much

425
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,129
so curl is a text based application that

426
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,290
you can use as a browser it's like a

427
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:53,360
super super minimal text-based

428
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:56,540
browser okay so I'm just saying curl do

429
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,570
it get to local host on this port this

430
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,510
URI right this path and then here are

431
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,770
all the indices pretty groovy all right

432
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:09,320
now

433
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:10,580
I make this part orange on purpose just

434
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,570
to show that there's more than one way

435
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:16,699
to do things all right maybe you need to

436
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,220
use it in curl for whatever reason okay

437
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:23,900
there so that's totally fine

438
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:26,530
but you can also do it in your browser

439
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,580
right just get rid of the curl part

440
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,270
right you saw what I did there right I

441
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,889
just local those 9200 the path

442
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,290
underscore cat slash into see these blah

443
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:41,660
blah blah and then you can look at all

444
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:43,550
of our data sees that so I ran into this

445
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,510
stuff all the time there's a certain

446
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:50,480
type of person mad mad mad it is going

447
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,129
to think that you have to do it with

448
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,929
you've got a heart it's really possible

449
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,150
you have to wear a black t-shirt

450
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,559
everywhere you go

451
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,179
I'm totally buying these black t-shirts

452
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,250
by the way because they're awesome so I

453
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,260
have no issues with black teams but you

454
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,520
know what I'm talking about right like

455
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,490
eggheads you do it hard on purpose

456
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,510
listen this tool is for everybody if you

457
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,890
want to do it with the command line

458
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,740
there's a lot of good reasons to do so

459
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,390
but there's also no problem with using

460
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,820
the browser and just checking some stuff

461
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,840
out that my whole point is just to say

462
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:24,439
that you could do it multiple different

463
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:27,949
ways okay alright and this is the very

464
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,260
same kind of thing cluster health right

465
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,179
so maybe I'll just you know as a part of

466
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,580
the script I you know that would be a

467
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,799
reason to do this on the command line to

468
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,149
curl maybe it would be part of the

469
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,629
script or something that every day I

470
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,340
would check my cluster health right but

471
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,059
now just for whatever I wanted to check

472
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:50,750
in mmm-hmm I gave my cluster or a really

473
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:52,940
awesome name by the way there's only one

474
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,179
server but it's still a cluster don't

475
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,179
ask

476
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,679
that's why the status is yellow because

477
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,210
it's not named I don't really have it

478
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:08,059
back right so you see number of nodes

479
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,380
right number of data knows active shards

480
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,168
and you just have all this nice

481
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,990
information about the health of your

482
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,160
instance big deal but that's how you use

483
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:22,130
it you can do it with the command line

484
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,870
or with your browser so I took the

485
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,790
moment to talk about indexes and index

486
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,620
patterns you obviously need to create

487
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,730
indexes if you're going to do stuff with

488
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:36,979
Devon there are also multiple ways to do

489
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:40,120
that however I'll show you what I

490
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,120
believe to be the easiest way

491
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,549
I don't know

492
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,450
Bonnell listens on 5601 by default so

493
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,770
when I just say localhost on my browser

494
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,450
it tries to go like Ford 80 ran I hate

495
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,870
any mistakes but I mean this dates all

496
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,760
the time

497
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:13,040
okay all right so dev tools fantastic

498
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,090
right so right in here is where you

499
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,780
would use your dev tools to create an

500
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,780
index

501
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,879
and you can also recently there are some

502
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:38,309
additions for c-cool searching so you

503
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:56,668
can use sequel type syntax to do some

504
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:58,590
searching I'm gonna move on in the

505
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,299
essence of time but I promise it works

506
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,418
and I'll come back to it at the end to

507
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,549
show to you that's my mistake

508
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:07,739
presentation so then we can do some

509
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,389
direct browsing we can use primarily we

510
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,970
need to discover we can use some

511
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:17,039
visualizations in the dashboard so let's

512
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:18,570
get into that just a little bit right so

513
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,220
you remember I talked about index path

514
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,549
as you see this right here shaykhs

515
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,330
star that lets you know that we're

516
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:28,440
querying the sheets peer data set right

517
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:35,549
so maybe I want to know about the

518
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:40,739
speaker and the play name and the text

519
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:44,629
entry right you're just already safe so

520
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm looking here maybe I am interested

521
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:52,219
for whatever reason in text entry

522
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,440
that's showing all the lines that has

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,929
the word love in the handle in the life

524
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,740
right does it change

525
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:09,380
that's a lovely change there's 1857 hits

526
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,510
of love unchaste them okay that's just

527
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,230
using discovery I'm going to continue on

528
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,970
with this example in just a minute

529
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:20,809
visualize is where you can create

530
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:29,269
visualizations that you can use later so

531
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:32,840
Shakespeare line count by play right so

532
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:35,990
this is how many lines by play now this

533
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,379
is really what separates the exits from

534
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:41,750
the cool people so if you think why show

535
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,820
you next it's really cool then you're an

536
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,070
egghead like me and just we should

537
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,408
accept it if you don't think it's you

538
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:54,980
cool probably means it's because you're

539
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:59,029
so cool but but wait for it okay so I

540
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:04,429
can do my Lucene query right I can do my

541
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:10,370
filter right and I can immediately apply

542
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:13,880
my filter to my visualizations so the

543
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:16,189
real smart prep work is to create

544
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,919
visualizations that then empower

545
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,710
analysts to ask cool questions and get

546
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,519
cool answers wicked fast and already

547
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,960
graphed for you right so for me that is

548
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,950
really really cool now if I wanted to

549
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,320
write and there are going to be people

550
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:38,510
who solve the problem this way to line

551
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,250
count by play love okay so you save the

552
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:45,408
visualization with the search already

553
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:47,389
hit right now let's just say that I'm

554
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:51,289
starting a punk band and that band is

555
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:53,479
called love-hate robot and I'm

556
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,908
interested in drawing a connection

557
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,539
between love hate robot and chicks it's

558
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:02,419
part of my marketing plan just roll

559
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:05,429
okay so if I built the solution this way

560
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:07,679
I've got to create 3d visualisations

561
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:09,239
right and there's some value to that

562
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,489
because maybe I want to see all three of

563
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:14,369
them at once and if that's what I want

564
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:18,119
fun creating three visualizations and do

565
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:19,918
that most of my job as an analyst isn't

566
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,149
creating the digitalization so I'm just

567
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,889
trying to find out the answer to the

568
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:30,018
question so for me personally right I

569
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:33,869
would prefer the more granular

570
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:37,769
visualization where I could then say

571
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:39,478
there were 1857 lines in the entire

572
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:41,789
purpose of Shakespeare the happy we're

573
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:52,559
11 okay well that's great

574
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:57,989
now instead of eight there are much less

575
00:27:52,559 --> 00:28:02,059
by the way right like 18 16 you know

576
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:06,359
much less much less neat in Shakespeare

577
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:11,489
that's good now because we're all trying

578
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:14,960
to use this tool to be analysts how many

579
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:19,649
how many plays have the word robota zero

580
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,320
you're a wizard wizard out okay

581
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:23,969
absolutely they're zero zero Shakespeare

582
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,239
plays that have the word robot in them

583
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:32,519
we are not surprised right let me just

584
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:35,580
pause to say this is a really important

585
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,399
part of the analysis you expect for no

586
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:42,478
results to be returned make sure no

587
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:45,238
results are returned it just helps avoid

588
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:46,919
embarrassing problems later when I

589
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:48,899
search for a robot and it gives me some

590
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:53,399
answer that's clearly not correct which

591
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:56,488
means I have a problem right oh very

592
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,299
very cool you are all super patient and

593
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:59,580
super awesome

594
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,769
now I said I was going to give you my

595
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,669
demo

596
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:06,550
I loved / thank you

597
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,870
bye-bye and you would you know he would

598
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:12,820
definitely be saying I got to get me

599
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:14,139
some of that right we've already started

600
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,520
going through Shakespeare I'm just not

601
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,540
popping the whole slide that back up

602
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,340
again because I'm going to go right back

603
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,500
into the looking right it's really a

604
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,560
pretty example it's not security data

605
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,300
some of you are ready to get out but I

606
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,760
just wanted to show you couple things

607
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,560
number one just look at the general

608
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,030
concept right like how will the Tool

609
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:37,179
Works number two it's pretty fast right

610
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:38,560
it's really fast on text data which is

611
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,840
awesome so that means you can have

612
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,230
arbitrary data it doesn't have to be a

613
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,850
relational database I'm old it took a

614
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,980
long time for me to get over the fact

615
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:52,449
that this is not a relational database I

616
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:55,930
just throw it all in and then type

617
00:29:52,450 --> 00:30:02,530
Google like queries and then I get

618
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:04,840
answers group right okay so you talk

619
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:08,680
about that so who's ready for a slightly

620
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,689
better demo so we're going to look at a

621
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,880
field parser and then we're going to

622
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,110
filter out file step and we're going to

623
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,640
talk about that for a minute hopefully

624
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,620
one of you is going to ask the big

625
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,830
question or maybe at least just talk it

626
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:24,100
all all right and then ultimately we're

627
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:27,090
going to search for petrol keeping it

628
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:31,629
pretty basic for right now all right

629
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,790
okay so now just so that you believe

630
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:41,970
that I did it on purpose about to make

631
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:41,970
mistake what's my mistake

632
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm searching the wrong is I absolutely

633
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:57,770
agree how do you know that because it

634
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:01,790
says right here shakes right I I'm using

635
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:07,240
the index pattern shake star which is

636
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:11,330
referencing the index Shakespeare oops

637
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,580
of course that didn't now I set that up

638
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,919
is this like fantastic Socratic example

639
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,710
in my day-to-day life give you all the

640
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,480
time you will to don't worry just tell

641
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:27,560
whoever's watching and that's what you

642
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:30,100
do alright so Linux evidence stuff right

643
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,740
that's probably the one we want to Avery

644
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:38,000
so basically that's just like selecting

645
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:41,320
the whole new data's now because the

646
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,070
tool is you know more or less free in

647
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:48,350
the instance I'm using it anyway you do

648
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,120
get a couple of weird old uppers and so

649
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,830
just please if you're new to the tool or

650
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,169
whatever and your claim with it don't

651
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:57,980
get discouraged or frustrated it held

652
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,300
onto this square right it thinks I might

653
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,850
want to use it or something so let's

654
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,850
just delete it to get rid of it okay oh

655
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:10,310
no I'm doing the presentation in front

656
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,919
of roughly thirty people all my data is

657
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:16,720
gone I don't know what to do what's

658
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,720
actually happening to me anybody

659
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:25,779
is it likely that the forensic analysis

660
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,639
that I have normalized and then in

661
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:31,690
presenting to you having 15 minutes ago

662
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:34,059
no this is a huge gap chip in the tool

663
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,100
it always defaults to the last 15

664
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:38,678
minutes because the use case they're

665
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,340
thinking of is near real time monitor

666
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,500
right but I'm looking at historically so

667
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,449
I've changed to the Linux evidence star

668
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,380
I think I'm looking at my right dataset

669
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,870
I think I'm doing all the right things

670
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,639
and then I freaked out because I forgot

671
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,939
that way over here in this upper right

672
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:56,678
hand corner and when I do something like

673
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,399
that like show me all the data over the

674
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,370
last five years

675
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:02,408
ha a million hits that's better that

676
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,908
sounds more like what I did right so

677
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:06,519
remember we talked about a couple slides

678
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,830
ago I used blog to Timeline on a whole

679
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,380
bunch of Linux file system folders

680
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:14,199
created a super timeline out of that

681
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:18,519
which is a dot Plaza file I then used P

682
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,669
store to dump that plazo file in to a

683
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:24,190
less there's a million records a little

684
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:28,840
more than a million records took about

685
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:31,000
six hours to do which is a kind of slow

686
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,639
that I was disappointed at the took so

687
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,419
long but that's how long ago I ran it

688
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:39,428
overnight and by the way this is a real

689
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:41,380
live case like I had a real live

690
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:43,870
customer they they paid us read-aloud

691
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,820
money because they have a problem on

692
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,250
this particular interesting ly enough it

693
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,669
wasn't a bare-metal system

694
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,590
it was a a virtualized system inside of

695
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,650
a docker container that was being

696
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,510
managed with LXE okay so I took this

697
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,810
posting that did all this stuff to it

698
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,950
and dumped it in here now remember I

699
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,010
warned you that there are still these

700
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:07,560
wonky parts of the UI is there a speaker

701
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,949
and a planing and a text entry for linux

702
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,049
evidence that star abscess ticularly not

703
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,509
so it wouldn't have been nice if they

704
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,179
had refreshed for me I'm sure there's a

705
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,280
reason it doesn't okay but all I know is

706
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,790
that it's scary to mean slightly

707
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,710
irritated no big deal so let's add

708
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,029
parser because I gave you a clue that we

709
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,620
were going to be interested in our

710
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:37,200
school right and that message I'm sorry

711
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:39,418
Platt message is the catch all right

712
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,730
it's the entire record a lot of the

713
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,699
other fields are basically parsed out

714
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,510
parts of message so when I'm doing my

715
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,830
analysis I just start with message and

716
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,129
then maybe I use other fields when I

717
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:55,918
need to now here's the interesting thing

718
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:58,230
like check out how cool this is click on

719
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,540
the plus magnify device to filter for

720
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,580
the value value the - magnifying glass

721
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,090
to filter out the values - check this

722
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:11,340
out

723
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:12,930
I have a lot less data down right this

724
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,750
is an artifact of the way that I

725
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,520
collected the evidence there were

726
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:23,850
roughly a million files and the folder

727
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:27,030
structure I was analyzing I got a row in

728
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:30,810
my data set here for the date/time stamp

729
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,290
of every daggum file and the file size

730
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,290
right

731
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,390
I might ultimately need that but for my

732
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:39,690
first pass of analysis is it likely that

733
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:42,930
I care when a particular file is class

734
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:46,950
right probably not so I can get rid of

735
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:50,859
that now I know that it's on the Nexus

736
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:53,890
and I am especially concerned about any

737
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,270
sort of user activity that was incorrect

738
00:35:53,890 --> 00:36:01,560
with a stick

739
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:01,560
do you okay so I was looking at so

740
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,890
gosh-darn

741
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,820
autocorrect right you saw that right be

742
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:13,900
a sswd

743
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:18,730
right I promise that this was not a

744
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,110
doctor dataset this was a real case but

745
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,840
it was just a great example to use

746
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:25,660
exactly one record was Pinter and was

747
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:31,080
returned okay and a little over a year

748
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:33,700
ago 2017-2018 a little over a year ago

749
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,220
the password for the user of about 2 was

750
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:42,390
changed by the user root and that's the

751
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:47,410
process I think I've heard that it and

752
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:51,490
then if you click here to expand this is

753
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:57,790
all the detailed data we have about that

754
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:58,959
record okay now I thought we've got tons

755
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,400
of time and then now I've apparently

756
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,190
slowed down so I'm going to zoom on

757
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,590
anyone ask questions just feel free like

758
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,590
dive in and ask there yes sir

759
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,550
help me understand like in delaying

760
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,050
terms like what is it elastic do that's

761
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,060
so great I mean if you're showing

762
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:35,490
awesome results about how does it do

763
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:37,970
that very great question okay the short

764
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:42,930
answer is that the under the hood part

765
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:45,359
is a bunch of sort of notes equal tank

766
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,270
technologies that are happening in the

767
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:53,070
elastic search piece of that logstash

768
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:55,680
elastic search and component right I'm

769
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:59,190
not really an expert so I can't tell you

770
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,919
too much more beyond like that it's all

771
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:05,490
happening what makes it so great right

772
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:10,470
is that they abstract that for us right

773
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:13,169
I don't have to know how the internals

774
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,270
of the database works to query the

775
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,820
database and that that's kind of what's

776
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,710
happening here right I can just yeah I

777
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,600
can just use my search bar but that's a

778
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,090
great question and it's something that

779
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,860
I'm happy to look it up for you with you

780
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,230
and then we'll sort it out but that's a

781
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,820
super good question all right so I want

782
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:34,160
to move on to looking at some of patchy

783
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:37,460
web blocks real quick because I did I

784
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,460
also have a

785
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:52,840
let's go here container actually - let's

786
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:57,580
remove that here all right

787
00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:00,110
now this is my dashboard now a dashboard

788
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,610
is nothing more than a collection of

789
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,200
visualizations right so I've showed you

790
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,430
a handful of visualizations now I

791
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,350
thought it was really groovy to have a

792
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:12,020
bunch of them together so I put them all

793
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:14,839
on a network blue down here you would

794
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,700
see a list of IP addresses I told you

795
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,550
before this is a real live case that I

796
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,439
was working on so I removed all the IP

797
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,060
addresses from the visualization let's

798
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,850
protect the innocents as well as the

799
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:33,230
guilty okay so whoever you know thinks

800
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:37,400
they're not super technical which one of

801
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:40,420
these rows here is the one who do you

802
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,420
think I'm going to look at first

803
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,399
yeah which one of the bars you're ready

804
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:51,058
it's called I'm sorry the big yeah

805
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,380
absolutely right

806
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:54,589
the very first one I'm gonna look at is

807
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:00,180
gosh this particular IP address

808
00:39:54,589 --> 00:40:03,869
generated you know almost 12,000 log

809
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,399
lines in the last 30 days now I don't

810
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:07,950
want to hover over Thailand you see all

811
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:14,539
about the IP address but there is all

812
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:17,098
right all right whatever okay so great

813
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:19,559
as it turns out that was definitely the

814
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,539
person the background was this

815
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,270
individual found at what vulnerability

816
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,490
and then trying to prove their ability

817
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,109
to exploit it and then presented

818
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,029
themselves as an information security

819
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,730
researcher and suggested that the

820
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:35,700
company pay them a lot of them the

821
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,920
company said that's not how responsible

822
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,549
of all ability disclosure works you're

823
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,289
breaking the law got me involved got my

824
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:45,150
company involved and then we had a

825
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:46,500
little lunch space so one of the things

826
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,240
we did was say yep this is definitely

827
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,589
the person and this is where that IP

828
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,259
address was all stood and this is where

829
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:53,759
they lives and all of that stuff which

830
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,700
interestingly enough the individual gave

831
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,289
their real live phone number in there

832
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,390
you know what technically was an

833
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,829
extortion attempt although they worded

834
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,930
it just right that they felt like it

835
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:06,150
wasn't expression right they gave out

836
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,410
their own phone number this is like how

837
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,930
not to be a criminal yes sir

838
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,870
this organization

839
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:14,839
no they do not have a public bounty

840
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:16,730
program so here's where it was really

841
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,500
interesting and this is just hopefully

842
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,510
relevant right legs of folks that are

843
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,610
like listen I like breaking stuff I

844
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:27,380
totally like breaking stuff but if it's

845
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:29,540
not your stuff be careful all right just

846
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,000
be careful so I've been involved in a

847
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,380
number of cases like this right this

848
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,700
individual thought they were doing

849
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,080
something good we're hoping to get a

850
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,529
financial reward for doing something

851
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,370
good but the way they presented it was

852
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:45,320
not the best okay so first of all after

853
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:49,370
they found it the part where they sent

854
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:57,560
12,000 more web requests over the span

855
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:59,630
of 54 minutes okay had they said

856
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,759
something like hit listen I'm a little

857
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:05,080
bit aficionado I know a little bit about

858
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,440
this stuff I kind of stumble onto this I

859
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:12,020
want to respect your systems but this is

860
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,060
what I think I saw you guys don't happen

861
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,759
to have balanced program either you know

862
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,710
like there's a way to share the

863
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,350
information that you find that doesn't

864
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,870
scare the bejesus out of people this

865
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,670
person did not do that so then then I

866
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:29,390
got pulled in and then they're like can

867
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,650
you prove he did nothing else right the

868
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,620
first thing I said was how do you know -

869
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,160
he but then it was because he provided

870
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,160
his real phone

871
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:46,180
okay so beyond is knocking on the door

872
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:48,609
well an argument can be made when you

873
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:51,160
expose an API to the Internet

874
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,540
right and that's what happened these

875
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,098
were API is that which should have been

876
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,740
internal but they were exposed to the

877
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:59,349
Internet so I don't mean to get to the

878
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,790
last one to them about yet which country

879
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:02,920
was the server in which country was the

880
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,740
researcher in supposed researcher they

881
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,619
were both in the United States so I'm

882
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:12,459
not alone or I played on television all

883
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:15,280
that I am saying as a technologist when

884
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:18,040
you find the vulnerability and you have

885
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,780
not already been paid and contracted and

886
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,329
are protected under a limitation of

887
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,550
Liability to perform vulnerability scan

888
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:26,170
right if you're a professional pen

889
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,579
tester which I have done that job for

890
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,740
years and years and years if you're a

891
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,020
professional pen tester you don't touch

892
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,270
the system until you get that scope work

893
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:36,970
because as part of it that's good work

894
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:39,599
does is it provides you authorization it

895
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:42,279
provides limitations of liability right

896
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,310
like it usually like the limitation of

897
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,140
liability is the so the total dollar

898
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,460
value of the get so that means at

899
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,440
pentester the worst thing that can

900
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,170
happen to me is I get paid zero dollars

901
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,970
for the gig right as opposed to you can

902
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:00,339
come in the repo my house right so just

903
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:02,109
remember the next time you're a Robin

904
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:06,279
Hood on the internet who has found this

905
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:08,020
thing you're walking without a net right

906
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,450
you don't have a limitation liability so

907
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,170
please tread light is my random side you

908
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,080
know fast

909
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,640
so moving on all right check this out I

910
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,690
think this is super cool too if you

911
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,640
think this is cool you're an egghead

912
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,810
like me we should drink beer if you

913
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,850
don't think this is cool it's because

914
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:27,279
you're cooler than me we should still

915
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:31,440
thank you okay so there were this many

916
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,060
to hundreds what is HTTP response 200

917
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,040
okay all right well that's cool check

918
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,870
this out

919
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,620
if I double-click on it it immediately

920
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:43,450
turned it into a filter it doesn't have

921
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,370
to be hard and make it easy for us right

922
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:51,370
I think that's really super cool all

923
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:53,890
right by the way our person had the most

924
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:57,730
200 salsa which one expected hey that's

925
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:00,310
pretty neat well let's edit this filter

926
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:04,900
for a second though response that

927
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:08,680
keyword is not 200 let's run that

928
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,240
instead our person is still goes because

929
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,609
they just dominated everything I think

930
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,259
we're just there the only person bangin

931
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:19,570
on this thing at this time right but

932
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:22,120
this is Ruby information because this is

933
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:23,530
showing me the 500 to the 404 is the 302

934
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,520
is right this is showing me all of the

935
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:29,080
errors that got generated right if I

936
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:34,210
wanted to leave their IP address up on

937
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:37,900
the screen a little longer now I can see

938
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:42,640
all of them just by our particular

939
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:48,130
individual right the point of your

940
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:51,609
boss's lost their mind right because I

941
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:56,640
clicked on a button and they saw

942
00:45:51,610 --> 00:46:00,730
everything the perpetrator had done I

943
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,170
was in I was golden but it did at that

944
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,360
point in the gig it doesn't matter what

945
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,490
else I do like I haven't wanted right

946
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,090
the customer is going to think I am a

947
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:12,870
wizard like Gandalf with nothing

948
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:16,140
there's me right because I have pretty

949
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:18,029
pictures that are dynamic Frank and I'm

950
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,009
not going to be insulting of executives

951
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,740
right that executives have a very short

952
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,970
attention span for a reason they've got

953
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,220
a lot of different things they have to

954
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,020
do if it takes you fifty five minutes to

955
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:32,069
explain something to them you've lost

956
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:34,920
them right so dynamic graphics boom boom

957
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:37,560
boom and they felt like they understood

958
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,770
and so that's what made them happen all

959
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,750
right

960
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:44,940
just assuming on this is also an

961
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:48,480
interesting piece of data if you google

962
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,460
nodes super-agent you'll see that this

963
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,690
person was definitely amateur and what

964
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,770
they were doing and how they were doing

965
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:58,170
it big deal whatever this these are a

966
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:01,680
bunch of different access log files this

967
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:03,990
is just a heat map showing you that the

968
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,430
certain question was normally seen this

969
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:10,470
much traffic and then all of a sudden

970
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:12,390
right normally we see a hundred records

971
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:14,689
now we see a thousand records right I've

972
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:19,650
changed by the entire word magnitude

973
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:21,390
obviously something's going on okay any

974
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,870
questions about that before we move on

975
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,870
to the next example

976
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:36,630
no so again to side note my analysis

977
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:40,800
just for your general storytelling there

978
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:42,330
hey MA my take was this person was very

979
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,090
amateur there was evidence of the

980
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,520
amateur nature based on the number of

981
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:49,620
failed attempts based on the thousands

982
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,390
of repeat attempts that added no extra

983
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,529
value the person just sort of kept

984
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:56,509
clicking not because they thought it was

985
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:59,130
cool right so obvious amateur this was a

986
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:02,160
if there were crimes which I did not

987
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,450
concede if there were crimes they were

988
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,670
really committed out of ignorance not

989
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:08,098
out of deliciousness there was no actual

990
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:12,000
harm done to the company and my

991
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:15,240
suggestion was used this as a okay look

992
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,940
I need to encrypt my whatever use this

993
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,848
as a motivator to create a bounty

994
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,410
program perhaps you know we could

995
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:23,789
caution this individual a little bit

996
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,529
about they don't really appreciate this

997
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:26,009
I mean thank you but don't do this

998
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:29,789
anymore

999
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:32,640
it was my tape not trying to push my

1000
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:34,049
pockets on people but my general feeling

1001
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,078
is it that we have too many people in

1002
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:39,000
jail that we need working right so how

1003
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,589
about we give this person a little bit

1004
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,410
of education a little bit of

1005
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:45,319
encouragement you know and remind them

1006
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:49,950
about the decision is a liability

1007
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:51,660
okay something else happened to a kid

1008
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,058
like a real kid on the west coast

1009
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,890
same deal and like they had the FBI

1010
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:58,500
involved and they wanted to send this

1011
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:02,009
guy to jail and that's a really awkward

1012
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,140
conversation as a technologist you know

1013
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:07,019
and you've got this person who carries a

1014
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,299
gun as a part of their job talking to an

1015
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:11,640
adjunct college professor of guy who

1016
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:13,049
lives in new door he's made a bunch of

1017
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,650
assumptions about me and I did a bunch

1018
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:20,099
of assumptions about him and trying to

1019
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:22,319
say listen he's trying to help you know

1020
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,039
I mean but let's keep let's keep kids

1021
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:33,299
out of jail

1022
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:39,690
let's quit gets to a world that's one

1023
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:41,609
more dashboard okay so similar now it's

1024
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:45,150
sort of watch how this happens I go to

1025
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:47,339
back to dashboard passive DNS this data

1026
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,470
is all coming from Georgia Tech they

1027
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:50,710
have a research program my status with

1028
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,020
Albany allowed me

1029
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,869
to use the impact data request they

1030
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:58,000
share this like malware data with me I

1031
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:00,520
collected all this data and stuffed it

1032
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,940
in here and I do groovy stuff right

1033
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,710
so again Linda's that's where these are

1034
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:09,930
the top 25 domains that they have seen

1035
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:12,670
over the last 30 days right google.com I

1036
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:15,790
really surprise me and then what does

1037
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,930
that mean and what will be with this one

1038
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,580
is really odd to me and I haven't

1039
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,390
actually had time to dig into this this

1040
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,390
is um

1041
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:24,160
you will sympathize with this this is

1042
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,690
all in preparation for the torture that

1043
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,000
I give to the students who take my class

1044
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,790
and fall one of the questions I'm gonna

1045
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,940
make them answer is what exactly is kiss

1046
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:39,400
stock market chicken stop man and why

1047
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,650
why why why it's so much malware going

1048
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,700
through it by the way I didn't even know

1049
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:51,250
top men was a TLD I feel so old

1050
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:52,779
okay so this is just me showing you a

1051
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,910
pie chart because everybody needs pie

1052
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,420
charts in reality regulate copy the deal

1053
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,180
is this

1054
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,690
but listen you can just see you know on

1055
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:04,930
the fourteen fifteen sixteen seven

1056
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,160
you know 19th 20th and 21st if you're

1057
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,930
paying really close attention they're

1058
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,540
gonna notice I have skip in my data I

1059
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:12,580
don't know why they didn't give me a

1060
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,839
data file for these two days and I

1061
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,630
wanted to pause and talk about this just

1062
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,830
for a minute in the real world remember

1063
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,330
I said we have activating or not

1064
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,700
statisticians we're trying to answer

1065
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:22,569
questions in the real world this crap

1066
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,839
happens all the time

1067
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,640
I had a reliable data source for

1068
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:31,359
whatever reason now I have this to date

1069
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:33,460
void where I don't have malady is that

1070
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,980
going to break my research probably not

1071
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,980
because I've designed

1072
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,690
that it doesn't really matter but if I

1073
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,820
was you know doing a job with that

1074
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:44,700
really confused of winning their boss

1075
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:47,130
absolutely so when that kind of stuff

1076
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,379
happens for whatever it's worth shot

1077
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:52,230
mine I don't hide from it and then drive

1078
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:56,970
forward right so I have all my data set

1079
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:58,200
big deal it's real one thing it's how

1080
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,980
people know that you're doing it for

1081
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:14,399
real right if the data is too pretty

1082
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:15,930
you're probably right okay all right so

1083
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,790
this is actually a really interesting

1084
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:21,419
table I wonder posture second just to

1085
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:24,029
show this IP address this 23 to 53 151

1086
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,260
26 left 58 it's super noisy lots of

1087
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,270
malware's getting bounced off this I

1088
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,770
feel all the time what I was then

1089
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:32,040
interested in though as I just yeah but

1090
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:34,259
show me like the top three domains that

1091
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,210
are being hosted on that ID and then all

1092
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,510
the rest just can company together is up

1093
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:42,180
right so that's why you get four rows

1094
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,260
for each idea this this is what I mean

1095
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,850
when I say you have to understand your

1096
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,050
data if you don't understand your data

1097
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,670
you to understand the question you're

1098
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,190
asking this kind of just looks like a

1099
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,760
messed up people right it looks like a

1100
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,960
little weird

1101
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,590
why are there four rows with the same

1102
00:52:51,960 --> 00:53:00,270
idea that the answer is why are there

1103
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:04,050
four rows all struck we need clothes

1104
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:05,970
that calm is happening 4500 times wxd

1105
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,700
analytics that are you this happened

1106
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:15,250
some 108 times c1 on level by n7

1107
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:17,439
nine times and then 64,000 others right

1108
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,600
and I was interested in that because the

1109
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,650
specific question for the students at

1110
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,630
the hall is can we create or even better

1111
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:29,410
yet can we devise a system that

1112
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:32,440
automatically creates classifications

1113
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:35,170
for these IPS the kind that are only

1114
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:38,410
hosting one C two Z's the kind that are

1115
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:40,090
hosting domains that are more you know

1116
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,589
longer in life that happen you know

1117
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,330
thousands and thousands of times that

1118
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:47,910
sort of thing so that's the kind of

1119
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:50,110
thing you can do in a top-end defiers

1120
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,759
similarly I could say the top to be five

1121
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:55,150
from a particular domain happen to be

1122
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,760
five from a particular area of time

1123
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:59,260
whatever I could then grab these nd five

1124
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,920
scripts and I've sold a bunch of other

1125
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,540
things not really a big deal this is

1126
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,970
another example of heat map stuff and

1127
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:11,020
then this is another example of looking

1128
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:12,609
at domains all right so it is 355 in my

1129
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:17,440
defense we didn't get started until

1130
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:22,030
straightaway so apologies to the next

1131
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,300
presenter I'm sure I'll be done in just

1132
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:26,560
a second

1133
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,140
okay so this is me

1134
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,360
I absolutely cheated through these one

1135
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,589
or two parts so if you have extra

1136
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,040
questions or if you're interested in

1137
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:38,950
this at all fantastic and these feel

1138
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:41,980
free to send me an email at work or go

1139
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,390
to the send email at school and I'd be

1140
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,890
