1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:07,140
so so my name is Abby just quick

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:14,040
question like how many of you guys are

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:16,800
students how many you work in IT all

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,529
right and how many of you work like

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,390
solely and security awesome

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,849
scares so like I said my name is adenine

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:33,960
I am the lead of the little friends

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:37,890
incident response team then Castleford -

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,320
years and basically our response is

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,640
somewhat small so we have four and a

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,649
half people that's not someone who's

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:50,190
like torso up but as well and we're

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,280
we're a 24/7 job so it's not uncommon

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:58,589
for me to get called it 3:00 a.m. and be

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,590
a little bit groggy as I am today so so

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,629
like I said we're 24/7 on-call you've

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:10,200
responded to ridiculous amounts of

18
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:14,280
things I think this year return yet was

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,140
that 150 different incidents which which

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,490
is a lot in the grand scheme of things

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,590
was that again somewhat of a small team

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,970
and we've responded to things you know

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,670
HIPAA PCI whatever it is breaches

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,829
internal investigations so 90 guy does

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,189
something badly we figure out what's

26
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,250
going on and figure out what this person

27
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,380
did different different forms of fraud

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,649
and theft Austria 65 compromised how

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,679
many if you can how many do is manage or

30
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,810
use office 365

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,760
keep your hands up how many of those

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:56,030
environments you see

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:59,940
and I know I'm standing everywhere no

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,510
that's ridiculously common and that's

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,070
just a normal infections and infusions

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,990
so this for a woman just for a little

37
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,239
bit of blushy this were a little bit of

38
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:16,859
Statistics so this year 2018 so not

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,810
quite a full year 60% of the incidents

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,360
we see are in New York infectious and

41
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,260
remind you this is just because our

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:31,050
final say in New York 43% are also 60

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:33,000
family so smoking fish everywhere 10%

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,810
result of breaches most those are office

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,510
365 related and 5% ransom or 15 Kristin

46
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,040
our ransomware it's multiple hosts and

47
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,070
something else is going on besides I'm

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,320
just clicking something that they should

49
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,850
8% because of RDP being open to the

50
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,600
Internet and someone having the password

51
00:02:47,850 --> 00:03:00,390
password and 10% are this is just in

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:01,440
2018 10% are eternally related so so

53
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,309
some of the things we've seen in the

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,070
past year

55
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,600
officer 6pi related by the way has

56
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:12,120
anybody here her the ranks we're

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,650
variants Sam Sam yeah so apparently and

58
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,270
I was I was looking around of the

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,670
bridges and I get little to myself for a

60
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,280
while apparently there's a French TV

61
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,040
children's show the main character of it

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,100
and Sam so from now on I'm going to

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,160
refer to that TV show when referring to

64
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,660
ransomware that tends to

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,920
networks see a lot of different malware

66
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,489
the one on the bottom left there's

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,429
pretty interesting and I reading this

68
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,170
lost

69
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:47,680
compromise is really my full-time job

70
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,950
now is the officers about compromises

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:57,489
and then sometimes I get to see cool

72
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:59,828
infections so kind of going into it I'm

73
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,930
gonna give three or four scenarios and

74
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,700
you have time I like to leave a lot of

75
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,269
time at the end because I really like

76
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,768
PowerPoint and presenting too much so

77
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,470
three or four scenarios of different

78
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:14,700
incidents that we've seen this year and

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:19,168
I'll have a couple weird ones at the end

80
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:23,199
so matrix transformer has anybody maybe

81
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:26,500
well so typically our handsome or works

82
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,289
some gets a phishing email they open a

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,570
phishing email and they're like you know

84
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,190
you can't do this content enable macros

85
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,539
and they enable backers and then stuff

86
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,199
gets encrypted and they have to pay

87
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:40,120
Bitcoin or do something typically that

88
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,310
cell works is going to obviously infect

89
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,139
whatever computer is on and possibly

90
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,449
some file shares that that it can access

91
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,740
it's not doing anything too crazy it's

92
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:52,120
pretty unsophisticated matrix trans with

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,430
ransomware works a little bit

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,840
differently so just a quick client

95
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:01,210
clover deal so clients of manufacturing

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,969
of about 200 employees their frequent

97
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,719
flyer meaning that they come to us once

98
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:11,440
every few months and they have a low IQ

99
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,840
budget as appears they make that

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,849
assessment later and they don't have a

101
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,780
screen rats at all so the initial email

102
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:24,729
comes in of course on Friday at 4 p.m.

103
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,880
just saying you know we have an urgent

104
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:32,770
issue they came in through a desktop a

105
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:36,130
lot of our servers and you know can you

106
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,799
help us so so what we initially did in

107
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,870
since we're a consultant you have to

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,470
send different contracts and different

109
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,790
things first so what I tend to do

110
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,420
some information program whether it's

111
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,150
logs or IP addresses or anything like

112
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,430
that just to see where I can help them

113
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:57,469
without actually you know touching their

114
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,630
environment so I found out they're

115
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,000
running the Windows Server 2008 and I

116
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,270
had a lot of ports open that probably

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,100
shouldn't be open I'm guessing you might

118
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,719
be able to guess where this is going

119
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:16,310
they only knew of 80 and 443 that should

120
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,110
have been open and this system was just

121
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,820
on their network and they just opened 80

122
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,260
incorporating to it so if someone were

123
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,670
to get in that assistant they can get to

124
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,840
everything they had a fairly flat

125
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:29,600
network so well winning in the

126
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,239
Steamworks and all other contracts to be

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,250
side I start looking at some logs and I

128
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,870
see that someone already peed into the

129
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:41,410
system from to the administrator and

130
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,210
that was a domain administrator account

131
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,220
so I asked him what's the asserted X I'm

132
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,919
guessing you changed it and it was

133
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,000
nothing you know it was a password it

134
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,280
was actually pretty long which is

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,430
interesting something that won't really

136
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,799
be true before Stover already be and

137
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,229
that's the first thought that came in

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,000
since they didn't really didn't have any

139
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:04,250
login your attention so there's security

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,950
logs and different logs that one would

141
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,890
act like to the day before they didn't

142
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:16,340
you know keep them anywhere else which

143
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:19,070
is always fun so I'm still waiting I see

144
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,890
that you know IP addresses they're

145
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,870
trying to connect over SMP and the first

146
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,130
one I saw was before that I repeat

147
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,390
connection and this was actually a

148
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:32,330
failure I came from the department O'Day

149
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,240
poor tastes in Honduras which roughly

150
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,500
translates to the Department of Courts

151
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,650
which I don't know if that's a city or

152
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,490
not but I thought that was interesting I

153
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,469
don't know if it was like

154
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,680
like the Department of Justice and one

155
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:49,460
of their systems got and can't do that

156
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,819
way but okay and then I saw the first no

157
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:58,219
login which was like a little session

158
00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:04,099
they're anonymous logon and that was

159
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,900
from France so once you probably did

160
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:07,639
engage in my these two images on the

161
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,020
bottom I couldn't actually get images

162
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,680
that didn't have their name splattered

163
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,880
all over it so I just got those online

164
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,770
so so once we actually got the game to

165
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,990
be an issue that I had a feeling that

166
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:23,810
they came in through eternal blue

167
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:27,229
exploit already using eternal blue so so

168
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,750
we scan their external Network and saw

169
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:32,179
that it was vulnerable to to that

170
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,450
specific vulnerability so at least you

171
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,468
know we have a semi good idea of what's

172
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,099
going on now it's just a matter of

173
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:42,589
proving it and then once they got in

174
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,709
they started manually are you peeing too

175
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:49,040
each system and then just clicking on

176
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,689
ransomware net exe and that that's how

177
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,099
they got infected the IT guy there

178
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,310
actually was there while this was

179
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,380
happening and he was he kept this isn't

180
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,569
that they came in to only allowed one

181
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,279
RDP session so he kept kicking them off

182
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,690
you've seen what they're doing and

183
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,250
that's how we were able to get the

184
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:11,329
images which is interesting because I

185
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:14,870
did this at like 9:30 a.m. so the big

186
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:16,729
issue with them is that so we went

187
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,110
outside they're trying to you know help

188
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,399
them figure out what's going on and how

189
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:25,339
I happened that kind of thing and I said

190
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,990
to the guy I was like if this rings more

191
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,430
it brings down your business you can you

192
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,660
can definitely like set what music they

193
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:34,329
had like Windows 95 poppies and

194
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,780
a bunch of like Windows 95 computers I

195
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,230
kind of wanted to take one just just a

196
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:44,530
habit

197
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:50,050
because making that equals Sunday so

198
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:53,829
basically they they installed a firewall

199
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,329
and they thought you know what be

200
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,240
created if I can work on this system

201
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,040
from home so they able they're competing

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,330
they're like I need to get to some file

203
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,390
sharing I don't want to do it over a TV

204
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:12,360
I don't know why so they just enabled

205
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:16,600
everything which which I would recommend

206
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,460
and then you know the system was the

207
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,140
Windows Server 2008 that they just never

208
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:25,060
catch their patches failed so they got

209
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,660
in that way the new therapy to get back

210
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,660
in with the interactive environment and

211
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,330
so incident number two off cc's of fat

212
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:50,220
now there's a few you out there we use

213
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:53,860
obstacies guys did you happen to know

214
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,210
you haven't ever used a API that's just

215
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:02,400
experiment just do well through that GUI

216
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:05,500
okay did you happen to ever hear that

217
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,270
Microsoft Anna and did an API that and

218
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,660
nobody knew except a couple like

219
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:14,620
security terms so so basically if you

220
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,230
ever look through officers these

221
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,210
dialogues are pretty useless or at least

222
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,010
the default locks so they show you what

223
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,330
time they logged in what IP don't show

224
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,710
you log off times which is somewhat

225
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,010
important cuz you want to know how

226
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,660
they're in there you can't see what

227
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,120
messages are be looking Hillary but

228
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,969
attachments reviewed but you know search

229
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,170
breeze around and it only gives you you

230
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:45,010
know beyond that it gives you some

231
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:48,430
session IDs identifiers and so Microsoft

232
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,200
had a API because I think that they

233
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,510
didn't document about but it was open to

234
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,209
everybody and they would actually let

235
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:57,850
you see what attachments messages

236
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:59,770
reviewed what time they reviewed whether

237
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,010
is connected over IMAP or you know

238
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,480
Outlook or just by the web which is

239
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,850
important if the person decided to email

240
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
a bunch of like confidential yeah i ph i

241
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,790
over the arena

242
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,480
does anything see what that they have

243
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:16,089
access to more detailed sessions than

244
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,760
identify our search queries pretty much

245
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:26,620
all the things that i would love to have

246
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:30,040
so in june ish CrowdStrike and some guy

247
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,920
behind a mask decided to to let the

248
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,279
world know that this existed which in my

249
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,050
mind you know shiv already done that but

250
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,610
they need you know we were able to find

251
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,870
out that this exists or they had access

252
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,880
to it so they let the world know and

253
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:50,020
there was a tool up there that you use

254
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,740
that that just lets you get access to

255
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,020
this really awesome information

256
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,040
worried about the attackers taking

257
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:02,790
something so they created a tool

258
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,740
privileges which is pretty neato so you

259
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,740
have the API and you have access to it

260
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,510
you know realistically you're going to

261
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,670
report less breaches you're gonna have

262
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,060
more evidence to report less breaches

263
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:20,550
and you know faucets means we're happy

264
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:22,859
people so what do you guys when this

265
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:28,649
released what do you guys think happened

266
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:31,620
next thing like stuff let it go they

267
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:34,800
shut down access to it and they were

268
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,020
just so ya know it gets access now so

269
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,599
now nobody can access the this data

270
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:44,040
that's critically important and I'm

271
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,760
guessing there might be a few firms out

272
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,349
there I'm actually sure about that so so

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,939
basically now you just tend the base

274
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,649
bottom logs and some stuff within

275
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,420
SharePoint that let's just see what

276
00:13:52,649 --> 00:14:00,660
files review but nothing email related

277
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:03,079
so the client overview for this

278
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:09,420
particular office 365 fishing was

279
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:11,819
college about 2500 students and I was a

280
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,579
he was office 365 they called us saying

281
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,620
that Nigerians are tagging there's about

282
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,390
10 accounts confines didn't have

283
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,220
multi-factor enabled they didn't have

284
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:24,230
anything it was pretty much just the

285
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:27,180
default wherever you get out of the box

286
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,690
and typically how these attacks are

287
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:37,489
going to work is a phishing email comes

288
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:39,960
in they're just spamming everybody so in

289
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,240
their mind there was not too much

290
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:47,970
can do especially being in college

291
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:51,089
because they don't want a nele

292
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,430
multi-vector because it's to a lot of

293
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:57,510
colleges they don't want to because it's

294
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,410
too tiresome I may use it look at the

295
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,750
phone

296
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,439
some people don't have phones they can't

297
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,339
really you know block anywhere because

298
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,860
their students are coming from

299
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:13,140
everywhere so so basically you see a lot

300
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,990
of colleges now who just deal with it as

301
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,240
it comes and they don't actually do

302
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:27,920
anything to try to fix it which is

303
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:32,550
interesting so instead of number three

304
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:36,420
this is a weird one I promised so

305
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:39,180
initial call a fairly large it's all

306
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,209
fine called and they wanted to basically

307
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,649
fire the IT guy because they suspected

308
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:48,510
that he's deluding herself I mean even

309
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:50,520
Pettis to do that so they called us

310
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,620
saying you know come in when you're not

311
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,410
here doing like being the person I was

312
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,120
talking to was being very weird about it

313
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,329
which I suspected that she was in fact

314
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,770
doing something weird about this idea so

315
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,690
you know she's saying you know come when

316
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:11,520
he's not here don't don't let anybody in

317
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:15,839
the company see you but I don't work on

318
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:18,449
weekends just copy the hard drive and

319
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,589
get out of here and she only wants you

320
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,410
know calm the cellphone on her personal

321
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:29,139
cell phone

322
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,969
jaylee five cellphones so we got there

323
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,680
she actually keyless ID badges like

324
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,889
she's very worried someone was gonna

325
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:43,589
figure out I don't think I'm explaining

326
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:43,589
enough like how like what a crazy crazy

327
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,259
yeah sketchy

328
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,029
look she's she's being a very weird

329
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,470
Italian and we were thinking and we had

330
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,810
all the right paperwork in place like

331
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,850
the higher-ups knew that you know this

332
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,199
was happening and you know we have the

333
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,600
lawyers involved and everything and

334
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,279
everybody knew this because of how weird

335
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,959
it was so so basically we went in there

336
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:11,980
quickly just took an image of the

337
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:15,400
Machine and know if it's definitely this

338
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:30,370
way to get you should technically keep

339
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:34,210
access the machine itself yes so what we

340
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:39,239
found we found 10 images on the desktop

341
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,240
that took about seven gigabytes in size

342
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,870
they had Mitchell mismatched headers I

343
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:48,970
will come back to that one he's using

344
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,918
different different browsers he's like

345
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,570
trying to be sneaky about it he was

346
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,470
using Internet Explorer for like normal

347
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,960
work stuff using a social media project

348
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,659
might be against the policy but his

349
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,370
fiery right now bad and in chrome he was

350
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:07,140
doing other things that did not involve

351
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,139
social media or regular work usage

352
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,399
[Laughter]

353
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,730
no no if if we saw anything illegal we

354
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,300
would just immediately shut it down

355
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:41,120
right we don't we don't have the

356
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:45,950
authority to conduct investigations like

357
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,439
that so he also was accessing other

358
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:53,080
people's voicemails and checking their

359
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,370
phones they had some management just

360
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,919
downloading a bunch of data about it and

361
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,010
senior people it was it was actually the

362
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,940
lady wasn't not that parent this guy was

363
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:07,580
he's being reared and you know even on

364
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:11,470
his email account like ever he had

365
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,470
multiple inboxes very lazy

366
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:23,039
I mean I would say it's of these power

367
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:25,899
they think so going back to the files so

368
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,639
so you had piles you know I think mums

369
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:31,629
call Facebook okay with that theater

370
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:34,449
JPEG I'm Tonto that I spelled wrong with

371
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:36,939
that JPEG and other files these are

372
00:19:34,450 --> 00:20:01,960
actually mp4 files in their home videos

373
00:19:36,940 --> 00:20:09,070
now now again like you know yeah yeah so

374
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:12,029
so basically they successfully and then

375
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,029
they were wondering you know

376
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,280
[Music]

377
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,830
so really and this kind of goes with the

378
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,240
statistics I've found while while

379
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,830
writing various reports that we tend to

380
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,000
give this same exact recommendation it's

381
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:34,699
because it's seen as good things happen

382
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,730
and it really comes down to stop

383
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,950
clicking itself so you know give some

384
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,380
sort of awareness not just like

385
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,890
awareness like a boring lecture like

386
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,380
we're having here but like you know

387
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:52,610
engaging some people do like games go to

388
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,400
school and with that it's not allowing

389
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:59,780
users to click on stuff if you can

390
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,790
whether that's as simple as extending

391
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,710
stuff in plain text and emails and using

392
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,550
the safe links and office 365 or

393
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:14,900
whatever it may be or you know lock

394
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:18,500
certain domains means you know you don't

395
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,000
deal with business in Russia or or have

396
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,970
any reason to go to Russian websites

397
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,100
like we did a block you know that Dean

398
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:29,080
argue in various leagues psycho

399
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,780
ammunition the tempo is give is just

400
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,409
after some no bigger actually manage it

401
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,330
and then test it so using whatever you

402
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,750
use whether you know it's messes there's

403
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:48,610
some sort of mobility management tool

404
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:55,570
making sure that and I'm fully aware

405
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:59,439
that this list is like yeah so I would

406
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,659
say 95% of the incidents we see it's

407
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,280
like they just did that one little very

408
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,410
basic thing you know all would have been

409
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,000
avoided

410
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:12,390
please stop without a key to internet

411
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,980
it's not that RTP necessarily as bad

412
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,810
which it said someone's gonna screw up

413
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,510
set any account you know what the

414
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,620
password a password or even in one and

415
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,310
said that we saw before where the

416
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,429
password there was none which actually

417
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,720
that was based on timing of how long

418
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,070
their good reporting versus how long

419
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,810
they actually got him that actually took

420
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:39,040
longer than having a bastard pass before

421
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:45,790
this because I'm guessing the attackers

422
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:49,450
in that case are like actually mesentery

423
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:52,330
oh it was a IT person who's like I want

424
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:56,380
to work from home now I'm gonna just on

425
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:58,629
the far wall at a rule that allows I

426
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,780
repeat my system you forgot you didn't

427
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,780
have a

428
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:09,420
that that costs them some systems that

429
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,420
was that was the same same case they had

430
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:26,830
so stop the RTV if you need pretty much

431
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:31,300
it somehow you know I have like pretty

432
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:35,860
empty do something so when it does if it

433
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:39,870
does get compromised you can pop around

434
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:44,050
because other systems which we never see

435
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,639
having that in place and then really

436
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:52,389
just asking yourself questions like do

437
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:54,250
we care about India or do do people from

438
00:23:52,390 --> 00:24:02,140
Louisiana the access you know our

439
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:03,760
stuffing if it's no one ever you don't

440
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,650
even access from a country or to the

441
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:24,660
country and a lot of the services like

442
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:36,429
email and other stuff is again for

443
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:40,559
colleges which makes college makes a lot

444
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:40,559
harder to help

445
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,530
no we can't get a bunch of students over

446
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,530
here we actually have a place out and

447
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,730
you know whatever may be ready attacking

448
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,129
and so they can't really block that

449
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,809
maybe we can you don't want to enable

450
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,920
multi pack there because it kind of

451
00:24:53,809 --> 00:25:00,920
kills everybody at least they're moving

452
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,640
so really trying the toughest part is

453
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:07,850
doing security and the you know managing

454
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,940
you have user experience so you know

455
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:22,639
best way to be secure shut down like

456
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:24,860
we're done but and then finally you know

457
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,470
risk management no no what you horrible

458
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:31,129
with you know is you're vulnerable to

459
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:34,820
and our chasm what's most important to

460
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:48,590
us given a you know five billion dollar

461
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:52,639
asset it's just and then finally have a

462
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:55,250
response plan test the plan you know go

463
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,470
through scenarios you can see where the

464
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:01,250
gaps are in the plan and trying to fix

465
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:05,090
the plan and actually like use it in an

466
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:07,370
incident a lot of people will just do

467
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,220
what they think is right which a lot of

468
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,090
times it's actually not that far off but

469
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:20,630
when it is office like really off the

470
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:22,790
other client ones who had a adware

471
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,650
Malwarebytes popped up yet and we're on

472
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:28,540
this versus computer so they actually

473
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:30,620
went to the server just unplugging stuff

474
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,889
because they thought like they were done

475
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,889
with

476
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,169
so when we tell them yes only on this

477
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,750
one computer in its nine like really

478
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:45,660
like a bad infection or snack now you

479
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:51,480
know if you consider it infection they

480
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:54,240
are less than happy with the IT folks so

481
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,200
that that is all I have and I kind of

482
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
intentionally kept it short

483
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,020
yes

484
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,470
[Music]

485
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:58,799
so yes no so so people with their this

486
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:07,799
meaningly just reinstalling Windows

487
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:09,629
Server and they were they didn't have

488
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,600
images and it hasn't anything to

489
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,159
actually help actually when we're on

490
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,110
site they're like you know we shut down

491
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,269
one of the systems it won't come back up

492
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,269
that was what Windows 2000 great system

493
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:29,340
my bet actually been like two thousand

494
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,230
something else but there was certain

495
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,590
loaders ever encrypted as well so

496
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:37,590
Olympic backup and like I said you know

497
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,689
we need a to recover those files just to

498
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,379
put the system back that we need these

499
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,760
specific fellows from the setup disk and

500
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,260
that's when we went digging around and

501
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,190
looking for the set up disk it's all

502
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:55,070
windows 95 floppies the I don't know if

503
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,070
you guys remember like the old word CDs

504
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,750
yeah they had a whole closetful of lobby

505
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:09,570
disks and so they they had nothing I

506
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:12,809
would say generally speaking 30% of our

507
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,269
clients don't nothing

508
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:18,960
and really when they have an incident

509
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:20,789
that's a come-to-jesus moment where

510
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,020
where they increase I keep I did they

511
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:26,770
actually like make the security program

512
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,000
like and they actually like to start you

513
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,490
know caring a little bit more and then

514
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,940
we just you know you won't hear from

515
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,910
them again

516
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,500
some of our clients will do mix it in

517
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,150
then they just drop off the face of the

518
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:42,670
earth as they don't want to talk to me

519
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:59,580
and and then they'll have another one in

520
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:59,580
six months you call us so yes

521
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,010
kind of subject but yeah when you have

522
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,930
an engagement like that what kind of

523
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,830
process you go through

524
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,830
that person actually

525
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:29,339
yeah so so firstly it has to be there

526
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,049
are certain things that have to go check

527
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:34,109
the box for us to even try to do

528
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:36,269
something like this one you know being

529
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:38,879
has to be a system owned by the

530
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:41,329
organization I can't be a personal

531
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:44,908
system you can't even if they have in

532
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:46,469
there we're not taking we tend to be

533
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:51,409
extremely careful when those situations

534
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:56,039
come up just because it's very sketchy

535
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:58,049
so so we will typically you know make

536
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,969
sure that the system's owned by them and

537
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:04,379
every all the components are owned by

538
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:06,809
the organization and then we will you

539
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:09,329
know get in contact with their lawyer or

540
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:10,729
bring a lawyer to make sure that

541
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:14,158
everything is good to go

542
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:19,200
and then we will do the sketchy stuff

543
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:24,049
and sneaking through their events I'm

544
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,609
not stating appearance but but yeah so

545
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,200
in those situations over there they

546
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:31,708
don't really come up that often I

547
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,389
probably before this last one I probably

548
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:36,959
haven't seen in a couple years maybe

549
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:39,958
three years they're pretty rare I think

550
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:41,530
that's just because the organization's

551
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:44,720
get that

552
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,250
policies and have processes otherwise

553
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,630
they're screwed at some point where they

554
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,880
already did get you in there we should

555
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:56,600
probably have this we saw a guy who was

556
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,310
getting sued by his organization and

557
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,740
they because he's accessing the system

558
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:04,909
didn't have a password or anything in it

559
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:08,390
they didn't have a learning things and

560
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:12,440
leave not aware but I believe that's

561
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:15,290
actually reason ie by the cases dropped

562
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:25,660
so like this simple little processes

563
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:25,659
policies organization or just

564
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:46,040
yeah yeah yeah so if there's a any

565
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:51,490
chance of British Kirk say anything was

566
00:32:46,040 --> 00:33:15,590
even touch that hospital whatever baby

567
00:32:51,490 --> 00:33:28,610
we're going to strongly recommend pretty

568
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:30,500
much answered my question yeah yeah so

569
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,179
so when in the incident when an action

570
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:37,370
instead comes up we're going to

571
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,190
formulate a team both on our end there

572
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:43,939
and so we're gonna have who's important

573
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:48,890
not all the c-suite you know you know

574
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:51,920
chief marketing person human resources

575
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:57,650
will be potentially their CEO if they

576
00:33:51,920 --> 00:34:01,370
don't have a seat oh you know any legal

577
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:05,880
HR things like that will be involved as

578
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:10,029
well as ITC IOC is over

579
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,919
and that that's kind of the command team

580
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,169
I guess I'll call it and then you know

581
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,750
I'm working a lot with the IT people who

582
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:21,940
can you know know their environment

583
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:25,360
I'm not just in your stuff if it's if

584
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:29,649
it's a situation like like the IT guy

585
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:33,270
there and nobody knows it's only going

586
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:43,810
to be CEO and square the contact is

587
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:45,429
there's many people that know so if your

588
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,489
computer is ever on then it just

589
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:54,100
suddenly is off you know about what you

590
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:58,540
did that's the only thing we could do is

591
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:02,940
keep it on let me yeah like esteana so

592
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,940
much quicker but yeah

593
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:28,060
yes actually listen to one speaker who

594
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:30,100
said that he said that rather than the

595
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,720
IT team pulling out cables and stuff

596
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:37,150
when they think of affection has

597
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,339
occurred number they actually will let

598
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:52,900
them have a network actually allow them

599
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:54,730
to see if they yeah so you said I didn't

600
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,970
hear whispers federal government soon

601
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:03,750
yeah yeah so that's that's a common

602
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:06,220
tactic they'll let things run and let go

603
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,650
we will only do that and we have

604
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,169
information nowhere and we need to see

605
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:14,440
what they're doing but in reality our

606
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,820
number one goal is to get a client up

607
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,590
and running as quick as possible to

608
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,040
recover from them just get that cup in

609
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:23,860
writing as well as bigger glass it's

610
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,300
like they decided the future and but

611
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,710
really it comes down to quickly figuring

612
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,990
out what happened what may have been

613
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,180
affected so if there is a chance I

614
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:39,490
didn't touch thi and then it gets to do

615
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:43,020
a longer process or whatever maybe but

616
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:47,649
then you know for instance the the

617
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:49,600
Windows 95 people there they didn't

618
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:54,970
around the system said system to

619
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,440
attempted to be hit so you know it's

620
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,299
just a matter of finger on what happened

621
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,010
so it doesn't keep happening and then

622
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:05,830
just get things but no we typically

623
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:08,620
won't keep things just right on the

624
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:11,230
network unless it's absolutely Congress

625
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,670
unnecessary because you know if they're

626
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,260
actually inside your network it's not

627
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,720
just an automation program they can get

628
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,300
to you know anything making it to you

629
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,669
know it's a hospital give to your EMR

630
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:25,270
whatever may be so we just wanted to

631
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:28,300
stop it assuming that it isn't something

632
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,670
that we can't figure out so if for

633
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:37,240
instance ransomware if there are certain

634
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:44,470
traces that this is the same standards I

635
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:50,430
don't think these but you know if it's

636
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:50,430
we know that piece of metal is brand new

637
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:04,790
that one that that was that actually

638
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:08,210
came to us it was a previous client you

639
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:10,700
know they got a federal agency and they

640
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:13,400
actually initially they actually turned

641
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:19,879
away like you hear that and it actually

642
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:23,450
was a federal agency and that one was

643
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,040
basically they they were sending word I

644
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:31,899
mentioned dog acts but they loaded a

645
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:34,279
template file from a Netherlands penis

646
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,880
so they neck he said there was just

647
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,660
nothing so we actually arrived in a

648
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,660
controlled environment

649
00:38:51,920 --> 00:39:00,030
yes some of the costs associated with

650
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:03,540
someone appreciates a breaching it's

651
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:09,080
it's there's a lot so typically a breach

652
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,080
will cost a company about $20 per person

653
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,830
[Music]

654
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,010
so you know if you have a hundred

655
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:26,580
thousand person breaching it's pretty

656
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:29,550
expensive for the only actual legal

657
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:33,509
investigation is it's not ridiculous

658
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:35,240
amount on average between legal and you

659
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:43,680
know if you do have someone come in

660
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:46,770
probably do so it's not ridiculously

661
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,020
expensive if you compare it to you know

662
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:50,310
a massive like breach that's that's

663
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,060
really where you're going to get hit

664
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:57,090
pretty good and then office 365 those

665
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,220
specific compromise environment where

666
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:06,950
you know there before it reaches can get

667
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:09,810
pretty expensive to only because report

668
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,460
and in that case you don't know what

669
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,490
they accessed so you have to report

670
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:19,820
every single person has an email account

671
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:19,819
or any email accounts so that that's

672
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,500
but typically the most expensive

673
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,050
creatures will be when you don't know

674
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,670
who's affected so in a hospital scenario

675
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,830
if Branson markets and you can't

676
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:34,910
absolutely disapprove that it didn't

677
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:36,110
isolate data and you know your EMR was

678
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:38,779
hit something like that

679
00:40:36,110 --> 00:41:00,730
you report that everybody who is in IDNR

680
00:40:38,780 --> 00:41:00,730
which yes

681
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:20,880
only whip do this stuff if it's just a

682
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:23,790
simple like right now common law

683
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,770
enforcement but if it's you know like

684
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,330
one of the Sam Sann with nature says it

685
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,120
flowing everywhere

686
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:34,590
law enforcement's going to be involved

687
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:37,410
of course myths involved anything

688
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:40,050
anything beyond the basics typically

689
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,609
what we'll do is we'll say do you want

690
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:45,090
law enforcement you know involved there

691
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:47,790
it will help track down who did this and

692
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:50,100
it helps their statistics a lot if it's

693
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,740
big enough

694
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,569
typically love law enforcement what I'm

695
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,339
doing in these cases that we deal with

696
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:00,720
they won't actually do the investigation

697
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:02,820
through the analysis unless it's

698
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,350
something like that one works brand-new

699
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:10,710
yet they don't even know what's going on

700
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:14,940
but they see it happen rarely

701
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:18,120
state-level usually most of the time

702
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:22,260
this FBI that were engaging sometimes if

703
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:24,660
it's related to fraud credit card fraud

704
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,460
is gonna be Secret Service

705
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,660
very rarely do we reach out to

706
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:34,200
Department of Homeland Security is

707
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:38,310
mostly FBI the CR service yeah I Secret

708
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:41,460
Service in addition to protective chump

709
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:47,210
will will they deal with counterfeit

710
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:51,290
light so when credit card cross one

711
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,290
secret serve that secret services

712
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,980
let me pull the line I just think I know

713
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,979
it
