00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:22,859
hello sorry I think you distribute so my

2
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,710
actions opinions are not a reflection of

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,660
my former employer the tools and

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,820
knowledge about to be given to you or

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,040
educational purposes only and I

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,110
responsible in any way for the way you

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,410
use the information and tools given to

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:44,390
you

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:47,879
so Hickock goods so my hunky mother I

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,500
was the founder of the Cisco ninjas the

11
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,360
implements were ready into about five

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,399
million by all bombers was a group that

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,320
we created but we were learning binary

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,770
exploitation some of the same members

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,379
from Cisco ninjas were in their DARPA I

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,920
know that I currently run all the

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,920
dangerous

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,970
dangerous product I'll answer talk of

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,490
ninjas was a telephone freaking group

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:27,690
that I belong to we break into voicemail

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:31,320
systems you ccitt vulnerability and the

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:35,610
dope house mentions awesome inches they

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,820
didn't pick all the names interests they

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,440
finished research project Alliance a

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,660
group of people that are cable and get

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,630
together and build on projects and break

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,429
into lots of things we do it on a

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:02:01,890
private network we companies are

29
00:01:47,430 --> 00:02:05,490
normally laces there's no way to say so

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:09,959
by you give me 30 million vulnerable

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,790
devices honeypot gathering you can do

32
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,790
port forwarding so port forward all the

33
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,890
port 80s dear host emulate web

34
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,859
applications find the latest on our

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,010

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,350
man-in-the-middle attacks using the UPnP

37
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,870
I can change the DNS on your router play

38
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,060
man in the middle attacks and make apple

39
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,100
result in my web server is by the

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,830
exploitation cuts against your networks

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:40,440
users port scanning internal hosts so

42
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,360
this is where we add an external port

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,850
that points to an internal India did IP

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,200
address I can bypass your name firewall

45
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,060
authentication who doesn't exist for

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,959
this vertical I'm not breaking the wall

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
unless I make a modification to it and

48
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,420
SSDP

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,369
dr. das so previously there was a

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,530
distributor reflective analysis stack

51
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:07,709
burn upp and you would get about 300

52
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,370
Kelvin reflection of attack I found a

53
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,420
way to amplify it by 200

54
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,040
four times it makes it the largest

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,589
district here electric denial service

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,459
attack today the previous one that I

57
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,340
found was an SMP fault walk where you

58
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:29,069
can ask the base of every everything on

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,069
the SNMP this is much more significant

60
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,569
so you can't be punch holes of name what

61
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,720
you're doing is through soap request to

62
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:47,380
the UPP server using my tools you can

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,349
set the board's scheme internal hosts

64
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,530
see if they have Bonner abilities and

65
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,690
penetrate them very straightforward it

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,079
also has a side effect of sometimes with

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,930
older versions of many UPnP d you can

68
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,329
point to an external host an external

69
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,540
for some time i can use your router go

70
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,010
bounce IRC or the cisco and make you

71
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,709
attributable for my actions

72
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,060
luckily it doesn't block any actions

73
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,400
that are made against the you can be

74
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:20,380
serviced so good luck figuring out it

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:27,280
was me choose my xbox warm pints media

76
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:29,229
servers devices in your house as a twin

77
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
brother called make campy made by apple

78
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,389
the exact same vulnerability just a

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:43,229
different profile i didn't build tools

80
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:50,970
for that top countries with it open

81
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:53,710
we have china 600,000 250,000 and so on

82
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,080
the way up design my tools will unique I

83
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,900
scanned the antenna I broke down every

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,729
IP address by country and data based it

85
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,919
so if you want to change all the TMS in

86
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:05,340
Russia

87
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,340
just don't blame me

88
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:23,560
so here's our tool to download it

89
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,120
afterward that's various functionality

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,820
but we're going to show up pulling

91
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,220
usernames great find this so that might

92
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:36,159
talk to failure you'll see here where

93
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,300
I'm doing a get username request and I'm

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,300
doing set DNS against three-pound posts

95
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,180
or IP addresses but I know we'll be

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,770
successful for the talk but within the

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,169
directory you're gonna find 30 million

98
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,690
vulnerable IP addresses from my country

99
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,240
like I had said these are the usernames

100
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,039
to login to the devices which is great

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,100
to be able to get a username but I'm

102
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,229
capable of setting username as well as

103
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,490
setting a password downloading the

104
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,940
configuration to get the original

105
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,940
password

106
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:34,550
the countries are broken down into the

107
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,800
two-letter country code so we have

108
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,800
Russia China all the major players

109
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:05,219
so UPnP works over UDP protocol for 1978

110
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,020
a UPnP and search against a multicast

111
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
address internally on network will give

112
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,919
you results but a lot of product

113
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,560
manufacturers and made it available on

114
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,560
the land side in that way we're able to

115
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,240
see on the mama I didn't actually expect

116
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,720
to get results on this one kind of

117
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:27,389
surprised why it's interesting is even

118
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,139
if you turn to you pinky off it doesn't

119
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,120
turn off it turns off the UDP service

120
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:42,300
that tells you where to get these

121
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:43,470
variants where get the control ports but

122
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,330
if you already know where the control

123
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,780
ports that are run on a TCP service

124
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,780
exists

125
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,749
if you are going to wear the control

126
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,239
cord exists in the XML file name for the

127
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,189
silk request it doesn't tend to close

128
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:11,369
the TCP port so you can still control

129
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:13,589
the UPnP my second tool goes in the text

130
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:15,059
that vector so you want to keep disabled

131
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:19,050
you can pee on your home router you're

132
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:21,599
likely so vulnerable here you can see it

133
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,550
pulling up the XML files these are the

134
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,610
action scripts telling you how to behave

135
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,309
with the soap service this is the TCP

136
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,989
port there's about 40 ports in total the

137
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,079
different device issues they think that

138
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:37,399
obfuscation will help them prevent the

139
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,399
same across all of the devices

140
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,470
so simple service discovery protocol the

141

IgD your internet gateway device this is

144
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:05,259
your home routers and open connectivity

145
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,079
is where you can find all the protocols

146
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:10,239
specifications it's not limited to this

147
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:14,888

157
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:51,129
tells you what services are available on

158
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:57,129
the network it runs over HTTP you which

159

is HTTP over UDP UDP 1900 always for

160
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:04,079
this vulnerable and open landside which

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,999
it usually is requires no authentication

music player it's public knowledge

169
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:29,799
there's public exploits for Don exploit

170
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:33,758
DB or exploit DV and the reflection

171
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:37,629
attack from 2015 so if I send an SSD P

172
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,660
robust to your upp service the spoofed

173
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:43,679
IP addresses the GDP will respond but

174
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,299
the services offered on your network

175
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,769
problem with that is that I can tell

176
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:49,620
that the services that are offered on

177
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,630
your network I can't stop it

178
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,260
254 different places they're thinking

179
00:10:52,630 --> 00:11:00,900
you're on gimpy vert responded so I can

180
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:04,600
amplify your payload this is what a

181
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:07,030
gateway device request looks like it's

182
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,060
pretty generic if you set your time to

183
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:13,270
wait a little higher you can make all

184
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,280
the devices if you set it higher and

185
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,590
then increment downward is you hit your

186
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,569
glutes us with your request you can make

187
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,270
all the devices hit the remote target at

188
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,140
the exact same time which further

189
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:33,250
amplifies the attack seasons now

190
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:36,069
time-based attack as well so SSDP

191
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:39,430
distribute reflective denial service UDP

192
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,990
protocols can you all know this spoofer

193
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,060
customer target site being their receive

194
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,910
the response responsible for 50 gigabit

195
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,969
attack per second its Akamai that was

196
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,540
the old technique it would be times 254

197
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,540
with mine

198
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:05,720
you can add the amplification SSDP

199
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:08,810
reflection attack you ppsspp notify can

200
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,570
be used to add services for up to 1800

201
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,959
seconds so you have several minutes that

202
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,070
you can build up your amplification list

203
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:25,390
before it all hits your target at the

204
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:28,610
same time and like the notify statement

205
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,910
new generic the location is what matters

206
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,750
this right here the reason it matters is

207
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,010
if you close off the UDP upp service if

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,110
you already know with that location

209
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,530
existing phenomena the devices you can

210
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:48,530
test the device to see if it still has

211
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:51,439
wishes so you don't fun you PMP actions

212
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:54,230
I can delete your DNS server I can set

213
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,870
it as I show you with my previous demo I

214
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,040
can add the port mapping that allows me

215
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,740
to bypass your name firewall leave the

216
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,959
port mapping sorry force the termination

217
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,080
on the device so if I wanted to knock

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,760
out all the affective memory devices in

219
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,770
Russia I just do forth from nation level

220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,210
setting all the disconnect time so maybe

221
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,090
I don't want to do it for a while than

222
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,710
one set it to do it tomorrow so that

223
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,700
there's any chance of anything being

224
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:27,500
left behind by the high-speed it's gone

225
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,390
suddenly I will disconnect time delete

226
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,910
the access point settings and I can no

227
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,060
longer connect your Wi-Fi network or a

228
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:40,790
boot device which is handy when you're

229
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:43,069
modifying firmware so action so when you

230
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,349
received XML file from the idæan changes

231
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,600
and you can view request because you are

232
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,370
about to get the XML file and it

233
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,030
responds to you with actions the soap

234
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,030
server a lot

235
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,270
or setting the DNS server and remote

236
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:04,020
server this long as you're sending this

237
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:06,540
within your itch to be post request you

238
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,949
can make the change I have another tool

239
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,449
that I'll be showing you that allows you

240
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,680
to do all the different actions even if

241
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,360
I haven't seen it before

242
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,170
because it breaks them down into

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,240
categories in the past

244
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,439
DNS man-in-the-middle by changing the

245
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,149
DNS second ordered you to my web server

246
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,980
rather than the place you're looking to

247
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:34,010
go use something like the interpreter to

248
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,010
do a browser-based exploit get

249
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:47,149
JavaScript injection as possible so I

250
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:47,149
can access us you have been getting a

251
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,500
tour boarding so there's several things

252
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,529
you have to set within the action file

253
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,959
to do the port forwarding if give the

254
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,730
new remote host which is actually the

255
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,430
internally did I be here the external IP

256
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,959
you want it to point to the new external

257
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,719
port at the port that it's connecting to

258
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,680
so if I want to connect you to CNN an

259
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,430
FTP or a tier 4 4 3 to the forward via

260
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,290
protocol I have to define TCP or UDP new

261
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:20,370
internal port this is the port that I'm

262
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:26,490
going to be connecting to your router

263
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:28,770
with internal client is the IP address

264
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,920
of your LAN device or external IP

265
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,870
address whether I want to enable them

266
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,709
which I don't know what they would set

267
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,020
that the port mapping description so we

268
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,869
can have a brief description a lot of

269
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,910
the UPnP servers have proto flourishes

270
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,850
in string format issues within this

271
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,059
setting and the lease duration which you

272
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:56,049
can set

273
00:15:49,059 --> 00:16:00,218
zero many UPnP limits on port forward so

274
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:01,869
you can be was identified as having all

275
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:03,759
these issues that were with newer

276
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,509
versions they started restricting what

277
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,189
you could do

278
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,989
so it's just no longer pointing and an

279
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:10,118
external IP address with a newer device

280
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:13,269
and also the port ranges that you are

281
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:26,859
allowed to actually or forward to these

282
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:36,159
are the limitations some limitations

283
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:37,899
allow you to forward and you can port it

284
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,899
to the external IP to bypass its

285
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:44,559
configuration it also works on port 80

286
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:56,519
sometimes people I will hire in the

287
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:58,718
reports device as its using IP router

288
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,299
you can port scan an internal network

289
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:06,909
from you BMP exploit vulnerable services

290
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:10,240
again such as file-sharing upgrading the

291
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:13,559
firmware you can grab the firmware off

292
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,868
of the router manufacturers website

293
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,849
decompress it back work with your own

294
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:20,829
username and password or services

295
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:24,009
compile whatever you want to that

296
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,559
particular architecture recompile it and

297
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:29,259
upload it to the vise by exploiting the

298
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:35,970
UPnP since you can log in the device you

299
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:42,240
can update the firmware so popular

300
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:45,270
a long time it's over some databases set

301
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,210
username and password this allows us to

302
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,668
get numbers routing device itself pretty

303
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,760
straightforward you just for doing the

304
00:17:50,669 --> 00:18:06,500
grunt work back doing the leaves no log

305
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:06,500
for them the menu can be disabled you

306
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,460
need to Sable that you need be service

307
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,399
the TCP service that's actually the

308
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:19,890
control port is usually still on most

309
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:22,250
devices so SSDP returns a service

310
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,870
located on the HP server

311
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:28,500
these are TCP services that we know that

312
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,389
makes it work if you scan the TCP ports

313
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,789
themselves we know they control port

314
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,460
would be on and look for that XML file

315
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:38,070
we're able to get the actions they're

316
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:44,549
capable in the device so you PP doesn't

317
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:56,789
really need the service you can see

318
00:18:44,549 --> 00:19:00,450
sanctions voice beyond the target 250

319
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:03,590
threads identify supports TCP ports not

320
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:07,549
to control the remote device expert on

321
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:11,220
SCA peas which are the control points or

322
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:15,440
control devices generates the soap

323
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,440
action request which will be a text file

324
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,010
so here's that tool that's not as

325
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,010
descriptive as the previous

326
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,900
[Music]

327
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,549
so circuit TCP ports can for about

328
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:24,080
fourteen TCP ports I've identified in

329
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:25,668
the past is wrong the service and it's

330
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,519
looking for the XML files that it seen

331
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:32,769
on various devices in the past to see if

332
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,769
it can identify any quick

333
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,539
[Music]

334
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:21,899
so these are the TCP ports those looking

335
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:23,880
for and as I scroll down you can see all

336
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,650
the different folders in XML posits

337
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,120
looking for on those various ports so

338
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,520
just because port 80 's open doesn't

339
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:35,310
mean but it doesn't look for five to ten

340
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,810
different services running as you can

341
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,580
see here some of the output shows the

342
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,600
functionality that you can do with this

343
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:48,169
device I get info DHCP server

344
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,169
configuration get DMS sub DMS

345
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,139
so breaks down based on the IP address

346
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:12,429
on four and then based upon the URL for

347
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,240
each individual service we'll look at

348
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,240
the land of ice

349
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,559
so each individual action even if I

350
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,940
haven't seen device before is available

351
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:18,059
yes which you wouldn't find another

352
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,059
tools you were just drunk yet

353
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:58,700
and the response will show that he must

354
00:23:52,519 --> 00:24:02,320
server running there's yeah this was one

355
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,820
of home coaching she's in Google DNS now

356
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,759
but it allows you to do all the actions

357
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:11,389
available to any of the different

358
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:15,499
devices configured within the UPP

359
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:17,719
service and it allows you to do it again

360
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:21,039
still even if it's disabled UPnP and the

361
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,039
remote devices web panel

362
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:37,149
so coming out on IRC dr. Pinette org and

363
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,940
we'll build things together since I have

364
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:41,289
a half an hour top and an hour to fill

365
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,830
it in and I want to show some of the

366
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:46,090
other fun things that are gonna work out

367
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,090
more recently than this
