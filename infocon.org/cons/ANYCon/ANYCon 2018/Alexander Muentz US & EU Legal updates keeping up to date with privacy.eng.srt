1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:08,309
this is a law top-most so I apologize if

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,960
I or you at any time it's natural it's

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,879
you know I thought years a postgraduate

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,130
education and boring people and being a

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,710
pain in the ass just a guy I know that

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,279
know the audience anyone here in

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:28,460
compliance good we'll watch it about

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:35,460
that straight ITV not security

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:37,500
all security awesome okay because no

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,440
lawyer there's Oh every talk starts with

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,469
the disclaimer so I am a lawyer not a

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,379
lawyer I'm a consultant and I can be

13
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,640
your consultant I you know I'm easily

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:55,468
bribed many of these laws are new which

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,600
is code for I'm pretty I'm making some

16
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,809
guesses as to what they actually are

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,820
going to need like a fifty year old law

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,269
has fifty years of precedent and we know

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,670
what each of the words means and we get

20
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:12,350
detailed detailed findings on their

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,140
statute where no one's interpreted we're

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,899
making educated guesses are as I like to

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,259
say it until I'm wearing black robes my

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,180
opinions don't have much more cuz I talk

25
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,570
a lot of people who are lawyers well I

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,829
this is what it means like really what

27
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,529
what court of appeals that you sitting

28
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,039
on until then like your opinion is as

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,990
valuable as mine and I spend a fair

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,170
amount of time front and drink with

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:45,419
regulators and people work for various

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,520
agencies that may enforce these to get

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,470
like what do you think it means what are

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,479
you going to wear your directions going

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,710
to be to get some idea and of course

36
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,770
because I'm drinking with them the

37
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,880
recollections are often fuzzy so I have

38
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,729
been wrong before

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,539
I'm on paper as saying that the idea of

40
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,180
the iTunes selling

41
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,100
television shows was the stupidest idea

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,450
I've ever heard and well what I am wrong

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,130
not speaking for my clients or my

44
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:23,450
employer if I still have one of the it

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:26,060
 okay why why is the regulation most

46
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,859
of these laws attempt to fix problems

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,780
that we have recognized right sometimes

48
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,570
there are also a way of working out a

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,780
fundamental disagreement about what the

50
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,840
internet is for like how are we supposed

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,900
to live on it right because like privacy

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,880
we all like privacy but also you are a

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,250
product right those are two conflicting

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,190
views and that's mostly like my rant

55
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,160
about not really my brand a way of

56
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,150
explaining European views about privacy

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,320
and the gdpr

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,850
versus say the American view okay we

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,140
want to collect a lot of information

60
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,980
about you we are meta information

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,230
because that's the product if you're not

62
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,880
paying for it you're the product versus

63
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,530
the European view which is like no we're

64
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,140
like you you're not a product you're a

65
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,110
person and your relationship with

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,070
Facebook or Twitter or Google is

67
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:25,549
different so free flow of information

68
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,980
versus criminal facilitation right is

69
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,459
there okay to do anything on the

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,640
Internet

71
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,920
sometimes they flow of information is

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,570
facilitating criminal enterprises and we

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,059
can take a view that's like well it's

74
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,329
internet just speech versus you know

75
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,310
your website is anneka you to making the

76
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,780
world a more efficient place for your

77
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,930
criminal market like facilitation of

78
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,250
drug sales facilitation of legal firearm

79
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,690
sales facilitation of prostitution right

80
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,670
and we have to kind of we figure out

81
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,239
where the lines are and well these laws

82
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,369
are attempts to make that habit so one

83
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,480
theme I kind of wanna I want to work on

84
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:11,269
is regulation isn't camp

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,129
Fix market failure right we have

86
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,250
generally a free flow of information

87
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:22,789
open marketplace of information but

88
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:24,560
sometimes we recognize that a service

89
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,160
we're offering on the Internet are a

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,560
business model is flawed for example

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,120
like King Equifax as an example there is

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:39,440
a large externality to Equifax its

93
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,229
business model you cannot opt out right

94
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,150
because you're not actually a customer

95
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,729
you're not you are a set you're a

96
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,429
product the people you do business with

97
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,169
send information to Equifax and when

98
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,199
they got breached and dumped all that

99
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:56,840
infos like well you have you know who

100
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,180
are you in this contract you have

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,409
nothing so there's the many of these

102
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,210
laws are attempt to bring some equity

103
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,300
back to them equity back to the

104
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,560
relationship so we also have a problem

105
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:17,200
of asymmetric information how can you

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,460
identify the risk you're taking in

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,050
adopting a video entering your

108
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,419
information doing the social network are

109
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:31,220
developing your business partner it's

110
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:33,250
difficult you have to assess how much

111
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,330
damage they can do to your life and

112
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,760
sometimes you have no idea

113
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:43,760
like who here knew who he knew about

114
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:45,770
Equifax --is so at a she struts problem

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,560
until it until it showed up on crest

116
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,380
right no one's like did they did a pen

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,990
test against Equifax to figure out if

118
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,919
there were list to them or not Equifax

119
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,560
didn't so risk management is a business

120
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,729
decision if you think of you the leaders

121
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,270
of the business especially a large

122
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:07,729
organization there are generally

123
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,469
generalists they think about all the

124
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,070
things that they have to do to keep the

125
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,539
business moving forward operating

126
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,840
surviving and changing marketplace and

127
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:19,039
our little niche cybersecurity is just

128
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,429
one of the many

129
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,160
many risks that they're looking at like

130
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,290
and I want to give the idea of well

131
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,570
understood versus incoming risks about

132
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,240
this for example I'm thinking of a kind

133
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,690
of mind that there's a software

134
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,360
manufacturer that essentially works in

135
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:42,469
the SHP environment and if you've ever

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,810
touched that same PD I'm sorry SP isn't

137
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,810
so much a product as it is a

138
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:54,140
relationship for life you don't roll STP

139
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,719
quickly and if you're a in that

140
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,090
ecosystem generally your contracts are

141
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,160
long-lived because an SI p rollout us a

142
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,880
long time an SI p installation lives a

143
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,080
long time

144
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,810
it's quarter business and I was privy to

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,370
be helping them work out dangerous

146
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,730
strategy problems and they recognize

147
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,040
they to risks in 2017 one was

148
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,740
fluctuating most they're an American

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,620
company most of the business was in

150
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:26,960
Europe and because it's a competitive

151
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:30,620
marketplace their contracts were of thin

152
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,190
margin they had a lot of extensive

153
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,530
people they had to hire two to provide

154
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,150
their service and fluctuation between

155
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,669
the US dollar because they came to

156
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,710
developers of US dollars they however

157
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,620
their contracts were with European

158
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,359
companies so they're built in Europe and

159
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,530
if the euro fluctuates in the wrong

160
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,930
direction a profitable contract becomes

161
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,150
unprofitable the other was cycle like

162
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,670
what do we do at the silence earn and

163
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,530
the problem was is that I'm pitching

164
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,660
what they need to do what controls you

165
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,299
need to put in place how they need to do

166
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,870
these things and the probably run into

167
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,580
is the financial people were like able

168
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,930
to come out with a really really nice

169
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,550
tight model about where the euro dollar

170
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,080
relationship was likely going to it's

171
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,060
going to fluctuate but there's tight

172
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,909
bands and they can they can hedge for

173
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,440
that risk and when I talk about how much

174
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,260
had to spend versus I was like well if

175
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,569
we spend more money how much do we save

176
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,909
the risk I'm like

177
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,490
I can tell you a number but it's going

178
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:36,799
to be a lie what if we spend less money

179
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,810
your risk goes up help but what does

180
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:44,569
that do to our bottom line of life it

181
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,989
would be bad if he got breach how's that

182
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:50,410
like honestly I cannot give you I can

183
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,610
say that if you don't do a code review

184
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,740
you increase the risk of learner

185
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,470
abilities that will cause a problem in

186
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,190
the future but I can't be as specific as

187
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:03,230
the person who says with a 95% accurate

188
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,509
model that were predicted the Euro and

189
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,399
Europe our relationship would be here so

190
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,529
any contract over this number will be

191
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,100
profitable any contract must match the

192
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:15,649
risk of not being profitable yeah they

193
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,930
can speak with certainty I can't so

194
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,829
going and talking to senior management

195
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,050
about risk and cyber is hard these

196
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:27,888
regulation is actually some ways make it

197
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:31,160
easier because risk of breach mm-hmm

198
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:34,310
versus fines I can point to a number

199
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,290
HIPAA but hey look this company got fine

200
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,500
this many dollars for a breach looks

201
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,550
kind of like the risk you're having I

202
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,220
can't say that you're gonna have the

203
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,410
same loss but I can write to it ago that

204
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:51,290
number would suck so well the fine well

205
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,930
handled I can hedge against some risks I

206
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,410
can't really we can't really talk about

207
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,359
cyber risk in as well-defined terms and

208
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:04,420
we can't hedge against it as well as you

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:07,759
can say an insurance risk of flood so

210
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,849
and the other concept is most of the

211
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,459
time cyber risks are Nexus tension few

212
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,670
companies go out of business because of

213
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:19,779
a cyber problem right even companies to

214
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,899
think of like your entire business is in

215
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:26,720
keeping things private the example I

216
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,029
give this Ashley Madison right company

217
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,680
that was holding data that you really

218
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,990
really really don't want to get out

219
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:38,689
there and they get breach they're still

220
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,920
in business right so first it's like

221
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:41,060
other companies go to business because

222
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,209
you didn't you

223
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,770
you screwed up your ear model for

224
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,080
exchange rate fluctuations you screwed

225
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,790
up your model for what's going to be the

226
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,190
new product that you have to put out

227
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,829
right quinoa went out of business

228
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,480
because they just couldn't do retail

229
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,080
well I can't say all more than later

230
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Amazon

231
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,430
easy-easy others hard to do right so the

232
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,900
first thing I want to talk about is and

233
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,050
this is the interesting one whose SEC

234
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:12,260
guides SEC regulates publicly traded

235
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,050
companies in the United States and then

236
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,569
the kind of link to the cyber game

237
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:23,390
versus say SEC are going back to say the

238
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:26,660
banking regulators and new guidance is

239
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,400
that incidents usually that incidents

240
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,790
had to be reported to investors if they

241
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,800
materially affect an investor's

242
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:37,969
reasonable decision to invest in a

243
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,760
company or sell their shares now cyber

244
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:44,480
risks if they're substantial enough to

245
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,760
affect your your Bisset million

246
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,150
investors decision to buy or sell that

247
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:57,350
stock have to be reported when

248
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:58,939
well-known so those of you working in

249
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,100
cyber know that there's some there's

250
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,020
your the one or two problems that really

251
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,050
really bug you right they're the ones

252
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,420
that keep you up at night you finally

253
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,630
have a tool now if you're smart that you

254
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,089
can use to say it hasn't analysts think

255
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,760
of I started to get a back with thanks

256
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:19,160
but be I'm sure there's a there's an

257
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,480
email somewhere by someone in either

258
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,270
their DevOps arm

259
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:31,610
security aren't going we really need to

260
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:33,500
patch this high CBE it's well-known it's

261
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,030
well than be vulnerable all this is a

262
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,280
pageant maybe it was you didn't have

263
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,490
enough dev time to fix the underlying

264
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,990
application relied upon struts and that

265
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,620
all your devs are overwhelms and like

266
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:50,250
that off go away we think it's a

267
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:54,089
reasonable risk it hasn't been reached

268
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:56,370
yet that you know of but if it's a if

269
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,580
that risk is big enough that an investor

270
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:05,420
might say no or an investor who hold

271
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:08,610
stock might sell that has to be reported

272
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,160
so that's now all of a sudden kind of

273
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,770
interesting because I'm thinking of a a

274
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,790
did I did this week where a company was

275
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,740
was buying a little startup that had

276
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,990
really neat algorithm to do something

277
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,380
really cool and we did it we did a

278
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:28,020
review on that little company's

279
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:32,459
infrastructure and it was like it cost a

280
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,870
lot of money to fix all this algorithm

281
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:36,270
school I get to be at the school but

282
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,330
odds are since they've never done a code

283
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,610
review they've never done a pen test

284
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:45,770
you're it's gonna be a parade of hearts

285
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:50,130
when the outsiders go and Poquette and

286
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:53,490
got back on Friday they're changing

287
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:56,399
their valuation of the acquisition for

288
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,589
risk not for actual reach just for the

289
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,990
risk so all of a sudden this is starting

290
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:03,029
to being being through so SEC guidance

291
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,399
is broader than state rich unification

292
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:08,040
or HIPAA it's if there is a probability

293
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,399
that something is big enough to cause a

294
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,500
change in valuation right because you've

295
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,290
got state laws here's like PMI and

296
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,640
something else banking account password

297
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:24,060
govern ID if there's P PII health care

298
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,209
info this is just a breach of something

299
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:31,560
that's big enough to worry to our

300
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:35,219
investors so risk must be disclosed of

301
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,420
material to an investor interesting now

302
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,610
of course this is for publicly traded

303
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,750
companies if you're not publicly traded

304
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,760
the SEC guidance isn't

305
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,090
isn't isn't necessary if you're if

306
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,160
you're if you're not big enough to trip

307
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,990
that water that's us there but then

308
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,469
again every company that isn't publicly

309
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:57,040
traded it's thinking about the future so

310
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,680
if you've got that big ugly risk that's

311
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,349
not well understood outside of your shop

312
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,430
you can use this as a little bit of

313
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,200
leverage to say we should fix this

314
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,599
before you guys decide to do something

315
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,980
financial so next interesting bit is

316
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:20,470
theft trade commission after the lab

317
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:22,870
empties case FTC regulates interstate

318
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,780
trade well understood and around for a

319
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,750
long time they regulate unfair trade

320
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,880
practices and deceptive trade practices

321
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,330
and unfair trade practice is something

322
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,010
that is just we're going to hold it you

323
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,520
should be allowed to be in the business

324
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,050
if you were that far worse

325
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,819
there's deceptive trade practices where

326
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,849
we have lied to you about our product or

327
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:49,780
service in some ways and this comes out

328
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:52,450
of the Windham case Windham hotels had

329
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,610
on their website here's why you should

330
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,620
trust us with your with your data and I

331
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,890
was like yeah they had to click about

332
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,110
five links to get there and they said we

333
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,699
have good security holding credit cards

334
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,980
we have good security holding your

335
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,470
bookings and they you know that the

336
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,510
laughable level security credit card

337
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,200
stored in plain text on pyramid

338
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:17,560
accessible systems anyone in the hotel

339
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,320
could get on Wi-Fi and use that access

340
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,959
but it was like looking that like okay

341
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,589
anything realize this right for most

342
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,320
people

343
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,470
hotel security is like you're not we're

344
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,930
not we're not going banking regulator

345
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,190
said everyone who booked what's the

346
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,880
first thing you do when you look into

347
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,770
hotel

348
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,120
can I see your credit card and if

349
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,730
they're showing that in plain text on a

350
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,800
server that's accessible anyone on the

351
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:47,190
guest Wi-Fi and well the head reach

352
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,189
dumped a bunch of stuff and let you see

353
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:53,160
what happened I'm saying you're a

354
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,680
deceptive because you said you had

355
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,270
security you did but we're also going to

356
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,370
we're going after you under the idea

357
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,650
that it was that your security was so

358
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,280
bad even if you didn't make the promise

359
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:08,579
it was unfair you shouldn't be allowed

360
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,339
to get away with that even if you didn't

361
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:16,439
lie that we didn't you know fights back

362
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:19,199
window losses all of a sudden FTC says

363
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,590
wait a minute we just kind of stumble

364
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,290
into being in cyber security regularly

365
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:28,349
for non banking non-healthcare non

366
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,180
government contractors so all the other

367
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:36,929
business did ninety-nine percent of the

368
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:39,510
economy all the other businesses the

369
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:43,610
people sell you car cars the people sell

370
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,800
your tires the people send up food and

371
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:49,560
your cable company all that also that

372
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,050
are under that FTC regulation and all of

373
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,320
a sudden now it's like well there's a

374
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:58,500
standard now of course FTC couldn't FTC

375
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,939
quickly come to scramble said okay what

376
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,120
do we want to kind of establish as a

377
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,720
stand and they they weren't allowed to

378
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,600
establish like something like him misny

379
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,830
853 missed 800 170 water

380
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,899
I studied 27001 to they're like we can

381
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,710
establish a standard that is not

382
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,050
laughable

383
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,760
we can go on for that you know the stuff

384
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,280
that's like that's horrible

385
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:28,350
twelve year olds go oh god damn that's

386
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,560
an ass scared yeah and all of a sudden

387
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,449
they're like knocking on doors and going

388
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,760
we have a complaint

389
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,570
your security is bad someone stayed here

390
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,779
hotel

391
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,629
someone ate at your restaurant and they

392
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,639
like I'm thinking of Red Robin first

393
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:48,090
time I eat it one with four of my

394
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:50,370
co-workers we spent more time messing

395
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,779
with touchscreen to figure out if we can

396
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,779
own it than we did

397
00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:00,269
I won't say whether or not we breached

398
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,279
it but lastly bad security was there

399
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:05,730
regulatory power and with liability

400
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,169
there's a complaint what what they do is

401
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,260
they do a consent decree where they say

402
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:13,500
you must now meet these standards and

403
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,350
they were still they weren't baculum

404
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,450
they're like okay there's a reasonable

405
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,830
those are the sort of things that any

406
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,899
vendor management process would require

407
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,789
if you're a larger company bringing on a

408
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,219
vendor you would ask for these things

409
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:34,529
but there it's higher than laughable and

410
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:37,440
my money says you can't make us you can

411
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:39,690
say you can declare that are our

412
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,820
standards are insufficient but you

413
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:46,830
cannot give us a set of standards and

414
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:51,120
make us meeting they have a lawsuit and

415
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:54,408
Maddie wins FTC can't require specific

416
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,539
controls they can say your controls are

417
00:19:54,409 --> 00:20:00,480
insufficient and we pursue you but they

418
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,490
can't say you will be pursued unless you

419
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,639
meet these standards and realizes it's

420
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,190
splitting hairs but it essentially cuts

421
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:10,559
the FTC's power a little bit so they can

422
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,600
go after you if you're laughably bad but

423
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:18,260
they can't say you didn't meet our

424
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,029
standards they can't set a standard gdpr

425
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,309
anybody here not anyone here hasn't

426
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:25,139
heard of it okay I was gonna ask you now

427
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,789
because I gave this talk once and people

428
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,580
put up their hands like what you know is

429
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,529
it nice under the rock you than them

430
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,949
right and I have friends who do whitey

431
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:36,010
in Europe in the life I would like there

432
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,870
to be some

433
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,760
talking about something other than GPR

434
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,330
okay but you know there are signs at bus

435
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,140
stations are you GDP are compliant I see

436
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,040
that every day

437
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,920
please stop so quick run-through still

438
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,129
this new data subjects you're an EU

439
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,300
citizen in the EU your data is protected

440
00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:01,450
under the GPR an EU subject in the

441
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:06,940
United States it's not you're an

442
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:09,700
American in Europe sorry but you citizen

443
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:14,310
or a permanent resident in the EU you're

444
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:17,260
covering why do you have that may 25th

445
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,690
yet somehow the Sun came up the next day

446
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,930
the internet still worked I checked I

447
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:25,000
spend a week in Spain a week ago and

448
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,550
they have internet and it's still like

449
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,440
it still works of course you know every

450
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,270
time you open the site that's like hey

451
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,370
you're coming from the you here's their

452
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:38,200
privacy policy we're gonna put cookies

453
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:42,070
on your system well it's interesting to

454
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,850
see what we've we've figured this out we

455
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,620
wrote privacy policies I of course we

456
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,050
won't see if they're actually help too

457
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:54,520
but we wrote privacy policies problem

458
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:56,020
fixed next problem but it's you know

459
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,260
they should be shoved up privacy

460
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,710
policies and we went to bed data

461
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,330
subjects have raised what a concept

462
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,660
David controllers have responsibilities

463
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:11,970
right I ask you for me to do my business

464
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:14,320
I have to I have some responsibilities

465
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,520
now first what means it's interesting

466
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,720
was it's got everyone beats this up

467
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,610
significant fines four percent of gross

468
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,130
revenue were twenty million euro and I

469
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:27,250
realized that a 20 million euro fines

470
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:30,310
like okay I'm paying attention now even

471
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,470
even the most tired I don't care or

472
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,780
members like 20 million euros something

473
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:42,040
that I can comprehend that's a lot of

474
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:45,670
money also more importantly and they

475
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,490
stopped be the processing which is you

476
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,760
may not process Anna

477
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:54,540
you may not process EU citizen data

478
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:58,530
which basically means you have to you

479
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:03,090
cannot you know if you you have to go to

480
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:04,710
cash only are and if you're in a data

481
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,020
broker like business like a social

482
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,120
networking all of us need all of a

483
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,760
sudden like wow we can't do our business

484
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:17,459
in your country we have to withdraw from

485
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:20,060
the market so fall out house of any

486
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,180
impact because we haven't actually seen

487
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:27,120
expensive regulation and I'd like to say

488
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,890
thank Facebook for their blunder because

489
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,989
that means that every privacy regulators

490
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,480
gonna chew on them for the next 18

491
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,640
months and all of our clients who are

492
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,650
smaller and markets like yeah

493
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,660
let's watch Facebook and see what comes

494
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:44,880
out of that you privacy policy good the

495
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,370
best guidance I've seen sadly comes out

496
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:53,990
of the UK's information control office

497
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:56,939
the ICL because the leaving the EU so

498
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,980
really really like valuable like they

499
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,400
eventually eighty checklist that you

500
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,850
click and it's like what do I do with

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,860
the data

502
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,980
I do this business okay these are your

503
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,750
requirements like it showed that to all

504
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,550
my clients I fill that out and come back

505
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,700
to me instead of me like coming in with

506
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:19,470
the questionnaire and when they finally

507
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,330
breaks it it won't be so close some

508
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,880
entities just leave the market entirely

509
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,649
I know you know handful companies were

510
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,130
like how much business do you do in the

511
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,780
EU and go like we have one French custom

512
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,880
like one French company doing business

513
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:38,060
with you like no there's one guy outside

514
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:41,400
of Paris like call them up and say shoes

515
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,040
how much money can make in person maybe

516
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:48,660
eighty year old this year no the last

517
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,530
five thanks is your product available

518
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,750
elsewhere yeah

519
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,260
Amazon about FR okay

520
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:57,630
yeah weird breath some companies left

521
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,408
something like add the system you want

522
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,320
Braille lots of unanswered questions

523
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:08,340
I still get this from my clients

524
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:10,230
probably get this until I die and it's

525
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,100
like a lot of them are hard a lot I'm

526
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,919
like I don't know

527
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,719
the one what is reasonable secure into

528
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,720
the article that requires security

529
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,740
acceptable in the nation of rights this

530
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,330
one is still puzzling me because you

531
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,330
have the right have you forgotten or

532
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,220
which is I want you in business with you

533
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:33,149
in the past I want you to delete all

534
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:36,630
that data unless it's required by your

535
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:40,350
company your country's laws and one

536
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:43,049
minute doing the IT staff of a company

537
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:45,480
that had a this substantial new presence

538
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:50,280
and I can't do their accents well

539
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:53,280
because it was to Germans French citizen

540
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,960
and to brace and the Brits are the

541
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:01,950
hardest to understand it will make

542
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:06,020
Northern England and I'm but the

543
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,020
question was we had a bunch of deal T's

544
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:22,340

that kind of my thumb from a deal tear

546
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,570
yes I remember them I don't know what

547
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:31,350
the gtp requires you to go through this

548
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,658
like how do you do that like here's a

549
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,350
bunch of Renick rates it'll find go find

550
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:39,480
and you know Hans pain in the ass who

551
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:43,168
I'll help this right have you forgotten

552
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,950
where to go all the BLTs like I don't

553
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:49,470
even know every everyone who's ever done

554
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,230
who's been a backup and then you get

555
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,809
that like here's a ragged here here's

556
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:59,269

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,610
like hey I'm new and shiny I'm gonna do

567
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,120
IT okay

568
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,070
what's your first job coffee what's the

569
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,439
next thing that's a BLT reader what's

570
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,889
what's that stack case what are you

571
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,750
doing

572
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:45,350
find everything that's cons is name on

573
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:50,090
and believe it how long will it take

574
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:52,189
until you lose your mind and someone's

575
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:55,340
like I'm gonna study something else I

576
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,529
don't want to do like how do you solve

577
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,510
that like I'm gonna wait and see right

578
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:02,149
if someone has to do it yes we have

579
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:06,820
deleted from all of her active stuff and

580
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:09,469
as far as we know those EMTs are gone

581
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:14,990
either there's gonna be a massive sale

582
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:19,370
on bulk magnet erasers it honza's data's

583
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:22,159
gone what about her backups yes how will

584
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:24,768
this get enforced every now this is the

585
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,779
fun part every member state has to

586
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:30,049
figure this out how to implement what

587
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:33,200
their guidance is going to be so french

588
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,930
rules may be different than italian

589
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,710
rules and specials

590
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:41,650
these rules because schrems max runs

591
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:45,070
facebook says that there's a minimum

592
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:47,200
standard under the gdp are under ninety

593
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,460
five forty six that was the GTR but

594
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,580
every member state can come up with

595
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:56,590
their own that are more restrictive just

596
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:58,419
to make things more fun so my prediction

597
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:00,159
is you know because it's going to be do

598
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,230
they go on for bad actors there's a lot

599
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,440
of people are just now they're the

600
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,480
people who actually need to get kind of

601
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,380
kicked out of the game right the

602
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,730
spammers the bad markers versus are

603
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,150
there going to be regular it's like I

604
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,770
want Facebook on my wall right versus

605
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,380
like their luncheon is like low-level

606
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,900
scumbag knock them out don't know and

607
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,340
each each each regulator is going to

608
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:31,210
have to figure out what they're gonna go

609
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:33,490
after other fun it is the privacy shield

610
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,150
might be going away for those of you who

611
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:39,330
are unfamiliar privacy shield was a

612
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:43,240
recognition that there is an idea that

613
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:47,020
well much of the internet comes out of

614
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,940
the United States because EU says for

615
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,520
you to process data you either have to

616
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,010
be in the EU or you have to be in a

617
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,700
country that has the same or similar

618
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:59,170
privacy rights to the easy use we don't

619
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,610
we don't meet that requirement because

620
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,040
we don't really have brought the see

621
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,290
laws here so all of a sudden like

622
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,870
Canadian made this data centers became

623
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,310
really hot properties Canada's

624
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,500
recognized having some work data

625
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:15,310
protection laws to be yeah so you're

626
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,610
using rapid stop all your drunk in

627
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:21,250
Canada however you want to vend export

628
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,750
export that data back and give exporting

629
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,150
data is kind of a weird concept like

630
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,410
it's in the cloud and then you're like

631
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,910
no but that part of the clouds Canada

632
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,610
well I want to process the entire

633
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,590
database no there are bunch of people in

634
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,750
that database so all of a sudden we have

635
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,490
like we create all this and privacy

636
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,130
shows about get pregnant recognition

637
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,270
like you can say I will follow me you

638
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:50,710
get a privacy laws at my company and

639
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:53,170
allow me here FTC true regulate me and

640
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,390
therefore okay just any way them good

641
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:58,960
you're good enough you can put everyone

642
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,880
in that big database however eager

643
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,220
regulars are doing like you really don't

644
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,340
enforce this or you might actually

645
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,960
suspend privacy shield so you actually

646
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:14,740
have to then put your stuff you know EU

647
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,270
or Canadian or are try think there are

648
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,490
other countries that mean that apartment

649
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,700
I generally recommend my clients like

650
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:25,360
look kind of a datacenters are for most

651
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:30,670
people fairly accessible to a us peace

652
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:35,590
staff hands on a server Toronto isn't

653
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:37,570
that far away so many it's like I'm

654
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,649
doing any wait-and-see approach of that

655
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:46,139
for my recommendations this is the fun

656
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:49,800
because we we can't be well enough alone

657
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,270
glambag is the attempt to get over a

658
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,460
ploy that Microsoft played a couple

659
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:58,000
years ago they have a they have a bunch

660
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:02,140
of there has your stuff is in Ireland

661
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,260
and Ireland is a really great place to

662
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:10,590
base stuff for the EU english-speaking

663
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:14,370
staff it's accessible and they don't tax

664
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:17,020
authors and software is considered right

665
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,959
authorship so it's a great piece even as

666
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,590
well select okay all of a sudden you

667
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:32,170
have like significant 90 presence in

668
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:36,399
Ireland the FBI says we want data held

669
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:42,420
on their servers and Microsoft says you

670
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,420
want data about an EU citizen stored

671
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,179
we don't have to give it you this

672
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:54,030
subpoena works for us

673
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:57,100
hell-bent sense that is Microsoft ie

674
00:32:54,030 --> 00:33:00,879
it's a subsidiary shorter but it's a

675
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,250
European subsidiary and they win they

676
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,460
win in court like direct that's outside

677
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:09,850
of them outside of FBI's jurisdiction

678
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,100
and goes in there we protect your

679
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,439
security well we have we have we use

680
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,830
Americans have to fix that we passed the

681
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,320
cloud act that says short Communications

682
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,449
Act from the wiretap Act do effect if

683
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,460
you are headquartered or you have

684
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,590
sufficient assets in the United States

685
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:30,430
you're under jurisdiction no matter

686
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:32,770
where the servers are so your big rack

687
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:36,240
of servers in Canada your big lack of

688
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:40,480
servers in Germany or France or the UK

689
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,450
you're you're incorporating the United

690
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,440
States your honor and and working rat

691
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:49,380
can get those we can force you to

692
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,820
divulge that information

693
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,420
Europeans don't like this for obvious

694
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,490
reasons so what that is a domestic

695
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:01,950
you're using a domestic wiretap or

696
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:04,600
domestic subpoena to effect that like

697
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:07,690
theoretically you should say go to the

698
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,819
Irish court and say I want that data

699
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,889
because there's a criminal investigation

700
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,010
all these tax evasion there's something

701
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,350
going on and let the Irish let their

702
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,510
jurisdiction the Chinaman's because it's

703
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:23,830
really hard to say how a New York Court

704
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,630
has jurisdiction over Island and well we

705
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,770
don't want to hear that so that's the

706
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:30,070
matter with the data stored if the

707
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:33,460
holders of US company and it conflicts

708
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:35,890
with the GDP our guard says it's a

709
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:39,659
famous subject in the EU server that you

710
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:42,790
that's us and you can get back like you

711
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,290
you can get a wiretap or get a story you

712
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,600
can get a subpoena or the equivalent you

713
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,759
just have to go to that country's courts

714
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:52,270
and say hi may have heard of us with the

715
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,600
FBI we have an investigation on this

716
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:57,580
person they'll work it out it's some

717
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,290
it's noble hoops I think you might say

718
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:06,610
no because they might say that doesn't

719
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:08,650
meet our requirements and say hey we

720
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:13,980
could just do that you know and also a

721
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:16,450
European Court may not be as flexible

722
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,980
they might not just go like yeah we'll

723
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,450
take your word for it you're there are

724
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,820
you in time so it's a bunch of language

725
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:28,750
about multilateral agreements versus

726
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,740
international agreements it's how it

727
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,600
plays out

728
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,310
is less important than what it's gonna

729
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,470
do to privacy shield because this is

730
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:37,210
being used as a reason to suspend the

731
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:41,109
privacy show that we as the United

732
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:43,360
States our laws don't have equivalent to

733
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,030
the European European data privacy

734
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:51,760
standards so whether this is gonna

735
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:54,970
filter count is especially as we have a

736
00:35:51,760 --> 00:36:00,070
tip for campaign for other things right

737
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:03,009
I wrote I started writing this when VW

738
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,680
had their little problem and we were

739
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:09,010
gonna find the living bejesus out of VW

740
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,580
and if you're unfamiliar a sizable chunk

741
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:17,080
of VW is owned by one of the German

742
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:20,560
states and so any injury to Volkswagen

743
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,390
is an injury to Germany all of a sudden

744
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,040
like and there's privacy stuff going

745
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,379
against Facebook it's a kid protecting

746
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,500
you want to do business here don't hurt

747
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,930
Volkswagen we can replace booking Google

748
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,870
we're not buying their cars but we are

749
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:38,140
using their services this is another tip

750
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:39,970
for khaki it's similar to customs duties

751
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,819
or whatnot to make sure the trade goes

752
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:46,399
on but we have

753
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,540
we think is a roughly fair agreement so

754
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,060
that's how that's how the stuff is

755
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,920
playing out it's going to change I'm

756
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,400
keeping an eye on it I recommend you do

757
00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:00,390
too if it's interesting to you okay and

758
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,930
the last interesting law is I forgot

759
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:06,509
what the acronyms are susta and pasta

760
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:08,460
it's sex trafficking used to be it used

761
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,230
to be that section 230 of the

762
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,080
Communications Decency Act essentially

763
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:16,680
said that any interactive provider of

764
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:20,370
information services was immune for what

765
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:23,220
the users did on that service if I

766
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:26,339
slammer you on reddit reddit is not

767
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,779
responsible for my shitposting and we

768
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,510
thought that was a good idea

769
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,250
right everyone ham it's a fundamental

770
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:36,390
rule the internet you're a rowdy troll

771
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,220
you're allowed to do things and you're

772
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,190
allowed whatever you say whatever you

773
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:46,560
post even if it's criminal doesn't

774
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:48,590
affect the provider however and then we

775
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,770
ever hear the company called Backpage

776
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:56,040
village Voice's personals ads it kind of

777
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,930
did a it was a not a knockoff but a

778
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,160
similar approach to say Craigslist right

779
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,259
except all of a sudden they were they

780
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,899
found out that was really profitable to

781
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,240
put escorts outside are to let people

782
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:13,890
who an escort adds up and all of a

783
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:16,319
sudden that was their business well some

784
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,170
people didn't like that and they sue

785
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,610
back page and back page says

786
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,950
communication with citizens and we're an

787
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:26,510
interactive computer service what our

788
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:29,790
users do on it ain't a problem go away

789
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:34,580
so sister foster removed that immunity

790
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:37,259
for sites that foster sex trafficking

791
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,750
so the overall you're not liable for the

792
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,210
content even if the content is paid for

793
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:45,060
by the provider even if the content is

794
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,860
edited by the provider and even if the

795
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:53,210
content describes a criminal activity

796
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:56,250
the new rule is that if you

797
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,349
operate are attempting to make an ICS

798
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,990
with the intent to promote or facilitate

799
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:04,049
the prosecution of another it is now a

800
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:08,430
criminal act in this also can result in

801
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:11,069
fines how's that work there's also the

802
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,680
aggravated violation if you promote it

803
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:15,779
for more than five people if you promote

804
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,169
from the other conditions if you believe

805
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:20,700
force or fraud are involved so yeah

806
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,730
promotes or facilitates five or more

807
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,038
persons and prostitution reckless

808
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:29,549
disregard that such conduct facilitated

809
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,569
sex trafficking and now there's a

810
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:33,119
difference between prostitute

811
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:35,759
prostitution is theoretically consensual

812
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,589
by both parties sex trafficking is where

813
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:43,500
the provider of the sexual services is

814
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:50,869
shall we say somehow induced via

815
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:52,980
violence fraud threats coercion so

816
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:56,089
knowingly assisting or supporting us

817
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,019
facilitating sex trafficking are

818
00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:00,869
facilitating five or more persons in

819
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:04,799
prostitution so if your Craigslist

820
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:09,119
our back page and you have five ads for

821
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:13,769
escorts you are in violation subject to

822
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:18,869
fines subject to subject to criminal

823
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:23,879
action prison for this so okay that

824
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:26,819
seems straightforward however how far

825
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,849
does that extend and susta pasta it's

826
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:33,869
not clear right if you know if you are

827
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:36,539
or own you're a company that that only

828
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:39,589
offers escort ads you're fairly clearly

829
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,589
like in that bucket

830
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,299
sex trafficking knowingly exists

831
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:47,309
recruits entices harbors transports

832
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:51,859
patronizes or solicits of minor for

833
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:55,049
commercial sex act we don't like that it

834
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:57,420
criminal is a sex worker ICS in the u.s.

835
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:58,790
that may be a bad thing or a good thing

836
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,410
depending

837
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,779
and hope this year there was a lively

838
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,730
debate about this because there were

839
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,270
some sex workers who came to talk about

840
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:12,690
how they use the internet to make their

841
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:17,160
make their I guess yes they call them

842
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:20,730
jobs safer they are in danger to to

843
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,980
provide their service and it makes a

844
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,020
parent if all of a sudden their ability

845
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,190
to talk to one another screen out

846
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:33,330
clients advertise it pushes them serve

847
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:35,400
them back into a pre-internet mode where

848
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,930
they were a lot more danger

849
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,450
some people may view that is a good

850
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:41,339
thing to eradicate prostitution other

851
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,879
people maybe that is a bad thing I won't

852
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:46,080
get into that debate right now but

853
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,880
intentionally the companies like back

854
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:53,040
page arrows , the two examples I found

855
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,200
are clearly in that market that's what

856
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,900
they do they provide headspace for

857
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:04,620
escorts what about an advocacy site a

858
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,150
site dedicated not perhaps but two for

859
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,390
sex workers to talk amongst themselves

860
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:13,410
about the business clearly it's

861
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:15,480
facilitation of prostitution even if

862
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,720
it's not actually the business thereof

863
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:22,860
it's not advertising and then doesn't

864
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,839
create a duty for sites that are not in

865
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:28,710
the business of prostitution but are

866
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:30,540
said merely sex positive I a friend of

867
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,540
mine is a also a lawyer in the

868
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:39,540
technology field and he pro bono

869
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:43,680
represents a I'm sorry I mention is a

870
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,480
furry site where some of you may laugh

871
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,790
some of you were like that's something

872
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,720
that I can only discuss on Tuesdays

873
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:54,360
I don't you either way whatever you know

874
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:59,459
whatever you do is fine please don't

875
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,810
make me see that so however his problem

876
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,800
was there were some people who were

877
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:07,350
professional furries and I I was like

878
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,250
what is that like no don't answer that

879
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:14,339
I don't want that image in my head but

880
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:16,830
they're like well some people you know

881
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,630
that's a side business like all the

882
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,880
sudden you just ran a phallus Estefan

883
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,980
stuff you know like one cut one of their

884
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,320
forms just shut down like this is too

885
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,320
much liability for us we're going away

886
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:38,399
good you know good bad for you but what

887
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,649
about a purely agnostic service provider

888
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:46,020
we just provide communication like

889
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:48,480
Twitter Lena people communicating with

890
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,740
one another and I'm thinking of the

891
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,020
problem that like a truly fantastic

892
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,899
communications provider right like you

893
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:00,840
you could probably figure out who the

894
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,500
sex workers are on your platform by

895
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,940
looking for specific code words right

896
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,650
someone who wants to talk about one

897
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,570
thing are going to use different terms

898
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:14,130
and people who are trying to get

899
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:18,120
business as a sex worker reddit did a

900
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:21,300
purge of any subway that even kind of

901
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:25,319
came close to this but what about

902
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:28,260
someone who is a co-sleeper right right

903
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,230
how do you there will be some your

904
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,120
environments really really hard right

905
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,970
you you have to basically do like full

906
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:39,120
packet inspection to look for to look

907
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,589
for bad words does and that's because

908
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,160
i'll because the fear is like they're

909
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:46,710
gonna come and make our racks if we

910
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,109
don't so all of a sudden like this

911
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:53,490
requires a great deal this puts certain

912
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:55,110
business models in jeopardy because

913
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,779
obviously now that you have to monitor

914
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:59,280
your network for this it's it's hard

915
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,940
enough that like you large fries feed a

916
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,590
monitor for things like piracy like it's

917
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,190
you know I've talked to some people

918
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:10,950
innocent images that's the we find child

919
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,500
porn on the internet and it's possible

920
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,960
it's actually like technically it's it's

921
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,030
a it's a simple idea - it's a simple

922
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,480
problem to describe you like we have md5

923
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:24,270
hashes of known child sex images we look

924
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,109
for those if we find one we report it

925
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,440
okay

926
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:31,049
that's technically you know it's easy to

927
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,900
describe it's hard to do but it's an

928
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:39,359
engineering problem how do you do that

929
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:41,430
for bad words right all of a sudden

930
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,940
you've a much more difficult problem and

931
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:47,759
you still have to so it's a it's a it's

932
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:51,210
a potential danger for people in sort of

933
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,220
public facing ID if you're providing a

934
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,680
communication service to the general

935
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,859
public that you any you know think

936
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,828
you're fee the overhead it does write

937
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:04,380
for a company like like AWS like spool

938
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:07,500
up a VM look they want to make it as

939
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,380
cheap as possible no customer service at

940
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,480
all because it's that all sudden makes

941
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,980
it really unprofitable we're spending

942
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,400
more for the customer service than they

943
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,559
are for the computer and the network if

944
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:24,890
we have to monitor it that drives up the

945
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:28,799
price so reactions and trends to this I

946
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:30,839
think especially GDP are is we're going

947
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:32,670
to see geofencing the data we're going

948
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,980
to see essentially a still like we're

949
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,559
gonna say our European operations are

950
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:41,309
over there any month at so far as to do

951
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:44,940
like a business separation we have a

952
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:49,770
European subsidiary or I can actually

953
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:51,780
with them is is like they don't work to

954
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:54,390
us we don't work to them they're a

955
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,920
separate company there's some money that

956
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,859
changes hands at the end of every year

957
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,069
and maybe all they do is a really

958
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:04,730
license or IP software development is

959
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:08,700
done you know how it's done accept

960
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:10,290
ownership the code moves around and it

961
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,490
might be like you're less of a company

962
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,279
and more like a bunch of holding

963
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:17,899
companies or it might just be you have a

964
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:20,180
flag for arguing EU citizen or not

965
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,250
that to your database so that way you do

966
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:26,089
you don't allow people to search for

967
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:27,710
stuff you don't allow people to you

968
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,770
could do anything you wanted the

969
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:33,140
American data said your beam dataset you

970
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:36,020
have to have some kind of waiver to

971
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,879
allow that kind of processing but you're

972
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:43,550
gonna have to think about how did we get

973
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:47,720
that that PII are these claiming to do

974
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:50,120
so not my client I'm thankful went

975
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,759
through a lot of other tools to scope

976
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,190
out every individual country where they

977
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,400
got data they held essentially health

978
00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:00,560
care data it's people looking for health

979
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,960
care providers and talking about their

980
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,600
health care problems and the fun part

981
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,520
was in fact handling individual

982
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,750
countries in case France changed the law

983
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:14,270
and then marketing wrote a script to go

984
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:18,020
and suck up data from all the databases

985
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:20,930
and put it on and I'm not making this up

986
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:24,140
the unencrypted laptop of someone in

987
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:26,480
marketing like so I knew the engineer

988
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:28,370
like build this and we had many many

989
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,230
conversations over beers with a light

990
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:32,569
more like here's how you fit all the

991
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:35,930
rags and then let's talk engineering is

992
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:38,330
ok fine I got it I gotta prove all three

993
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,220
that I hired three DevOps people and a

994
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,720
bunch of engineers and we did this and

995
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,490
then he calls me up at two in the

996
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,939
morning like it's six months later he's

997
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:49,419
like you wouldn't believe

998
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:57,740
tell me that's true right so someone

999
00:48:49,420 --> 00:49:02,210
will just sequel I made wrong and so

1000
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,950
he's got and he'll fix that so claiming

1001
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,380
to to geofencing because you can only

1002
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,890
screw that up it's gonna be a lot of

1003
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,240
hand waving

1004
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:15,200
yeah sure we're compliant yep we do that

1005
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,580
don't have any questions yeah yeah yeah

1006
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,020
we're gonna make process we're gonna

1007
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,640
make we're gonna make promises that we

1008
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,130
have no intention of keeping

1009
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,560
I see withdrawing through markets I

1010
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,970
imagine you're going to have eat you

1011
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,230
company is also drawing from the

1012
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,730
American market like

1013
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,190
that's too much of a headache because

1014
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,170
all of a sudden you're afraid that

1015
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,359
you're u.s. subsidiaries doing stuff

1016
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:38,960
that you've trained here of them your

1017
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,850
use your you snap not to do but someone

1018
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,350
in marketing in the u.s. oh yeah we got

1019
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,740
this thing to say let's do something

1020
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,990
with it

1021
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,220
but no so someone in France is getting a

1022
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:52,220
phone call too like what

1023
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:54,618
what did marketing do okay I'm getting

1024
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,270
up so so you might just have like yeah

1025
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:58,640
we're gonna withdraw from the US market

1026
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:04,790
so like it's just too much of a pain to

1027
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:07,759
sell for them we're out every shop that

1028
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,770
had 840 you presents got the the

1029
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,780
boatload of right to be forgotten

1030
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:19,430
requests if you are in that space in an

1031
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:22,040
automate them would be aces because I I

1032
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,890
was helping one client through this and

1033
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:30,440
we get three or four a day

1034
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:32,240
and day one they got 9,000 if you want

1035
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,240
to be right for done we had forgotten at

1036
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,779
company look at no one's gonna bother

1037
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,129
with that like we had to increase the

1038
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,930
size of our Excel

1039
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:46,540
we had increase the size of the mailbox

1040
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,540
in exchange it was bouncing back

1041
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:54,890
can I eat those words that says you

1042
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:57,230
probably don't need a automated pull q3

1043
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,270
because I I made that recommendation

1044
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,640
thing that would be expensive because I

1045
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:12,700
couldn't write like you know that's

1046
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:14,960
gonna be a lot of Python somehow they

1047
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,730
last time I send them a statement work I

1048
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,010
just got back up yeah we'll get back

1049
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:21,350
deal okay

1050
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,570
conflicting boiled egg contracts this is

1051
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:26,240
a big cake because you have your other

1052
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,980
contracts that you wrote right for all

1053
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,169
your other stuff and some lawyer

1054
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:33,290
reviewed them and now you have all these

1055
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:35,180
EU privacy ones that me cuz you have

1056
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,590
like your American privacy or American

1057
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,870
one that has something like we're not

1058
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,910
liable for anything right that's in

1059
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:42,500
every contract and then well you know we

1060
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,740
don't have we can do whatever we want to

1061
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,810
your data hahahaha and then you have

1062
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,490
that contract you have the EU contract

1063
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,650
that says here your rights it's like

1064
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:57,379
well I sign both of them what do they

1065
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:58,790
mean I don't know either so that's

1066
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,080
another thing you're gonna have to go

1067
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,110
through it right or rewrite your

1068
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,819
American contracts because I have

1069
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,770
European customers and all of a sudden

1070
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,870
you have to make them you know we review

1071
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,670
all those and you may have had them

1072
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:12,230
already in space and now you have to

1073
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:14,270
push them out to your salespeople and

1074
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:18,230
make sure that they need all those

1075
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:21,410
requirements again so predicting the

1076
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:23,180
future are we gonna see a u.s.

1077
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,859
equivalent there's the California

1078
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:30,279
consumer Privacy Act that looks like a

1079
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:32,930
mini u.s. GDP are some more rights

1080
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,610
private right of action that's an

1081
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,680
interesting one that allows you to sue

1082
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:40,370
if they don't do it you don't have that

1083
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:43,240
right yeah under the GBR but you do have

1084
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:45,859
the right in California

1085
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:50,000
non-discrimination for opt out as in I

1086
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:53,600
can't charge more money to make you up

1087
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,460
Dell I can offer incentives right the

1088
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,330
non privacy one where we get to sell all

1089
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:01,240
your stuff that's free you charge but it

1090
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,799
that's going to be interesting

1091
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,299
we're embassy can't forget enforcement

1092
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:09,310
against

1093
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:12,550
you se eu companies cheap cars a great

1094
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:14,710
tool to use for a regulator that wants

1095
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:17,410
to not necessary for privacy rights but

1096
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,090
you put you put in careth on our product

1097
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:23,200
and it's an important product for our

1098
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:25,480
country you know we don't buy your cars

1099
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,410
you drink our wine all of a sudden we

1100
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,300
don't sell us much wine how do we get at

1101
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:33,220
you well Facebook we're gonna go out

1102
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,080
there Facebook until you come to come

1103
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:39,009
there chance G beer can use effectively

1104
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,049
liability from a the beaches I'm

1105
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:43,750
thinking this is going to compel we're

1106
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:47,110
going to see some kind of uniform data

1107
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:48,700
breach where there's actually fines are

1108
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,530
not actually funds but actual private

1109
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,710
right of action where you can sue our

1110
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:55,690
class action for loss of data and will

1111
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,060
stand on us this across the 50 states

1112
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:02,950
rather than every state have been kind

1113
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:05,680
of their own waters right now it's

1114
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:07,120
mostly for financial information but

1115
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,649
think of a lot of stuff that isn't

1116
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:13,900
financial health care that's still

1117
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:14,980
embarrassing you know photos of you you

1118
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,290
know photos of you doing something

1119
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:20,530
stupid that you thought or private art

1120
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:25,050
that gets out just embarrassing stuff

1121
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:25,050
about you that you don't want on be spin

1122
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:33,370
individual states might do this but the

1123
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:35,920
feds the under federal law if the US

1124
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:38,440
Congress passes a law it can essentially

1125
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,330
3-amp the state law to say that this is

1126
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,460
now the requirement that might actually

1127
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:45,670
be good if we have one set of standards

1128
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:48,250
across because it's difficult not to go

1129
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:52,540
okay we're doing business in the EU we

1130
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:57,310
have to track the 30 odd EU countries we

1131
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:59,650
have 50 states you know how how does a

1132
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,799
degree mark in Florida it's different

1133
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:04,270
than the data breach in Nevada they're

1134
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,130
getting more and more similar but it'll

1135
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:13,170
be nice to have one set of laws that

1136
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:13,170
make it a lot easier any questions

1137
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:21,779
sure some of this stuff already and I'm

1138
00:55:18,029 --> 00:55:25,559
seeing multinational companies freaking

1139
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:27,359
into these their aks so there's there's

1140
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:30,779
a parent company and then there's a

1141
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:34,170
middle company and then there's a slew

1142
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:37,469
of small companies that are there just

1143
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:41,309
as LLC's to just defend against lawsuits

1144
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:43,170
and it's world yeah okay and the

1145
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:45,329
question is are the observations that

1146
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:48,150
we're seeing where you're basically not

1147
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:50,219
one company or a bunch of closely moving

1148
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,630
companies and that's that's a fairly

1149
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:54,960
standard thing to do for liability

1150
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,630
controls my favorite one is in

1151
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,299
Philadelphia where I live I see

1152
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:05,670
companies are often a mob of little

1153
00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:09,059
LLC's LLC's assets are a like a 1998

1154
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:12,420
Crown Vic with 4,000 miles like that's

1155
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:16,759
your asset yeah that he'll see at you

1156
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:20,630
like that LLC has 82 dollars in assets

1157
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:23,219
yeah you can sue them like I'm you know

1158
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:54,059
my friends got a broken leg and you're

1159
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:58,249
like yeah this is something like which

1160
00:56:54,059 --> 00:57:04,319
could have you know some sort of

1161
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:07,468
legislation or this is a problem called

1162
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,269
dueling experts it and and oftentimes

1163
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:11,579
you don't you you don't want the judge

1164
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:13,589
to have to know anything you want an

1165
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:15,450
expert on your side that tells the story

1166
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:17,480
I've done I've

1167
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:21,419
do this help prepare expert testimony

1168
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:24,000
for what I think of this ignorant IT

1169
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,369
control so it was like you are so

1170
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,270
negligent in doing their lady that you

1171
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:32,700
deserve to get sued like all over all of

1172
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:36,960
our client data is on the server at a

1173
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:38,970
cola and you came as a person working at

1174
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,920
the data center and you unwrap

1175
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:43,529
everything in the rack including our

1176
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,780
server and wipe them despite the sticker

1177
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:48,420
that said property of so-and-so dental

1178
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,369
office call this person before doing

1179
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,960
anything to mean like oh yeah I cleaned

1180
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:55,980
all these systems like those weren't

1181
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,180
yours and we had we were working on the

1182
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,250
team that was like the dental office

1183
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,049
going I want to sue these people in the

1184
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,059
Bolivian our entire client was it was

1185
00:58:01,049 --> 00:58:05,309
story correctly all of a sudden that's

1186
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:10,920
going on we're the backups that's the

1187
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:13,819
next person you want to sit so yeah but

1188
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:19,670
we had to go and like explain to a judge

1189
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:23,849
what what backups were and what sort of

1190
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:26,640
industry standard level of competence is

1191
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:30,349
expected for someone who says I are an

1192
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,348
IT professional trust me

1193
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,069
anything interesting going on in like

1194
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,009
administrative law Speer since we had

1195
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:52,009
like that recent advent change ooh

1196
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:53,760
interesting so the question is is

1197
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:55,770
administrative law which is survey a

1198
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,349
neat little subset where you have a

1199
00:58:55,770 --> 00:59:00,599
regulation that comes out of a law you

1200
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:02,819
know you you grant power to regulate the

1201
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:05,809
law grants power to regulate authority

1202
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:11,670
that they can then promulgate new rules

1203
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:13,420
are really define those rules I see that

1204
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:17,530
a lot in banking I

1205
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:19,980
because that's a small change in a

1206
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:22,809
regulatory requirement is a lot of money

1207
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:29,170
both to your business and also to your

1208
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:32,559
IT in your IT department usually there's

1209
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:35,950
a survey a sub business in my space of

1210
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,480
people who do very very specific

1211
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,339
industry consulting they know that

1212
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,010
industry they know it's it's heavily

1213
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:44,290
regulated healthcare and banking in the

1214
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:47,619
tune that I think of and there's

1215
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:49,599
watching little changes you watch both

1216
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:52,240
industry there'll be often regulatory

1217
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,589
guidance still the regulatory agency

1218
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,058
will put out a white paper that says

1219
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:57,940
this is what we're concerned about these

1220
00:59:55,059 --> 01:00:00,369
are the audit guidelines like Health and

1221
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:03,520
Human Services Office of Civil Rights

1222
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:06,730
would Sal audit guidelines for HIPAA and

1223
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,880
hi-tech and then you're reading like

1224
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:13,059
statements made and talks by high-level

1225
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:16,750
regulators and I remember once sitting

1226
01:00:13,059 --> 01:00:18,670
in a room we had their welcome you do

1227
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,710
and we're going through like line by

1228
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,359
line and are they only at that and this

1229
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:25,180
was like 9 o'clock and I was working

1230
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:28,750
does that mean this rule has changed and

1231
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:31,029
this is required and I was like one

1232
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,250
point this is bizarre another part of

1233
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:35,920
this millions of dollars to one of our

1234
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:39,250
clients so the difference between and

1235
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,250
and ours all suddenly critically

1236
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:44,950
important it's always it's it's not just

1237
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:49,540
necessarily the administration it's the

1238
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:51,490
head of that apartment because

1239
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,960
oftentimes a new one will come in and

1240
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:55,328
say this is this is what our department

1241
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,220
is concerned about the other things are

1242
01:00:55,329 --> 01:01:00,040
less important and you try to figure out

1243
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,990
what they want so it's it's watching

1244
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,490
audit got all the guidelines usually the

1245
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:06,819
website watch work cuz that's like

1246
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:09,250
actual stuff like yeah this is what we

1247
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:09,609
have concerns about like when SEC came

1248
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:15,249
out

1249
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:19,989
this many years ago and said we're we're

1250
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:23,680
following as a standard the NIST

1251
01:01:19,989 --> 01:01:26,529
cybersecurity the CSF while every other

1252
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:35,980
sort of financial service was regulated

1253
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:37,839
by FFIEC not but there's a set of like

1254
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,529
here's the controls were expecting also

1255
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:41,589
it whoa

1256
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:43,779
we have a new set interested why are

1257
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:45,400
they doing see a Sabbath and then all of

1258
01:01:43,779 --> 01:01:48,579
a sudden well because have to read the

1259
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,609
CSF now and so it's it's you can watch

1260
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:53,589
this by basically looking for audit

1261
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:57,249
guidelines and that's level I would play

1262
01:01:53,589 --> 01:02:00,999
at seeing like in also looking for any

1263
01:01:57,249 --> 01:02:02,439
regulatory enforcement actions see what

1264
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:03,939
do they actually care about what did

1265
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,730
they go for but at that point you're

1266
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,739
getting you can do a lot of stuff all

1267
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:11,680
from white paper so where I go that will

1268
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:13,749
sum up hundreds of pages stopping like

1269
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,220
one you know into five points where you

1270
01:02:13,749 --> 01:02:20,348
go do I actually have to worry about

1271
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:22,439
this or can I stop caring cool no other

1272
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:22,440
questions

1273
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:25,849
[Music]

1274
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:36,649
[Music]

1275
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:55,009
so the question is like how do we work

1276
01:02:49,849 --> 01:03:00,530
with European ISPs they have to fit with

1277
01:02:55,010 --> 01:03:03,200
a 8th apology PR for their customers how

1278
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:05,420
they're holding their data you may see

1279
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,490
where a nice B that's in both countries

1280
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:09,859
both both environments make bifurcate

1281
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:13,430
and go here's how we store you data

1282
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:14,359
here's how the story US data a lot of

1283
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:18,160
times they're still different

1284
01:03:14,359 --> 01:03:21,160
subsidiaries anyway and I'm not the kind

1285
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,160
thanks
