2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:45,120
and some courtesy wanna where I work in

3
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,160
organization call these are key ciphers

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,899
to and this is really what our were

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,300
stationed in Casas admissions tape this

6
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,489
our Kurdish statement and our new one we

7
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,860
have new boss took over a couple years

8
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,169
ago so you updated but really is talking

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,850
about impactful partnerships and then

10
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,859
building intellectual capital in for

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,349
cybersecurity to impact really the

12
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,700
national security and so even with our

13
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,520
new mission statement conducting

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,650
industry research which I'm a huge fan

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,149
of and hopefully the shape features boss

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,490
and then develop innovative solutions

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,259
for what we think are these problems

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,369
that we're gonna be facing in the first

19
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,490
century and being in this room it mostly

20
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,640
all aware of all the implications from

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,169
quino's we have seen your review of all

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,220
these side perhaps I'll take your place

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,990
and again what is a CI we do that was

24
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,420
our mission statement but what I wanted

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,439
to is willing to play a video that that

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,439
cement did

27
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,109
[Music]

28
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,359
[Music]

29
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,610
yes so they bought one whole wall back

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,799
solve certain airway through this what

31
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,170
seemeth there was a two minute clip on

32
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:18,720
Norma cyrus - and just talk about what

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,119
we do at Westland did have some West

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:28,560
Linn itself United States Military

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Academy and as part of the keep some

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,819
gift for Mac security what we're

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,650
teaching blood next Mouse I'm security

38
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,630
I'll go through a little more details on

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,310
what's going on West Point but really in

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,709
this video clip that's talking about the

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,330
[Music]

42
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,459
get cyber challenge team and we all see

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,750
three teams they're doing sexually

44
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,250
what's going on upstairs

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,140
the but the captured flight compass so

46
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,269
in this case you know West Point cadets

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:00,089
teams taking along the other serfs

48
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:02,720
cavities they're making those only find

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,720
out that maybe

50
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,569
[Music]

51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,440
and so in this case it's just talking

52
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:46,620
about the scores already and if we see

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:56,880
how many maybe I gave a talk last year

54
00:03:46,620 --> 00:04:00,420
here any comments I think so here's my

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,040
boss my boss Andy ball I really talk

56
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,510
about the mission of our designers to

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,730
again talking about the problems of a

58
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,920
triangle research in or promote national

59
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,119
security and really what he's talking

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,320
about is really trying to promote a

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,020
wolf-like national or a

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,280
multidisciplinary approach oh well we do

63
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,930
its army service truth I'm already

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,420
wasn't well with the army research

65
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:25,770
researchers are I'm on the systems

66
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:28,260
engineering researchers from the fire

67
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:33,090
historians declarative stories

68
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,300
I hired English professors teaching

69
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,299
ethics

70
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,289
people we have policy folks teach

71
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,889
international issues to the American

72
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,930
politics

73
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,790
and we have a bunch of engineers the

74
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,790
basis of the artifacts from bunch of

75
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,430
education errors on the system see we

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,979
have mathematicians we have a lot of

77
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,240
STEM disciplines what's interesting that

78
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,849
we have all these other disciplines

79
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,740
ok I think the approach we take is that

80
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:02,419
this is not a cybersecurity stop just

81
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,590
finding out that's going to take all the

82
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:14,750
disciplines that we have policies

83
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:17,450
solutions that was good time since I ran

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,880
out the narration but the way I look at

85
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,099
history actually from the warfare from

86
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,979
my military historian perspective is

87
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,080
that if we look at what history is

88
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,000
punished right look at the warfare I

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,070
think it's kind of interesting right

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,550
there's a think pre-industrial warfare

91
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,650
it was some physical aspect of the

92
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,510
victor that gave them right that's

93
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:43,810
pulled off a victory right usually its

94
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,810
size right physical strength

95
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,979
right at some type of physical advantage

96
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,810
typically gives you that one got into

97
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,810
the right industrial right term century

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,510
that's what warfare less commendable

99
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,960
resources those became the Wars of

100
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,760
attrition

101
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,620
I think role won World War two war

102
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,630
ventures millions worth Patricia now the

103
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,450
impacted us to look around we get into

104
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,909
didn't even work right alcohol to art

105
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,599
right the nice dates then simply didn't

106
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:22,160
work on the smart one no I talked about

107
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,139
this bloodline laughter but nuclear

108
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,669
warfare is talking about knowledge in

109
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,669
physics physics

110
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:47,919
please don't knowi know this was not

111
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,810
part of the university now only the

112
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,280
cyberwarfare you feel about your cyber

113
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,229
work where the interesting thing is it's

114
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,809
not just knowledge it's the speed of

115
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,370
knowledge from top-secret hearing to the

116
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,500
past couple days you should be

117
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,270
understanding that the speed of

118
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,159
innovation now the speed of getting

119
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,190
things right is more fruitful and not

120
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,539
just knowing your honor because we know

121
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,550
that from all these separate apps right

122
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:13,509
if you can stop the side effects quicker

123
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,740
you get manage the conference all

124
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,880
surgery especially if you're on the

125
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:32,530
offensive side you can attack faster

126
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:35,440
that's okay just going back to the

127
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,210
military academy site now now it is a

128
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,979
liberal arts program it's a very

129
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,109
structured program I have a 1994

130
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,639
graduate so I tell them because I teach

131
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,560
it it's much better the second time

132
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,759
around this is my third time going back

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,389
to the west place the third time through

134
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,520
this rather slender part very structured

135
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:54,280
curriculum and so the interesting thing

136
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,318
is right every cadet has to take this

137
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,090
vision course for students if they're

138
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,610
not an injury major it have to take

139
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,340
three engineering courses so unlike most

140
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,380
colleges are you choose one I remember I

141
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,198
chose my major and I only had two

142
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,199
electives to peer like all the others

143
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,689
[Music]

144
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,540
[Music]

145
00:08:26,100 --> 00:09:54,910
right so again now the highlight systems

146
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,340
and cyber of the antennas for sequences

147
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,140
systems on systems assignments mainly

148
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,390
they started teaching a cyber sequence

149
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,569
last year for the first time to the

150
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,830
offshoot really

151
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:11,720
the electrical electrical engineering

152
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:14,210
focus on sex now this is where our Dean

153
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,980
tells us we're doing as as instructed

154
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,960
for parent graduates who are scientific

155
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,190
illiterate and capable applying

156
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,100
mathematical engineering computational

157
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,920
modes thought solution complex homes

158
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:28,460
okay so I knew I was on firm ground when

159
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,140
I was teaching my class now this is a

160
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,690
way of the system's your core sequence

161
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,569
works three four sequence again these

162
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,530
are perfect cadets who are not

163
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,930
engineering natives right so these are

164
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,870
the nets or the like we call them the

165
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,229
post numbers these are this software

166
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:48,410
soccer sizes and so for MST could be

167
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,600
hundred orange roughy course again you

168
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,230
see a military approach we like using

169
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,210
called walk right approach and I first

170
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,430
this se 300 in front of course it

171
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,830
teaches a lot of definitions teach a lot

172
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,109
framework for how to solve problems I go

173
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,910
about doing the stapler analysis from

174
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,260
definition might actually will argue but

175
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,600
this is only the most important thing

176
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,110
for 50 of course I teach I still have

177
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,550
this that's what solve the wrong problem

178
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,550
there I work two semesters for life

179
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,790
going into an SUV 15 I bought this

180
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,160
course as well what this course is

181
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,939
primarily using MSM cell using

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,630
spreadsheets to get me wanting

183
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,160
qualitative solution to your on geysers

184
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,430
we teach I'm willing to swallow a math

185
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,430
class

186
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,829
but it's really trying to get folks are

187
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,839
very comfortable using Excel spreadsheet

188
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:53,199
walling to come up with irrational

189
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:57,730
centers and five of course I like last

190
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:59,979
two years real-world budgets we're using

191
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,089
room or budgets where the cadets have to

192
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:11,860
work and you don't know before have a

193
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:17,920
solution so what I introduced the course

194
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:20,110
was second s in dil Florida they came

195
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,719
for a visit to our realization one you

196
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,550
look I'm sorry Steve all about and our

197
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,290
previous director had a nice boat I hope

198
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,229
you use this anytime we have a lot of

199
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:35,889
visitors you guys have a lot of visitors

200
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:36,569
to our decisions well yeah every time we

201
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:42,069
have a guest

202
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:43,660
yes we also haven't asked and asked the

203
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,479
interesting it doesn't have a roundtable

204
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,279
and we asked what can this fluoridation

205
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,540
do for us it's not that they're just in

206
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,490
you know three things must what can they

207
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,259
do for us and sometimes something as

208
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,899
easy as help help promote our own

209
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,029
conference we close the conference as

210
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,800
well as any con here we host in

211
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,790
Washington DC each year in the Pope

212
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,399
timeframe

213
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:09,370
beside the pump the conference cyclone

214
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:11,019
us but our asking when we had general

215
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,220
Austin at that time was the commander of

216
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:17,889
the force our commander of the eccentric

217
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,630
man we asked them hey you applied it's

218
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,630
that you might test work on that's not

219
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,510
that's where I will give you another

220
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:30,470
kind of small okay lots of pension and

221
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,470
said myself once all right

222
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,459
so Central Command they gave us not just

223
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,560
they did gifts the handful butters

224
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,830
actually gave me plenty my buttocks and

225
00:13:43,560 --> 00:14:00,900
so these were some of the parts they get

226
00:13:45,830 --> 00:14:04,230
stuff that I'm looking good right now

227
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,079
though okay so they did was really I

228
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,470
have three wolves I have three rules for

229
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,360
subsequently when a sponsor I want to

230
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,010
augment really wanna be sure so had to

231
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,810
be a world war that they do want I

232
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,810
wanted something that was long approval

233
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,680
path so I get not one project that was

234
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,060
that they had their own good ones

235
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,620
already too much seasons because I

236
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,089
didn't want to be tied to their fights

237
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,730
because I feel again I wine clubs that

238
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,260
were complex more complex to better

239
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,670
their children something that they

240
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,770
really need tell what but they just

241
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:41,310
didn't have an advocacy man there's a

242
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:43,140
woman fighting Iraq Syria a scam they're

243
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,400
pretty busy folks and some of they have

244
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,010
not made these plays I thought they were

245
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:53,280
great movies I actually thought all 24

246
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:55,170
plus a 25 plug that Union but first

247
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,300
you're teaching this two years ago and

248
00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:00,930
for teams if you look at some of these

249
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,089
products right assist part part of the

250
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,969
nation defenses a bolster trust it's

251
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,130
pretty complex for undergraduate in

252
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,410
table she was Tony and sparkly stones a

253
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,880
cyber team to you spike surge of

254
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,219
information out what that means for the

255
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,140
US military and an operation mighty

256
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,940
senators holy smokes when it gets got

257
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,220
these projects they were overwhelmed I

258
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,110
told them it's okay I told them they are

259
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,030
just like me when I first started our

260
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,420
diversity and the great thing is you

261
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:30,030
hopefully get from this talk is a way to

262
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,910
introduce cyber to newbies

263
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,370
I consider myself

264
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,550
you still hopefully it's 40 cents that's

265
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,690
why it's great I mean hopefully you'll

266
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,810
see some of these news I hope you're

267
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,810
watching

268
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,130
but the only thing is look at these

269
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,110
majors sociology management philosophy

270
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,230
all these folks are bad for science we

271
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,730
must play its Bachelor of Science in

272
00:15:49,230 --> 00:16:16,540
philosophy it's great right Bachelor of

273
00:15:51,730 --> 00:16:21,130
Science in language I published and then

274
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:24,219
two years ago my second cohort looking

275
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:27,790
at hollowing best employee of psycho

276
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,120
reserve force the cyber insurance really

277
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,120
exists

278
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,930
no how do we do offensive cyber

279
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,240
operations hope they burn that money

280
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:46,479
integrate only cyber forces for a new

281
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,310
website warfare and then how do we

282
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:58,270
counter violent extremist organizations

283
00:16:48,310 --> 00:17:02,530
in and the great thing with this last

284
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:04,270
year our tears ago really I have three

285
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,000
teams that submitted for publication so

286
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,910
team reserves to insurance and team

287
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,329
because of the team local team officer

288
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:18,820
several operations during those papers

289
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:21,689
are in publication are preprocessor and

290
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,270
just a closer look at one of the team's

291
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,980
most amazing and the themes are very

292
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,650
similar to all the teams because we were

293
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,690
giving them a process please to take on

294
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,950
so we're looking at Enid Connor why

295
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,110
extremist organizations again 298 years

296
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,970
from politics major that was a fight I

297
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,610
was actually surprised I didn't realize

298
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:45,270
I was working with a navy we're not

299
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,250
spies when I saw he see wo for I was

300
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,660
mistaken I thought the steel before so I

301
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,280
thought it's been learning on but again

302
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,830
it is a joint organization at CENTCOM

303
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,160
and we're actually that's more dangerous

304
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,389
we make up pictures they were very nice

305
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,630
so the initial problem statement that

306
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:03,270
this year before writing Club came up

307
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,070
with is very right a very vague

308
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,290
statement but the big is nice I think

309
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,909
that's made is nice because are there

310
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,159
problems to figure out how that comes

311
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,980
off mission statement to something they

312
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,170
can work on and so what the cadets came

313
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,750
up with on their first or second

314
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,550
variations is any transform this into a

315
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,250
wise policy this is some of it they've

316
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:27,030
developed systems I hope event like

317
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,950
panic trends to disrupt these by

318
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,379
extremist groups are using cyber

319
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:35,400
activities that's very moving and

320
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,170
eventually looking came up with whom

321
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,820
they actually did their a project event

322
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,280
came to the write-up was there were

323
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,290
flying poems do you need more they want

324
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,990
to find the best ways Oh technical I'm

325
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:49,409
not technical to counter all these by

326
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:52,080
extremist organizations consignment get

327
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,210
very vague terms but what they do is

328
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,909
they apply essentially quality of an

329
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,680
epoch in which would want a mobile value

330
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,270
model in order to help our car planners

331
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,590
so what they came up with it is a bunch

332
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,270
of values by some value focus Vikki you

333
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,760
might debate you know some of the values

334
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:17,570
that church they have here but it's you

335
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:17,570
know it's not it's not overly complex

336
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,800
they came up with essentially twelve

337
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,200
metrics that you can measure the

338
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,879
effectiveness of the program and the

339
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,780
program and it broke down to technical

340
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,020
non-technical

341
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,610
means

342
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:38,470
and in order to wake these like in order

343
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,990
to wait and stuff picking on 12 he said

344
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,900
she broke it down to like six looks like

345
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,850
yet six from not 12 we pulled out this

346
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,620
the six most important I've discussed

347
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,370
with the client the chief warrant

348
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,750
officer as these are the six most

349
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,909
important and they write court he sent

350
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,170
you right before these from you said she

351
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,560
will one through six and gave him some

352
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,770
plates

353
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,260
why would I went to this time and they

354
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,300
came up they get using it except right

355
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,830
using Excel the great thing is exile

356
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,020
does this for you right if you do

357
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,020
scatterplot when we wrote the papers if

358
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,149
you don't know accelerate you just put

359
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,920
the data points in Excel you make sure

360
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,570
you scatterplot right Scott ball

361
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,850
function then you find the best fit line

362
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,159
I'll spell the best thing that's being

363
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,959
alignment matches what it thinks is the

364
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,790
best fit through those data points

365
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,590
I liked on my kids right the shape is

366
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,330
the most important thing the shape is

367
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,480
more important upward sloping upward

368
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:38,710
sloping with balance coping with the

369
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:45,430
Domitian returns parabolic so in this

370
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:46,930
case I've seen my desk be these

371
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,190
functions are all straight lines going

372
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,840
upward I know they haven't really

373
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,090
thought too much i jus like when they

374
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,750
give him different shapes because I mean

375
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,470
different shapes are actually competing

376
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:01,570
trails and the mathematical function is

377
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,220
purely a summation of based on the

378
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:10,750
weights that we give to each of these

379
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:12,160
lines value and what's the guest for

380
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,770
this box came with a course of action

381
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,930
right as being wide a technical option

382
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,200
on technical options in the blank use

383
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:22,120
the plan come up has the SD lead as the

384
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,080
winner in this case the blank ink modest

385
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,080
one but the issue

386
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,809
the interesting thing is right we the

387
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,179
mix throughout the blended solution does

388
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,489
come up as do overall high schools or

389
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:39,850
but the interesting thing is now if

390
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:42,799
you're a chief rate most post this tech

391
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,248
varicocele so they're probably on the

392
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,989
right track

393
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:46,909
interesting the newest non tech right

394
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:49,009
we're on the Cuban means this is what I

395
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:51,320
came up with AdWords wrote this or below

396
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,710
us right now this is actually 50% mark

397
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,059
of the ideal line so if insights apart

398
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,100
it's not just that you get a better

399
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:02,299
solution and going to blended but it's

400
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,070
funny if you add value right so our

401
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:09,080
thinking along the right track based on

402
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:11,149
the values that I was interested in now

403
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,158
these are my simple rules so if they're

404
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:14,658
trying to teach new folks while

405
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,429
cybersecurity this is what I recommend

406
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,019
start with the physical security

407
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,840
technology has they know whatever Steve

408
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,919
Deacon along any of his talks he gives a

409
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,779
lot of talks at these service tree

410
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,669
conference to if you haven't seen it I

411
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:28,940
recommend going to just go to youtube

412
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:31,879
and just search for DDA that's as big a

413
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,739
changes name deviant along look for this

414
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:40,158
chocolate fondue like I've seen a couple

415
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:41,929
his it gets pretty graphic he gets his

416
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,549
mom capital gets pretty blogger into a

417
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,700
lot of sauce this is one with more

418
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:50,330
family friendly ones stop the car from a

419
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,249
few years ago just YouTube do a search

420
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,220
for deviant all on shop on because the

421
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:57,200
great thing with his top do you get I

422
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,909
actually saw him he came and gave the

423
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,679
top of network conferences but actually

424
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:03,440
saw him another comfortability he knows

425
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,840
me when I saw his father it crystallizes

426
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,820
cyber school because the great thing is

427
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,220
for every right you don't know deviant

428
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,720
all he's a physical pentester so for

429
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,269
every physical penetration where he

430
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,369
gives you all all his everything that he

431
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:19,669
broke new dude he gives you the 10-cent

432
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:21,289
fix that's the great thing right he just

433
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,690
doesn't tell you how he broke into it

434
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:26,450
and right now what a great job he did he

435
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,029
gives you the 10-cent fix because if you

436
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,980
apply attentive fix like he says the

437
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:32,180
greatest tools that he has when he goes

438
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,100
on cam justice I have

439
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,200
now he doesn't break through the doors

440
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,969
right we know from right from all these

441
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,430
talk to you here right from the from

442
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,020
military analogy perspective again right

443
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,130
let's cyber attackers are doing they're

444
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,560
not going to the front board they're

445
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,790
using back doors they do not go through

446
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,770
the front door because the front door

447
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,389
has different great folks no click locks

448
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,210
man they go through the back doors the

449
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,500
back doors are open so what detail all

450
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,090
I'm telling you the best part you see

451
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,230
does is a near nail and hammer

452
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,260
he doesn't go through the door he takes

453
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:05,960
a nail hammer pops the white is open to

454
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:07,280
go wrong man positive fix to that 10

455
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Center fixes it I'm gonna fix that

456
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,060
you just gonna use a bunch pins take

457
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,100
that go to Home Depot

458
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:34,240
that's why it's a great pop so you give

459
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:34,240
you the kind of easy

460
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,390
I encouraged when I get us to watch

461
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,399
formulas now my boys have already

462
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,710
watched sneakers sneakers

463
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,750
again I do recommend equals is the first

464
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,440
one sneakers and Robert Redford EMC

465
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,210
sneakers

466
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,460
you haven't seen sneakers it's an old

467
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,860
movie Robert Redford Smith he's pretty

468
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,330
old idlies Ben Kingsley is in it I think

469
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,600
it's I think thank him he should have

470
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,330
done

471
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,879
he plays a great diagnolly oh but really

472
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:39,928
all-star cast a very dapper ends in

473
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,670
sneakers is a great movie

474
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,950
if yours if you're starting to learn

475
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,690
about sighs I'm gonna watch TV because

476
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,549
it gives you not just physical pet that

477
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,400
someone TV all along does gives you some

478
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:52,670
cyber time

479
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,890
wargames these two movies are also

480
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,900
popularly featured in Frank captain's

481
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:03,299
book dark territory the secret history

482
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:06,090
of the u.s. soccer community so these

483
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:09,270
two moves are probably matrix you should

484
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:16,740
watch matrix 1 Trinity doesn't use any

485
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:18,900
maps in order to capture and then

486
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:26,340
abilities and then like that's like she

487
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:33,919
gave him a bonus the only one that

488
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:36,299
wasn't present matrix I didn't watch I

489
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,690
don't think melek erman was that good

490
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:41,580
that's pretty good now I also introduced

491
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,350
Podesta to these TED Talks right these

492
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,240
eight one type of presentations are

493
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,620
being imported thanks to a job before

494
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,650
you know I got my visual aids as well so

495
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,600
these these be science talks these Def

496
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,669
Con talks long more importantly they'll

497
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,570
pour all of them but you're not

498
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:02,100
reporting things just do a search from

499
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:07,370
going on right next door about Bitcoin

500
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:10,049
and the blockchain right so just I

501
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,678
encourage my cadets you partner sure of

502
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:16,020
you like watching these videos and then

503
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,549
I also encourage the best incorporate

504
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,020
because I know I'm being custom a little

505
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,129
different disciplines I told me use

506
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,650
their own walls that they learned from

507
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:26,059
their own psychology classes laws that

508
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,059
they learned from their economic losses

509
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,320
and then I possibly this long-form trap

510
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,609
of the

511
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,829
if I I have become more explicit in this

512
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:42,779
because what I found are teams that do

513
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:45,178
well on the ones I don't do don't do

514
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:50,519
much of this so if you saw some of these

515
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:57,959
value measures yeah so you see some of

516
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:59,549
these volume added I see these two of

517
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:01,619
these value measures the number of words

518
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,559
identified by socially the number of

519
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:06,448
acceptors sites data size comprehension

520
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,418
I think they got too technical

521
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:11,279
I think both over but they got cheated

522
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:16,559
the ones that actually did a much better

523
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,289
job it's silver is it faster is it gives

524
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:26,639
more general or generic types of value

525
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:31,589
measures because really this is what is

526
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:33,958
the goal of the entire experience not

527
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:36,809
just my class but the markets earned but

528
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:38,759
particularly particularly for this core

529
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:41,099
engineering sequence lesson systems here

530
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,959
because the reality is right now you're

531
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:45,208
in the low low quality analysis low

532
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:46,679
flood mitigation nineties custody you

533
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:50,699
saw my rossbach you know I like doing

534
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,799
these too much he matrices so right we

535
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:54,629
want our just being right in that hi-hi

536
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,219
area right that quarter in there it's

537
00:28:54,629 --> 00:29:01,049
okay we want them to be in that golden

538
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,089
area because if you're in that low low

539
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,649
area right with President Trump being

540
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:07,609
our current president if you're not

541
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:11,059
loved all areas you're fired

542
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:14,158
find a job now here's the problem if

543
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:17,959
even if you're in this high quality

544
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,959
leadership at low analysis

545
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:24,770
folks we'll figure that the other

546
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,200
problem is also still the hypothesis

547
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,990
below communication skills price lost

548
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,320
opportunity again I've seen it like

549
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:35,690
that's giving presentations but it's

550
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,059
great content but really what we want

551
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,190
them to be as please listen they're

552
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:42,980
concise a local model helps out see

553
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:52,039
neighbors hopeless we're trying to get

554
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:53,390
all the kiss now here are pros about

555
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,679
teaching at a West Point Military

556
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,870
Academy Center

557
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,419
the great thing is we have a career-low

558
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,010
my show that in first few slides for

559
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:02,360
forcing us right so I know what math

560
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,870
course they have it however you have

561
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,428
autistics very half calculus one they

562
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,928
have a technology baseline everything

563
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:11,899
that gets issued the same computer they

564
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:17,360
get to issue the chalice Malvina Apple

565
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:18,709
tablets they know after the record that

566
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,408
we served five years in the military a

567
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:28,520
second thing most likely army some do do

568
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:30,190
a brush transfer now here at Cod there

569
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,389
are some thoughts about teaching

570
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,370
military academy and this is just an

571
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:40,010
inscription that's in our engineering

572
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:42,020
building this bond says that manual

573
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,640
emphasize a theoretical knowledge should

574
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,200
be applied promises that's hope that

575
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,700
people

576
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,110
teacher cadets for assistance program

577
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,390
those are some thoughts

578
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,350
the cons of teaching at any military

579
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,320
academy

580
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,600
you look very similar to the purpose

581
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,230
right the clogs are really them I think

582
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,668
you even though I promote almost none

583
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,649
even though I told you we're trying I'm

584
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:06,980
trying to leverage that multi district

585
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:08,600
aspect of the deaths oh really how very

586
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,789
how much variation you'll really get

587
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,820
that's not a lot cuz I know they're

588
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:15,620
coming from a very standardized back why

589
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,389
you never live on a different discipline

590
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,370
that's okay

591
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:22,750
having all these common things also

592
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:25,250
and decline so I recognize that as well

593
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:29,870
now here's the overall mission of the

594
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:31,910
military academy we're essentially

595
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,719
graduating the use of characters and

596
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,760
preparing them for a career of service

597
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,100
for the US Army for a nation and by

598
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,680
exposing the are at least my cadets to

599
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,850
the cyber security field I think I've

600
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,230
been doing that good morning welcome our

601
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,530
team is trying to learn as well this

602
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,750
notion of challenge our cadets to be

603
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,750
prepared for a complex and uncertain

604
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:56,540
environment and that's really part of

605
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,360
their walk and I was gonna that was very

606
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,490
structured now our cadets do much more

607
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,909
individualized programs we're saying

608
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:07,580
work has to overseas exchange programs I

609
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:11,480
think about Dean said a third of our

610
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:14,570
kids spend at least three weeks abroad I

611
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,160
think that's I think oh I spent 24 years

612
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:29,120
in the military and just gradually the

613
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:32,570
summer and overseas going back as a

614
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,550
cautionary firm conclusion I talk about

615
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,159
what history of warfare how I think of

616
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:40,760
them now the danger is right if we lose

617
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,820
if we lose the Sun whoa you might

618
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,170
contend the Ferrari side war my general

619
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,939
million the army few stuff says we're

620
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:52,340
not however we do believe that if we do

621
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:56,020
fill in wings but now we fill up winning

622
00:32:52,340 --> 00:33:01,159
side work don't we go back to the

623
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:03,830
present and I think that would be very

624
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,690
baffling estimate their routine this and

625
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,620
again a lot of movies that this fill

626
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,960
that up for us

627
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,959
my favorite is pine of the Apes

628
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,439
and here's a quote from I think was

629
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:23,600
achieved - hi spike he's talking about

630
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:28,309
really if you lose this more so that's

631
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:30,678
the cautionary tale and with that

632
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:35,030
concludes my presentation and I will

633
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:47,960
feel any questions we will feel many

634
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:51,830
questions yes yeah so the question is

635
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:54,460
what's the ratio of essentially cuts

636
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,418
that are taking math science engineering

637
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,600
versus humanities

638
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:02,330
well I the nice thing is actually this

639
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,719
study on this I did I have I don't have

640
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:08,509
a recent statistics I have studies going

641
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,220
from five years ago interesting thing is

642
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,500
I actually thought it was much more

643
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:15,908
heavily humanities it breaks up beyond

644
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:18,560
fifty-fifty with 50% humanities essence

645
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:24,889
and that trend has actually been

646
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:26,869
assistant for the past five years but

647
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,240
the reality is I was an economics major

648
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:30,980
they categorize when I was there they

649
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:38,199
categorize economics as math science

650
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:43,969
engineering now economics is but really

651
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:45,379
yes but the great thing is those do you

652
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,600
thought major in mathematics you saw the

653
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:49,429
original how structures everyone's

654
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,889
getting back forces they're getting all

655
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:54,760
they're getting up to Cal Cal to is now

656
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,760
optional

657
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:06,819
does that answer the question yeah

658
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,550
yes the button is do I see the article

659
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,060
culture going more towards sideline less

660
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:47,240
towards infantry I was actually talking

661
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,790
with this this notion of culture with

662
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,109
something during the lunch break and you

663
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:55,450
know there's not this is books that

664
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:55,450
state culture eats strategy every day

665
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,970
but cultures talk there's always going

666
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:03,890
to be a need for infantry that's the

667
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,169
nature of essentially forums where we

668
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,839
fight landowners it's yours

669
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,790
the great thing is that what white horse

670
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:12,859
is doing is it doesn't all good it's

671
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:15,290
like [ __ ] they're none of them was a

672
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:17,299
cyber major all these bits here or at

673
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,940
some ranch monomers are branched all of

674
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,750
them something else because the cyber

675
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,390
crash books

676
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,880
we were very selective every small

677
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:30,049
branch and again very experimental right

678
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:33,980
now that all these cadets you know we

679
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:36,290
have females are no infantry they've

680
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,329
opened up three months two years ago

681
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:41,650
farmers have enough females fuel

682
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,650
artillery has been

683
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,770
so get my health right field artillery

684
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:55,490
oh these are apps in the precious days

685
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:58,460
they're interesting and again none of my

686
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:02,060
test motorcycle is the cyber folks will

687
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:12,640
engineers there are the guys or gals

688
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:12,640
working on us now - I pick for cyber

689
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:23,540
space so the whole notion cyber couple

690
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:29,630
group is fractured three years ago cyber

691
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:31,130
I look at those French leaders go so I

692
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,320
broke the other that's brush three years

693
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,030
ago space might be able to nut so the

694
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,250
notion that we're going towards 21st

695
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,200
century it's you're even like a few

696
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:43,340
folks it's the infantry folks I'm gonna

697
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,319
be populating these new branches right

698
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:48,530
we don't just produce peace officer

699
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,030
don't grow these soldiers same thing

700
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,850
with cyber cycle didn't just grow up

701
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,530
itself cyber was amalgamation of a lot

702
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:57,920
of soldiers from military intelligence

703
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:01,910
signals and then electronic warfare so I

704
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,740
have a lot more salty lot more officers

705
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:07,609
become more engineer for their trip

706
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,560
space of cyber that is opportunity but

707
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,570
even if there's crazy I think this is

708
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,480
the more formal if you're straight into

709
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:16,880
tree really touched by sonic that's why

710
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,910
I think I my classes cognition exposes

711
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,600
it gets that consignment is plumbed up

712
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:26,109
and recently saw the applicability for

713
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,110
their sentence

714
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:39,850
you mentioned that what would make them

715
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,529
successful yeah it's a it's not them

716
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,089
being too technically as bad like it

717
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,310
especially to conflate this right we

718
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,510
actually need very technical folks but

719
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,790
if you look at the folks I would

720
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:52,180
teaching they are coming into the

721
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:55,150
classroom like me I guess I spelled

722
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,850
cyberverse not in the psy right for me

723
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,260
Cybermen launching thing to come to a

724
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,430
conference like this didn't talk you

725
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:09,310
need to attend a conference like this

726
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:10,899
that's not very good si got too

727
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,000
technical for the ones thinking that

728
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,570
happy a technical solution I had to be a

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,850
technical give me number of hits number

730
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,980
of number of kilobytes per site things

731
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,830
like I did not want them back to

732
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,750
especially I told them I had a great

733
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,509
guest lecture this is a public notice

734
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:33,880
rule I got as much as I tell my kids

735
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:35,860
right cautionary tales I've got a guest

736
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,470
lecturer and he gave him the example

737
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,360
this is a navy guy screeches he came

738
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,040
from example see this missionary he gave

739
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,480
me that if you're designing the next

740
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,430
bayonet for your soul you're right for

741
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,440
the 21st century to work what do you

742
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,690
want to be I guess do not want to be

743
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,030
like we wanted to be durable we want to

744
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,700
be lethal we might be sharp we wanted to

745
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,050
be one gets a spike increasing ruin

746
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,890
right I've been thinking about all these

747
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:04,090
things and was there a technical because

748
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:07,120
I thought the perfect example we want

749
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:10,330
solutions that are having values that

750
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,020
appeal to any decision the cinema can

751
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,020
change the values

752
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:52,350
we technically I think it's not probably

753
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,380
cuz I sneeze I actually like one not to

754
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:58,140
give the midgets that easier I think as

755
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,450
long as certain it can analyze if they

756
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,980
can analyze and use some numbers to back

757
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,259
it up that's why we we emphasize

758
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,330
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet long

759
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,160
especially model with this simple

760
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,650
project right we incorporate accession

761
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,910
of a lot of things going to do whatever

762
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,960
they're doing regression without them

763
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,020
knowing lot like getting a best

764
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,390
appliance is doing right there you see

765
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,720
elephants treating that wants to at

766
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,220
least come up with a quantitative

767
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,569
measure not just a qualitative they're

768
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,580
actually doing both of us

769
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:30,060
but we're trying to get them focus on

770
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:32,190
using quantitative variables because I

771
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:37,370
think it's easier for decision makers

772
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,370
it's hard for the suit makers to remit

773
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,259
based analysis

774
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,250
any other questions again I'm here for

775
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:55,920
the rest of the afternoon I'll plug it

776
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,890
clean long time defending champion I am

777
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,599
the white black badge holder from last

778
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,598
year so hopefully if you
