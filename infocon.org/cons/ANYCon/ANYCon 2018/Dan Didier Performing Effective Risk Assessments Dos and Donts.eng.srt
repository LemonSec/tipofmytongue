1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,149
alright hello everybody today does

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,349
anyone want to do this for me yeah so

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,870
there's only a quiz for people in the

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:17,009
back row everyone else you're safe

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,990
my name is Dan I believe that risk

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,730
management is one of the most important

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,209
things for anyone in cybersecurity to

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,130
know not only what it is about how to do

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,750
if you don't know this you will not be

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,129
as successful as you would be otherwise

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,840
I guarantee it so let's start this all

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:40,469
gifts get started I'm trying to describe

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:01:05,850
computer security all right down

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:01:08,159
frustrating and the only the same thing

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,530
and that's a big problem it's

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,909
frustrating to the business it's

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,380
frustrating to me and it's frustrating

18
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,000
to you have you ever been in a

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,580
conversation with someone right you're

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,090
just not this is a big problem this is

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,619
huge and they're just they're lost right

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,100
they don't understand it they don't

23
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,409
believe you so risk management helps us

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,229
get over those hurdles no matter what

25
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,720
part of the business or cybersecurity

26
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,009
you're operating I'm gonna talk about

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,270
this today some of its going to be a

28
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,460
little boring we're going to give you a

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,369
9-step process but I'm going to talk

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,789
about this in real terms my experiences

31
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,979
and if you have any questions about what

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,689
I'm saying or think I'm talking

33
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,210
just let me all right quick I'm great

34
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,199
Castle I think our vision statement is

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,080
absolutely perfect and I believe that

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,970
this is not

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,480
for us and Nene look a lot of those out

38
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:08,750
here cybersecurity needs to be relevant

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,150
practical and effective all the time

40
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,080
think about this blue collar secure it

41
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,290
can't be complex

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,280
it can't be technology driven it has to

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,780
be driven by the business so one of the

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,190
goals that I like is it needs to be as

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,970
simple as possible without being too

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:32,990
simple that's really our target yes

47
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:35,360
horses so for me this is about knowing

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,730
what I have and what its values because

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,830
this fence right here might cost more

50
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,540
than the horses is protected and that's

51
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,400
not a good situation we see this a lot

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,280
especially the technology we offer

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,990
solutions to solve problems just cost

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,260
way too much but I think about from

55
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,510
business terms as a bad thing so what I

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,250
have to do is not build a hundred fence

57
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,890
around ten dollars and that's a little

58
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,520
risk management helps us do so people

59
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:09,410
were very very very bad they don't

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:11,830
disagree so technology is you give me

61
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,829
one second

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:35,390
all right horses very so you always

63
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,840
think and communicate security and

64
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,269
business terms period and I'm here to

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,160
talk about how we do that do we spend

66
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,420
too much on this fence this bar wall

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,609
this endpoint protection of this

68
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,899
encryption yadda yadda where do we spent

69
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,850
the right amount for what we're

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,560
protecting because you can absolutely

71
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,450
secure the business to the point where

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,260
the business can no longer exist and

73
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,260
that's a bad thing right

74
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:03,100
this is going to happen we get hacked

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:08,330
every business as it says how do we know

76
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,340
that this issue is something that was

77
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,780
avoidable or not and how much time and

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,790
money should we spend on avoidance

79
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,300
because undoubtedly this will happen and

80
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,469
the impact might vary greatly so for us

81
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,780
determining how much time and money to

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,790
spend should be directly related to what

83
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,219
the potential impacts of businesses if I

84
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,660
do or don't do that and letting the

85
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,640
business decide what that's worth

86
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,220
because they know what the value of

87
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:36,560
their assets are their products their

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,540
processes their people this is really

89
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,070
frustrating I have all of this is moving

90
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,070
on my screen or not on sp

91
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,230
[Music]

92
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,800
one more time

93
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,789
this is a example of Chris manager right

94
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,860
here right I would do this three times

95
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:11,860
made sure it worked in the Lord now

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,849
because I can go on to beat us all day

97
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,080
about this stuff these sliders for you

98
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,819
they're going to feel good that I know

99
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,000
what I'm talking yeah you kind of rework

100
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:29,750
your incident response plan yeah I have

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,909
a USB Drive original but this here's a

102
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,819
short list of things you may not have to

103
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,560
comply with yeah yeah a short list my

104
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,210
crank this out about 60 seconds things I

105
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,840
know I'm sure you've got to know a lot

106
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,150
more but all of these you know the

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,960
common thread is they were partners

108
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,780
meant and not just you know we build a

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,620
spreadsheet with yellow read read but

110
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,690
actual risk management process so let's

111
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,409
talk about major failure risk management

112
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,870
so anyone want to say this as you know

113
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:05,690
live right at the first turn what this

114
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,610
is risk management there was this huge

115
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,560
defensive position Bill after World War

116
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,159
one right front so we do not want this

117
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,639
to happen again and they built the most

118
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,259
technologically advanced bunker

119
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,000
reinforced system underground tunnels in

120
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:25,819
the world I have the same head hair

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,039
industry and it was built to defend

122
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:31,940
against what they learned in World War

123
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:38,229
one guess what it failed on World War

124
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:41,479
two 20-some odd years later so why did

125
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:43,969
technology advanced right we went from

126
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,789
having your little you know slowly

127
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:49,090
moving mechanized things all of those

128
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:51,310
tanks to having these fast moving

129
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,830
and airplanes and all these things that

130
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,990
they didn't consider so this line was

131
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,870
built to block any entrance where they

132
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,340
thought the existing shearing and what

133
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,770
we could get through and it wasn't

134
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,969
update it to address with a new truck if

135
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,820
al is right but this is what we deal

136
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,010
with the same problem so really the

137
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,930
question is why should you care why

138
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,000
should I care but really it's no matter

139
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,290
what your position of wool is whether

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,780
you're the CEO

141
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,180
even for make some security officer or

142
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,940
you're a junior

143
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,530
technical specialist understanding and

144
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,600
using risk to communicate with the

145
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:34,510
business to build an effective strategy

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:36,760
is Pro it's the only way so you have to

147
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,260
avoid jargon technical terms that quite

148
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,840
honestly just make people glaze over

149
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,690
instantly but most important you know

150
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,210
about risk though is if you make a bad

151
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:49,150
decision or make a recommendation that

152
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,120
turns out to be really bad imagine why

153
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,479
is that your fault

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,850
absolutely if you follow a somewhat

155
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,860
standardized risk management process the

156
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,330
business understands you are building in

157
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,700
the festival position because you did

158
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,669
not make that decision the business made

159
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,770
the decision with no matter where you

160
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,889
are on the spectrum in that corporate

161
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,700
ladder that is gold so you need to

162
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,280
protect yourself

163
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,740
also this builds a defensible position

164
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,989
for your company right so why do we do

165
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,450
this that's a big reason another reason

166
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,950
because you have to most of the

167
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,539
regulations I just put up there don't

168
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,550
say do this if you want to you're

169
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,289
required to do it and if I think about

170
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,090
what the impacts of not doing that are

171
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,039
its significant and today is getting

172
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,468
more significant monetary fines are

173
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,370
escalating the impacts that businesses

174
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,459
relocations

175
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,440
are escalating also you don't have on

176
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,539
the dollars to spend so you can't just

177
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,060
solve every surgery issue and risk

178
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,270
management helps you with that they're

179
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,959
never done this

180
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,790
there's no editing leader Evelyn period

181
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:57,209
there's no enemy completely compliant

182
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,770
ever period we have to think about what

183
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:00,869
is the best way to get me to the best

184
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,790
result and that's what risk management

185
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,100
calls us to do if you think technology

186
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,599
will solve all your problems both our

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,610
peoples are getting hacked every day our

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,510
organization is still having huge impact

189
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,830
absolutely

190
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,649
you think that's the next-gen firewall

191
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,050
probably a few of them so we need to

192
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,450
learn to manage for risk we need to

193
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:22,709
learn to manage security but do four

194
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,300
most important issues and gas first this

195
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,640
is absolutely true people do not make

196
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:32,750
the decisions right so we've evolved

197
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,750
over millennia technology just started

198
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,640
and I'll give you a great example

199
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,310
I'll give you an option you still stand

200
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,630
next to a few vending machines or you

201
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:47,060
can get in the pool there's a pool over

202
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:49,589
here behind the wall the sharks use that

203
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,869
statistics tell me that I'm most more

204
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,520
likely to get seriously hurt or killed

205
00:09:51,870 --> 00:10:06,930
by the understand I've done my live

206
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:12,000
shows but you the person will not and

207
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:14,040
but our rings a long time we did not

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,420
know all the technology it's gonna take

209
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,130
a long time for us to be able to manage

210
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,209
that risk effectively and quite honest I

211
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,279
don't think we'll ever be able to do it

212
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,930
because of the complexity of it the rate

213
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,089
at which it's growing and our inability

214
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,849
to compute if I seal there it's angry

215
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,730
it's pretty easy everyone away right

216
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,930
when I go on the internet honey bear

217
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,430
there's a lot and you're not gonna run

218
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,790
away in fact you're gonna jump right in

219
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,709
so we are not good at making decisions

220
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,660
around risk especially in relation to

221
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,729
technology and complex business

222
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,069
environments no one person here has all

223
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,089
the information or abilities do that so

224
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,680
we need a process yes right so you

225
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,870
should ask everyone you worked with

226
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,810
because this is an option do you want to

227
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,420
be compliant or do you want to be secure

228
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,388
because they're not the same the first

229
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,439
day

230
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,180
they're not the same thing about how

231
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:04,069
option that's scary

232
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,258
what do you need but this is the point

233
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,868
and risk management helps us make the

234
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:10,879
right decisions to decide how to imply

235
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:13,279
you want to be and how secure we want to

236
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,389
be how much money go spend on one or the

237
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,389
other how much time and effort

238
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,769
okay so evidence when we fail so if it

239
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,269
wasn't get example why because they

240
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:28,069
comically shame basically everybody so

241
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,290
it's very valuable because they share

242
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,519
all of the breached reporting that they

243
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,349
do and they get really valuable

244
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,809
information well three of the four

245
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,929
resolutions die I just pulled up

246
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:41,029
recently here's what happened they

247
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,649
didn't do it back to Princess them guess

248
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,709
what from a compliance perspective

249
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,389
that's a big no-no why because that's

250
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,859
the first thing you're supposed to do if

251
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,050
you have an issue in the August come in

252
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,240
they say Oh show us your top risk items

253
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,339
and then show us what you did to fix

254
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,679
that video I don't really know what

255
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:00,050
you're talking about you're done you're

256
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,519
cooked if you don't do these things not

257
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,529
only is it bad for compliance both

258
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,499
battery program so one thing I will say

259
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,809
is that in the process of actually being

260
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:10,999
compliant a lot of these compliance regs

261
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:12,230
understand that risk management is one

262
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:15,379
of the most important things so they're

263
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,970
not going to tell you what to do and how

264
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:18,290
to do a specifically for your business

265
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,499
in your environment but they are going

266
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,300
to tell you to look at the controls the

267
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:26,059
general controls that they publish and

268
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,439
what analyze that reference to your

269
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:35,029
business and decide which are the most

270
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:36,769
important okay anything any map no I get

271
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:38,749
pretty worked up about this because I

272
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:41,709
see a lot of businesses wasting a lot of

273
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:46,279
time money is our job to prevent that

274
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:50,268
service matter so let's really get dry

275
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,290
and find this per NIST is the total

276
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,150
process of identical

277
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:57,380
controlling and mitigating information

278
00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:01,750
system related it's a key term crisis so

279
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:04,070
everyone knows what to do now okay so

280
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,610
this isn't the only standard there's

281
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,830
others

282
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,780
there's ISO 27000 five and other risk

283
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,760
risk management methodologies that all

284
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,880
pretty much do the same thing they have

285
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,710
some different perspectives some

286
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,870
different options for us but they

287
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,720
generally work and they all do this

288
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,510
three things first thing we do is

289
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,420
evaluate our business against those

290
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,670
controls short this thank you really

291
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,860
then we say all right of all the apps

292
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,949
that we have what are the most impactful

293
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,710
to my business what is going to cause me

294
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,080
the most harm now what is the coolest

295
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,580
technology certainly I like technology

296
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,310
but maybe the most significant control

297
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,870
yeah or risk that I have is that you

298
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:53,300
know what I don't have an instant

299
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:55,070
response plan so make one or maybe it's

300
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,719
you know under access control process on

301
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,570
our customer database doesn't give us

302
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,220
the abilities you in it customer access

303
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,640
from other records and they know how

304
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,590
together that could be a tough race the

305
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,199
point is what I do to resolve those or

306
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,490
vastly different and I can communicate

307
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,500
to the business really clearly they

308
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,750
won't understand like I said they might

309
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,720
have some questions but once I know what

310
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,790
those gaps are sorry I mean not next

311
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,970
time of course that's not he's either

312
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,949
but we'll work through that so no little

313
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,330
hundred offense wrong $10 of course how

314
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,970
do I do this there's three things I care

315
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,930
about cyber security a lot of people

316
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,880
ignore two of these which is dangerous

317
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:39,079
confidentiality integrity availability

318
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:41,630
CIA triad I'd like to talk about this a

319
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,190
little bit because a lot of people think

320
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,680
cyber security is just confidentiality

321
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,210
right traditionally been breached was

322
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,500
any data's lost

323
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,230
that's confidentiality I didn't maintain

324
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,530
confidentiality my culture

325
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,240
client dater my own data whatever it is

326
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:59,819
or any data that's regulated under legal

327
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,770
standards recently luckily you

328
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:06,190
availabilities become fronts I don't

329
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:07,720
even know what drop availability right

330
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,760
summer this is a really effective

331
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,850
confidentiality as it says you no longer

332
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,310
have access to your data sorry cyber

333
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,820
security issue

334
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:20,260
yeah right and integrity good example

335
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,300
let's say you go to the emergency room

336
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,970
bump your batter got bit by a shark

337
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,849
whatever and they pull your metal record

338
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,200
and it's all wrong

339
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,760
that's an integrity issue common

340
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,210
tactical is that you get to long

341
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,569
medication or they are me that's a big

342
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,540
deal

343
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,310
these three factors are significant to

344
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,810
businesses as well because quite

345
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,949
honestly if your information systems

346
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,630
have zero availability you're on

347
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:51,670
business how that happened matter that's

348
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:54,820
key back to how I determine risk okay

349
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,670
balancing those is the heart and we have

350
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,710
to have some sort of process to get our

351
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:05,050
brains out of shark bear vending machine

352
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:08,820
land and into business so the good news

353
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,780
is that's you can never have noticed and

354
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,070
I'm sure everyone's heard this the

355
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,650
second you open business you have press

356
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,540
you will always have rustic he is having

357
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,550
an acceptable level of risk

358
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,370
now how many businesses do you think are

359
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,109
truly comfortable with their level of

360
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,720
risk in cybersecurity do you think you

361
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,150
understand it I don't think so

362
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,730
I don't think we have given those

363
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,269
stakeholders or senior managers the

364
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,699
visibility

365
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:38,399
and they're not sure I asked for you so

366
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,349
even if you do a really good risk

367
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,839
assessment you've evaluated all the

368
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,079
controls there and you've done some

369
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,149
mitigation there will always be risk and

370
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,819
one option in the risk management

371
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:54,050
process is to accept risk bad you have

372
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:56,610
to set the right level okay and

373
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,699
obviously I must have one use other

374
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:03,629
dollars so who wants it

375
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:05,480
how many times I said was no 100 they

376
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:09,589
don't want to find what it actually is

377
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:14,069
and what risk management is it's hard

378
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,730
but it's the potential it's not what

379
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,789
happened

380
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,529
it's the potential of exposure loss or

381
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:24,829
corruption of something or anything

382
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:24,829
about it pretty good right

383
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,870
risk management is an intentional

384
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,090
interaction without three so we're going

385
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,000
to put our thinking caps on area all the

386
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,039
things that could happen now let's try

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,070
to prevent those or at least do some

388
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:45,149
things that reduce what the likelihood

389
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,029
impact of that occur and by the way it

390
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:53,428
applies to all aspects of the business

391
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:56,880
people process and technology anywhere

392
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:59,549
the curse of knowledge this is something

393
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,309
that I talk about a lot obviously the

394
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:05,460
people on my team certainly with folks

395
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,840
that we work with various businesses the

396
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,029
curse technologists are talking to the

397
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,850
bias that you all have you know too much

398
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:13,740
and when you try to communicate to

399
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:18,779
people and don't know as much as you

400
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:20,580
guess what they don't get it and you

401
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,620
know when this is happening when you

402
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,720
find yourself repeating the same darn

403
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,239
thing three four or five times and you

404
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,880
still be like digging it that's your

405
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,549
fault not theirs you have to be aware of

406
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,860
this and you have to find a way to talk

407
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:38,870
in lots of common terms risk

408
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,209
but risk management could also be

409
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,469
greatly thrown off traffic you're not

410
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,420
aware of this so respected 101 the good

411
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,570
news you do not have to invent this

412
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,550
process it exists and there are

413
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,590
standards that you can reference now if

414
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,830
you do invent your own process and you

415
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,389
have a breach and you're a covered

416
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,500
entity under HIPAA or some other

417
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,850
regulation and the others come in to

418
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,970
spend a good with some stuff in a law

419
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:11,389
you guys don't work no not that would be

420
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,580
really smart to do and probably make

421
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,450
very people there are standards to help

422
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,710
us do this

423
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,210
you do have to select the right

424
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,920
standards in some cases the right

425
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,070
standards have been selected for you

426
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,070
depending on your industry or business

427
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,169
you know NIST 853 as a government

428
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,450
focused standard that has been expanded

429
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,760
to many businesses because is all

430
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,840
encompassing so you have to be careful

431
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,810
to select the right controls

432
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,399
there's ISO 27000 right which is more of

433
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,960
an international standard so if my

434
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,100
business does does a lot of

435
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,710
international business I'm probably

436
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,639
gonna let it out and then doing risk

437
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,110
management so these are control the res

438
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,360
management pieces are standard without

439
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,330
as well of miss and I still have good

440
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,370
standards this is how simple it should

441
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:01,070
just redundant behavior yes

442
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:05,419
colors green yellow and right high

443
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:07,840
medium low risk is the easiest thing

444
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:14,270
ever it's just a calculation is

445
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:16,429
probability times in fact the hard part

446
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,590
is agreeing on what the actual

447
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,710
probability and impact is and to do that

448
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:26,840
we need someone else thank you Miss

449
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:29,090
thank you guys so also this I will

450
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,209
caution everybody civil to the curse of

451
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,560
knowledge has anyone ever heard there's

452
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,210
a lot of low-hanging fruit they're

453
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,539
listed

454
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,710
the way getting a starting because

455
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:42,309
that's a bad idea

456
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,350
why you spend all of your time money on

457
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:49,509
the language through wish to be number

458
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:52,509
999 on the risk scoring was that a good

459
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:56,139
use of your time you still have Maggie

460
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,980
high level risk that you but someone

461
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:59,019
else did it

462
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,110
I've done this before there's this new

463
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:04,389
technology yada yada guess what that's

464
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,008
how you get in trouble using risk

465
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,418
management helps you avoid this concept

466
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,740
in fact telling people that you

467
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:11,139
understand that especially in the

468
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,429
business will help you a lot the whole

469
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,199
point is to prioritize the most

470
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:16,330
important things I don't care if it's oh

471
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,740
I can't read or not now some pieces

472
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,678
they're lying fruit that is all

473
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,679
important awesome let's do it just don't

474
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,379
say another thing that's really

475
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,710
important it's already complex now by

476
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:30,939
pologize but for me this is good because

477
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,230
everyone in this room has a little bit

478
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,850
of a different perspective about what

479
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,970
this risk thing is in relation to what I

480
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,219
do do I focus on technology do I focus

481
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,669
on business process or do I put this on

482
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:46,480
the strategy at the organization those

483
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,220
are three known categories that apply of

484
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,899
risk management and we talk about those

485
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,330
in different ways so whether I'm doing a

486
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:54,639
contest and I have produced a list of 12

487
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,490
really really critical gaps in a

488
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:59,019
specific asset or technology or whether

489
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,700
I go into a business and assess their

490
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:03,009
governance process and say you know this

491
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,360
is pretty bad I can apply risk manager

492
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:06,279
to that and communicate back to the

493
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,258
business at the right level using this

494
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,559
process so we think about the strategic

495
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:13,210
business or system or application risk

496
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,200
and it's really important to keep that

497
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,519
straight in your mind

498
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,739
so that you're communicating with people

499
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:23,679
they know what level the organization

500
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:25,869
are coming in up okay so this is not my

501
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,269
feet work but you're not neutral this is

502
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:30,189
the key and it's another key point of

503
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:32,230
risk imagine is it makes it a business

504
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,720
process no one person is making the

505
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,639
decision for the rest of the people are

506
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,159
trying to force their view on somebody

507
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:44,859
the business decides what those risks

508
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:46,149
are now if you were wrong you're

509
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:48,309
basically saying this will be to do

510
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:51,668
trust me I know what I'm doing

511
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,440
Plus buy the stuff let's do this if we

512
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:55,389
do it right it is the business as a

513
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,869
whole and grief on what those topple

514
00:22:55,389 --> 00:23:01,090
items are all right step 1 a versa

515
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:03,749
management is risk assessment let's jump

516
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,519
into this there's nine distinct steps

517
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:10,330
nine things for actually to think about

518
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:14,950
doing LP was organized and it is used to

519
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:17,619
determine potential press number when I

520
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,440
say you know interaction with uncertain

521
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:24,009
time whole price and what their risk

522
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,379
level is and the output of that is to

523
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:28,779
used to identify appropriate controls

524
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:31,209
now when you tell me there's a huge risk

525
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,190
I'm gonna do this a little bit they say

526
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,659
that's right what what are our options

527
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,299
because there's gonna be more than one

528
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:41,830
most likely and then the output of this

529
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:43,899
is intended throat of business step one

530
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,649
we need to we need to agree on what the

531
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:49,330
SCOTUS if you're talking about all the

532
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:52,299
technical assets and I'm talking about

533
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,820
all of our physical locations processes

534
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:56,950
we use secure access we're on the same

535
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,840
page if we want to talk about this one

536
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,100
location or one part of the business we

537
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,770
have

538
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,350
real whatever it is is it a hardware

539
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,780
software is it good we partner with is

540
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,090
the people around people what's our

541
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,379
mission and what data that we have I'm

542
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,539
gonna joke right of that because

543
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,210
honestly nobody would be here right now

544
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:18,240
if there wasn't data this is what drives

545
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:22,770
everything we do in cybersecurity no

546
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,080
didn't go right so to do a really good

547
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,809
risk assessment you have to know what

548
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,000
your assets are and in in our world the

549
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:31,770
asset is data and if we don't have some

550
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,190
sort of simple inventory you understand

551
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:38,549
what assets we have data assets and who

552
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:42,049
owns them then we have a problem because

553
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:46,820
I can't effectively talk about this

554
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:52,940
couple examples does anyone think that

555
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:55,950
IT owns all data oh yes I see those data

556
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,020
some people that might surprise the data

557
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,880
IT insists as a service provider to the

558
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,650
business the business owns the data

559
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,000
specifically in the form of business

560
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:07,500
units finance

561
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,539
they own a human resources they sales

562
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,120
and business development client lists

563
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:14,850
about research and development about

564
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,760
product development they all did

565
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,230
IT just moves it around students versus

566
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,520
owners are two very different things and

567
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,320
when I want to talk about risk I

568
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,030
understand where that it is and who owns

569
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,899
it so they can talk about what the

570
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:31,620
impacts of all these gaps are you need

571
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,470
an inventory step two now that I think

572
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,689
about what I'm going to look at what the

573
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,909
data is that's involved now I need to

574
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,429
identify the threats to the organization

575
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,140
based on a number of things things like

576
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:43,670
past security violations that's a good

577
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,280
way

578
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,420
I haven't already happened things that

579
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,710
happen in the industry

580
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,680
breakin some people have seen this

581
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,350
before ask them what happens the media

582
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,020
write the news video we've from what's

583
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,399
happening elsewhere and then once we put

584
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,560
all of those things together was

585
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,120
churning what are our threats that we

586
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:07,280
need to classify them and there's really

587
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:11,929
three main buckets is natural its

588
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:15,800
environmental cooling system or its

589
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:18,370
human a lot of our customers and by the

590
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:23,450
way does it have to be malicious

591
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:25,790
no I accidentally deleted yeah my

592
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,810
availability is zero that just happened

593
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:32,110
I didn't there were good intentions but

594
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,360
they didn't really do good North Africa

595
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,429
so we have does anyone still believe

596
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,929
that users of the weakest link I have a

597
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:43,100
that we can talk about that later

598
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:45,350
you're gonna fight there's no see but

599
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:49,510
users right certainly our work force

600
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:53,540
introduces risk and we are responsible

601
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:56,210
so step three now that I thought about

602
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,490
the threats are now I can talk about

603
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,750
what are the vulnerabilities so I can

604
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,160
give you some examples here but we do

605
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,690
this in a lot of ways you know ulnar

606
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,400
ability scan penetration testing

607
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,650
absolutely does we've got more abilities

608
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,290
but what I'm an asset an application or

609
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:13,799
system what about vulnerabilities in my

610
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:16,750
people well I do social engineering test

611
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,299
people forward about owner abilities in

612
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,100
my business process you know what we

613
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:23,950
don't really give a crap who gets domain

614
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,510
admin that's a big problem and I've

615
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,990
nothing to do with my assets or

616
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:30,370
technology it has to do that process

617
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,500
from there once I know what all those

618
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,449
gaps are whether they're human or

619
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,950
physical or environmental and whether

620
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,860
they apply to my technology or my

621
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,370
business process for my people what are

622
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,809
the experts so I'm gonna use an analogy

623
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:48,070
about a house here wrap this all up

624
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:50,290
later but you know if I if I come to the

625
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,210
opinion a very important control for a

626
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,480
house is to have a roof and there's a

627
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:57,790
hole in the roof what are the throats

628
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,360
rain is a threat a plane right what

629
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:07,000
about small animals sure what are this

630
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,709
big enough for a very cold warm rain

631
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,720
force all these all these different

632
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,980
threats that have a hole now I have all

633
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,320
these things I have to talk about I

634
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,410
guarantee you there's a lot of work the

635
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,780
more gas you have a person or policy so

636
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:22,360
we use some simple things like this

637
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,370
chart to help us through keep our jobs

638
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,820
organized and your what are the threats

639
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:29,379
terminate employees right you gave them

640
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:34,260
all the madmen you didn't remove it when

641
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:37,260
they left so now fire unauthorized users

642
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:41,410
want to and it was the owner ability

643
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:47,140
well in fire our fire suppression

644
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:51,070
controls are not and let's the exploit

645
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,140
well they're they're either they fail or

646
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,629
maybe don't like the red button shut up

647
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:59,160
our basic urgency as I'm going to see

648
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,560
those in a bad spot you know that is it

649
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,620
threat and then what happens the impact

650
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,960
Center off now I can talk about oh

651
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,719
that's a reasonable way to fix that some

652
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,760
of these are a lot easier as you can see

653
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,650
some of them are really hard so now the

654
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,560
other the control so after we've come up

655
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:18,450
with this list of problems and what can

656
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,360
be used actually now I'm gonna signal

657
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:26,010
what controls do you have you're gonna

658
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:28,169
get a tarp on three we're good okay rain

659
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,210
may be adorable is that tarp out if

660
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,570
there's a hailstorm right or snow or ice

661
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,450
or the bear maybe it works in some cases

662
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,950
they're not all somebody has a plastic

663
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,340
cover on the right bottom or the other

664
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,620
side panels for sure those are examples

665
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,010
of controls that help to lock control at

666
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,719
risk so we need to do this fog level of

667
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,910
technical controls and non-technical

668
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,500
many of alluded to these already you

669
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,690
know access control process itself

670
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,710
absolutely on technical I authorize you

671
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,870
know someone's manager I might offer

672
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,670
either one they can get access to maybe

673
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,310
we have a standard set of access for

674
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:06,080
roles but then do unique requests having

675
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:08,450
the approved individually that's a

676
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,060
little background choice for your place

677
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:15,600
great thank you literals are walls in a

678
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,980
virus endpoint protection all this so we

679
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,110
think about these as preventative

680
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,210
controls or protective controls how do

681
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,669
you think about what controls are

682
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:27,090
corrected and that helps us to put this

683
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:30,510
all in perspective so as we move to the

684
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,949
next steps we don't argue right we've

685
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,710
already agreed look I'm gonna

686
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:39,030
spreadsheet no really clear is this know

687
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:42,390
that control right somebody thought it

688
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,920
was let's put up this game what about

689
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,420
this no stupid

690
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,130
we do this stuff every day in more

691
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,690
complex lives we all ask about this but

692
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,780
I can laugh the same about other stuff

693
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:57,630
we can all right so step 5 how likely is

694
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:01,710
this happen are there bears where I live

695
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,539
no great why do we talk about well done

696
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:09,389
right but

697
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:11,460
it's very unfortunate lottery so as I

698
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:13,830
move through this process now that I've

699
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,600
identified what could happen now all I

700
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,269
really care about is how lately does it

701
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,418
happen we're getting to that easy

702
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:23,009
calculation and that we're gonna chart

703
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,359
give ourselves some good guidance that

704
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:27,080
we can all go back to when you start to

705
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:30,359
argue I mean you know we all get that I

706
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,418
looked based on these like hot dry

707
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:36,779
sources highly motivated hungry angry

708
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:38,849
bear and so physically capable in

709
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:42,359
controls to prevent the vulnerability

710
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:43,918
from exercise are ineffective everybody

711
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,570
it's a good definition of high

712
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,929
likelihood of that happening I'm really

713
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,080
hungry

714
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:50,879
that part was not going to give me out

715
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,889
and then we go down and we use equally

716
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:56,939
useful definitions to keep us all on the

717
00:31:52,889 --> 00:32:01,559
same page great I said there were nine

718
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:04,229
steps right so moving on to how I

719
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,330
actually determine the risk I've done

720
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:07,590
the initial analysis I feel pretty good

721
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,509
they're all on the same page

722
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,189
how likely all these things that happen

723
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,479
and it's you need to meet every business

724
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,429
is different this is the problem you

725
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:17,009
can't just do this those little robot

726
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:18,749
people process and Technology are all

727
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:21,989
different in every business even if

728
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:25,739
you're directing runners so step six

729
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:30,210
determine the adverse impact of a

730
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:32,970
vulnerability confidentiality integrity

731
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,009
and availability the impact is a loss of

732
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,470
us that's all we talk about is I lose

733
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:41,519
confident child I lose integrity I lose

734
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:44,759
availability now when I think about this

735
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,149
as the impact well let's use some real

736
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:52,320
examples rents online let's see in fact

737
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:53,789
what you guys said it depends do you

738
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,139
have a way to recover your assets

739
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:59,669
quickly or did the red somewhere also

740
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:01,738
encrypt your online backups which we're

741
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:03,809
really also Moneyball down as a fast you

742
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:06,769
know tapes anymore but now it's

743
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:06,769
encrypted you don't have to

744
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:15,240
or you can go to there what happens

745
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:19,300
little berries in your house right so

746
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,790
impact this is now focused on and one

747
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,889
thing that I I don't like to turn pro

748
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,629
tab but one thing that I tell people to

749
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,580
do is once you got through that person

750
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,190
through those first five steps everyone

751
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,830
talked about likelihood agreed on the

752
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,740
vulnerability drop hairs forget about it

753
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,689
all I want to know now is how how what

754
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,890
is the impact of that because what

755
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,600
people start to do is they start to

756
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,160
solve the problem and then you just blew

757
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,110
up the earth management process do not

758
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,620
try to solve problems just tell me very

759
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,510
simply what is the impact if America

760
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:51,100
again you simply use hobby or a load of

761
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,740
tell us what the impact is but in this

762
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,110
case instead of saying it's a highly

763
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,610
motivated intelligent attacker and we

764
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,639
don't have any good controls we run them

765
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:04,060
high means that if that vulnerability is

766
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,130
exploited the result is a very high cost

767
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,920
or loss of tangible assets or resources

768
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,930
to the business and they significantly

769
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,180
by the harm repeat the organization's

770
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,850
mission reputation or interest and in a

771
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:18,100
result in human death fear center so

772
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,069
heís pretty bad that's pretty clear

773
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:24,610
basically the business may go away or

774
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,900
people may die I'm supposed to low if

775
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,890
this happens

776
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:31,930
there's some loss of tangible assets and

777
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,580
it may be noticeably affect the

778
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:37,029
organization is the Maestri reputation

779
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:40,690
or interest but you carry on not going

780
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:45,010
to be just a breeze versus a broken up

781
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:47,889
right that's it just it was Chris

782
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:51,040
Matthew now what we're gonna do is we're

783
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:54,219
gonna take each of those the likelihood

784
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,980
and the impact and consider the controls

785
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:58,480
are you have in place so that we

786
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,950
understand how to reduce the risk and

787
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,240
just multiply them so when I do that I

788
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,810
come up with that chart I showed earlier

789
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,299
and I can talk to the business

790
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,549
in very clear terms now we talked about

791
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,619
impact and we talked about length of it

792
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,560
and we classified those that was just a

793
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,570
guess to this respirator right and

794
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,330
percentage without a 1 to 10 score hello

795
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,240
is maybe one two three and then medium

796
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,819
so in the middle and high of 70 if I was

797
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:34,319
to multiply a tenon for impact as

798
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:35,700
Italian or a one two I could great with

799
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,170
these sort of those from large the

800
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,490
smallest and I think one of the

801
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,650
businesses say hey based on a risk

802
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,430
manager process the definitions that you

803
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:48,390
helped us come up with so with high risk

804
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:51,000
is we have four degrees there's a strong

805
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,618
need for corrective measures an existing

806
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,300
system may continue to operate but a

807
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,130
corrective action that must be put in

808
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,470
place as soon as possible the business

809
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:03,570
told you this happen if we have a high

810
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:05,310
this is what we need to do and that's

811
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,040
what this helps us with probability

812
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:10,440
times attacked so we end up with a nice

813
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,720
clean matrix we can sort risks top to

814
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,220
bottom one of the things that I do is I

815
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,689
promise any business that I do risk

816
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,899
assessment I'll give you a top ten

817
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,550
period not 300-500

818
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,380
certainly there are that many gaps in

819
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,109
their controls either the top ten worst

820
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,380
and by the way I don't tell you what

821
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:27,779
they are

822
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:32,400
I just help you do this magical thing

823
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,839
you tell us what so control

824
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
recommendations now that I got the

825
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,109
fixture and I know there's a top three

826
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,359
or four high risks and some moderate

827
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,920
risks now we can start to talk about

828
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,799
what's writing on timeline hundreds

829
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,740
patent on our mediation and I don't

830
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,690
waste time money more hurt because we're

831
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,759
all on the same page I can do things

832
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,460
like cost out of an analysis I can talk

833
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,089
about the feasibility I can look at it I

834
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,340
have specific minimum levels dictated to

835
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:02,220
me by law to legislation

836
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,470
or what else business partner contracts

837
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,080
as a legal agreement certainly that's

838
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,839
part of the nice and then I talk about

839
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,360
these and form of maybe what is their

840
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,480
policy those are policy needs to change

841
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,160
is that all these do so yesterday we

842
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,860
didn't require a response plan now with

843
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:24,690
you the board agrees yes so the policy

844
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,150
says we'll have it'll say who owns it

845
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:32,850
you know that person will do it but it's

846
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:35,460
not always easy so moving on to step 9

847
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,319
now you can talk to her instead it's

848
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,630
already done for you in most cases you

849
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,390
talk about all the problems we talked

850
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,500
about how likely they are impact

851
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,049
collector they are but the impact would

852
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,240
be you store them or top to bottom base

853
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,800
not risk and you made recommendations in

854
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,319
there on should we change their policies

855
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,640
to change our procedures we do something

856
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,530
with other personnel they do we need

857
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,720
more people we need to train our people

858
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:01,080
should we adjust my facilities we move

859
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,419
that red button somewhere else should we

860
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,759
change their technology and maybe should

861
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,620
we get more insurance so if you think

862
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,840
about this management it's all about

863
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,240
accepting risk or coming up with a way

864
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,620
to make that risk acceptable and some

865
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,359
pieces you can't do any of these

866
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,759
top-line issues and the business may

867
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,620
decide is worth a certain amount of

868
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,570
money to them to go there insurance may

869
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,370
say look we've identified this risk in

870
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,580
our business we cannot solve this now

871
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:28,710
leave right we give us a writer for our

872
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,440
existing policy to help us at this

873
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,570
happens there are insurance companies so

874
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,400
yes they absolutely will and that will

875
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,800
cost a certain amount of dollars the

876
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,780
business a okay is this worth five

877
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:46,020
dollars or is this worth five million

878
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:49,320
dollars to us all right

879
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,060
so recap what are we talking about one

880
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,490
of the boundaries was the scope or the

881
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,700
vulnerabilities or the threats I don't

882
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:59,669
want to care about dress there's no more

883
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:03,538
what existing controls do we have what's

884
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,930
the likelihood of that occur what's the

885
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:09,150
impact it doesn't care multiply those

886
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,700
two together to yours sort those top

887
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,839
bottom top rust on the top everyone

888
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,879
knows what risk means into business

889
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,920
because they've defined it for you you

890
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,839
can talk about reasonable controls those

891
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,450
will cost money or take output and

892
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:24,270
quantify that very easily and I document

893
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:27,390
finding some extra force moment in time

894
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,809
say wow you guys did an awesome job is

895
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:35,000
it not just a couple more things

896
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:46,799
don't ask me of us so hole in our room

897
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:52,079
your house yes anyone else what is your

898
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:58,380
immediate response fix it does anyone

899
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,700
disagree disagree hands up all right

900
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,680
don't you people that are right you

901
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,509
don't fix it why because if your house

902
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,288
looks like this who gives a crap go

903
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:09,210
through there's a tree in your living

904
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:13,140
there's no windows no electricity no

905
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:16,230
heat and quite honestly this is our

906
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:18,660
problem we see an issue and we

907
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:20,450
immediately say how do I fix it and what

908
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,940
do you do you actually start to taste

909
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,839
you just about $20,000 on the roof you

910
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,250
just threw that one away

911
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,970
in fact you make people feel safe

912
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,859
seahorse and avoided the real risk

913
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:36,118
management is designed to avoid thirsty

914
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:39,299
so as people we are super bad trust me

915
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,920
and there's many examples we reach the

916
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:43,980
most by Bruce Schneier he's an awesome

917
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:49,970
explaining the psychology that affects

918
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:53,400
us in this tiny bleach so real quick

919
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:54,808
what is the risk mitigation so so I told

920
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,269
he was gonna tell you about rich man

921
00:40:54,809 --> 00:41:00,959
there's a couple pieces the assessment

922
00:40:57,269 --> 00:41:03,618
now how do we be lovely missus to find

923
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,819
that for me again love those girls

924
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:07,709
prioritizing evaluating implementing the

925
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:09,209
appropriate risk reducing controls

926
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:11,759
recommend from the risk assessment

927
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:13,469
process that's actually not too hard to

928
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:14,939
understand but the translation is how

929
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,650
much time of money should we the

930
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,779
business spends to be reasonably secure

931
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:23,459
that is the translation that is onerous

932
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:30,089
management you see so you know captain

933
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:32,669
risky is yes and people actually be out

934
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:37,409
of the car the cars on two wheels

935
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:49,650
writing it's not a reasonable risk

936
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:52,229
versus reward this guy uses it so I'm

937
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,259
like guarantee you he did some risk

938
00:41:52,229 --> 00:42:00,839
assessment and came up with he's got a

939
00:41:54,259 --> 00:42:03,599
string but it's this it's this you know

940
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,880
it's it this is funny but it's true this

941
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,009
is what we're doing there is a jet

942
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,779
engine coming after you in the form of a

943
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:14,089
cybersecurity threat and you were in

944
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:18,449
that car what do we do do we

945
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:20,669
fireproof suits you know we probably the

946
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:24,299
hospitals so let's let's go through this

947
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:25,859
book this little easier but there's a

948
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:28,529
few things that I think are really

949
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:29,159
really important this is not a technical

950
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:31,669
function at all

951
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:34,140
does anyone got that not that by now

952
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:38,299
this is just about making the business

953
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:42,229
aware allowing them to decide and then

954
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:44,999
giving them visibility to the process so

955
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:47,240
prioritizing our actions so those

956
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:50,569
controls that we decided to put in place

957
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,740
what we learned need to happen so how do

958
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,369
wait what's the order

959
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,810
who's first well probably they try to do

960
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:58,550
the controls for the top risk items

961
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,600
first but interesting story doesn't

962
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,090
always work that way

963
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,529
Kizuna we might have the right resources

964
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,880
we might not have the money right now so

965
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,800
you can't do that for you to go through

966
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,930
and prioritize irradiation the other

967
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,240
thing is it's not a straight line

968
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,460
there's some parallel parallel you know

969
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,500
functionality going on here facilities

970
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,240
is fixing the red body the technical

971
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:23,420
people fix the availability is you look

972
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:25,160
around some are backups sure step 2 we

973
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,990
evaluate those recommending control

974
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,490
options so now it's time to actually do

975
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,419
it right we've been given some options

976
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,640
for controls

977
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,280
now let's you know put the rubber to the

978
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,680
people to go here they make sure they're

979
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,680
reasonable make sure we get all the

980
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,080
details nailed down and then have the

981
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,618
people that know that decision and

982
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:50,390
address all those details step 3

983
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:51,830
what's the cost it is it feasible I go

984
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,150
back to this yeah we did all our

985
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,100
homework you know we got the

986
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,950
recommendations from the risk assessment

987
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,299
group now the technical team came back

988
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,740
said yeah this makes sense here don't

989
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,990
the details we need to worry about here

990
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,589
some cuts out abilities use those total

991
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:08,770
cost of all modules and all the living I

992
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:10,940
give that's what business isn't worth it

993
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:14,869
though a lot of times there's other

994
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:19,869
benefits to say to anybody this

995
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:23,780
so find these selective control step 5

996
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:26,359
critical somebody loans it it's not a

997
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,780
spreadsheet that says you know we're

998
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:32,359
gonna implement this it's a person a

999
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,580
singular person owns that radiation

1000
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:37,810
level there the owner and they will have

1001
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:41,750
help coordinate the Eastfield

1002
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:43,990
it's actually requirement they need to

1003
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,670
have the right knowledge expertise to do

1004
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,910
and then develop the implementation plan

1005
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,460
so document the plan

1006
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:52,980
implementing those controls think about

1007
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,660
what resources priorities and schedules

1008
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,710
need to be put in place and take this

1009
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,279
guy girl go do this moment make it

1010
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,680
happen

1011
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:04,680
by the way these are reports usually go

1012
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,868
before or they want to see what progress

1013
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,669
is what the estimated timeline is the

1014
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,220
next quarter will make it again they say

1015
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:14,190
yeah

1016
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,950
and for another track why not then if

1017
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:19,589
one day controls so certainly this piece

1018
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:22,680
sounds easy but if you don't have an

1019
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:25,259
order and you don't have support at the

1020
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,269
highest level what happens probably

1021
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:30,089
because you're working in a vacuum or

1022
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:31,950
silo that's about it the other really

1023
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:33,990
nice thing about risk management right

1024
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,490
is the business will tell you what it

1025
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:38,308
wants and will support you in that

1026
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,990
process it's not me over here with a

1027
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:44,279
megaphone saying you have to do this

1028
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:47,098
they don't so beauty little cheat sheet

1029
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:49,859
here but they don't have a copy of this

1030
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:52,740
presentation there's more things you

1031
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:56,098
should ask when evaluating controls

1032
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:58,500
number first of all if control the

1033
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:05,549
reduced risk more than he did which

1034
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:07,920
happens a lot Hey yes two blacks do that

1035
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:09,180
correct create a lot of level see

1036
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,589
leather less expensive alternative

1037
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:15,240
exists this is about cost if you total

1038
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:18,240
cost more than the risk reduction

1039
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,788
provided so you recommend something that

1040
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,569
is greater than the total revenue for

1041
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:25,769
the business in a year by something else

1042
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:27,450
if your soul does not reduce risk

1043
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:29,339
efficiently then look for more controls

1044
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:31,348
we're difficult so there may be a suite

1045
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:33,119
of things to solve that problem or maybe

1046
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:35,819
there's another option so talk to people

1047
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,500
you know get some opinions if you can't

1048
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:41,279
all provides enough risk reduction and

1049
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,319
it's also a fact is that you see if all

1050
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:46,190
else fails ask local captain you're

1051
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,190
seated right

1052
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:58,680
so wrapping up here some insights for me

1053
00:46:54,359 --> 00:47:00,869
and the people I work with this may not

1054
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,969
be a hundred percent after it's pretty

1055
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:04,819
close the top ten risks that we often

1056
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:08,190
find when doing a risk assessment

1057
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:10,529
everyone you do not have any governance

1058
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,029
the board doesn't give a crap about your

1059
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:14,309
top ten cybersecurity risk they don't

1060
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:18,989
even know what that means and you have

1061
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:20,910
to help them do that I don't know how to

1062
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:23,069
interpret risk at the highest level of

1063
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:25,788
business make decisions do you think I

1064
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:29,279
have risk or too much stress absolutely

1065
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:32,180
we need people that own risk in each of

1066
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:36,630
their areas and if I'm a date owner

1067
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,410
Human Resources finance rnd follow so on

1068
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,059
and so forth

1069
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:41,160
I own the wrist whether I know it or not

1070
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,660
I just may not be making smart decisions

1071
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,519
about it because we didn't use this

1072
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,799
order process and no one told you I

1073
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:47,519
don't even know what data because quite

1074
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:51,029
honestly I think

1075
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:54,649
ITL called it to policy procedures and

1076
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:57,029
controls you know Birgit world a

1077
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,549
thorough information security policy is

1078
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:02,069
no more than ten pages why because all

1079
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:04,709
it is is the direction that the business

1080
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:07,079
wishes to take and a new way to know if

1081
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:09,538
your policy is any good or not is how

1082
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,690
the board read it if they can't get

1083
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:14,130
through and understand it it's no good

1084
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,559
all the other things behind that link

1085
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:19,070
your control standards which are derived

1086
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,570
from the Russian yeah

1087
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:23,900
and a subsection of those that are owned

1088
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,490
by HR finance technology so on so forth

1089
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,490
and then the procedures that support

1090
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:29,720
those standards made even more that

1091
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,669
those businesses don't do that properly

1092
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,919
therefore they can't believe set

1093
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:36,740
direction and they can't really measure

1094
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:41,110
whether out in their desire to have good

1095
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:43,910
controls the in classification so if I

1096
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,940
indefinable my assets my data assets are

1097
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:48,230
those businesses don't have any idea how

1098
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,000
many workers they have in each

1099
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,950
department and what their value to the

1100
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,350
businesses from CIA perspective

1101
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:57,140
confidentiality availability if you

1102
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:58,400
don't have that don't expect to be able

1103
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:03,129
to do any sort of effective risk

1104
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:08,060
management or managed security at all

1105
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:10,100
absolutely control terrible right not

1106
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,799
generally owned by the people that

1107
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,080
should oh I'm not saying that you know

1108
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,600
the director of HR should be going in

1109
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,430
and making a group policy changes group

1110
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,900
associations all these things but I am

1111
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,480
saying that they should approve all

1112
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,580
access and especially exceptions to

1113
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,580
their standards why because they own the

1114
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,799
risk they only data and any access given

1115
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:34,970
that isn't in line with risk appetite

1116
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,470
isn't up to me it's also a media reason

1117
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,799
why organizations you've hacked all time

1118
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:43,310
too much access either advertently or

1119
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:48,020
inadvertently response we do you don't

1120
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:50,660
have a plan you don't test the plan then

1121
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:52,220
there is magic you share data Thunder

1122
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,759
you have no idea what they do for

1123
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,959
security pretty bad you couldn't stuff

1124
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,780
in the cloud you're letting people

1125
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,210
connect to you whatever it is whatever

1126
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,430
you define is your direction your

1127
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,140
policies and your standards if your data

1128
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,419
goes somewhere else all those same

1129
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:12,859
things apply how do you ensure that

1130
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:14,210
those third parties are doing some

1131
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,310
research reports that up to two fairs

1132
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,000
with riches and some couple years ago

1133
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,100
where because

1134
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:26,590
why because I feel really good about

1135
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:30,460
this great Czech awareness and training

1136
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:32,830
right workforce not just end users

1137
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,040
supposed to be careful here everybody in

1138
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,759
the organization has a security role I

1139
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,650
don't know why I'm picking on the

1140
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,930
director of HR today but I have the

1141
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:43,570
director of HR as a security goal do

1142
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,109
they know that they are responsible for

1143
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:48,070
approving all access to their assets and

1144
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:51,940
do they know how to do that

1145
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:53,410
have they been trained on does the

1146
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,890
development team know how to integrate

1147
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:59,560
security into the SDS they've been

1148
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,629
trained on does do the physical security

1149
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,110
guards know how to report physical

1150
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:06,760
security incidents do the end-users and

1151
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:11,290
employees know how to report physical

1152
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,180
security attacks as on secure

1153
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:15,430
configuration baselines so this is the

1154
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:18,850
first time you seen right is it actually

1155
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:21,190
technology focus not having a standard

1156
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:23,290
for how my firewalls and wireless and

1157
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:26,710
servers and policies should be

1158
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:28,690
configured means that what I do best

1159
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,700
effort when we set it up it was good

1160
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,810
three years later this is still good I

1161
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,600
don't know I don't have a baseline

1162
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:37,600
compare against Dan's pretty good at

1163
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,790
this stuff so I feel good do people go

1164
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,910
in these systems and change things every

1165
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,130
day yes and how do you know that it's

1166
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:48,940
still in line with what you decided was

1167
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:51,270
a reasonable set of controls so I can

1168
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:56,400
think back to a really simple example a

1169
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:58,120
college has a reportable incident that

1170
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,730
I'll need it fast

1171
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,859
Voyles way back to somebody unchecking

1172
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,770
one box skin there's a damn puppy

1173
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:08,100
so someone turned off the rules that

1174
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:10,750
blogged about it five times

1175
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,770
read is to that everyone decided yeah

1176
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,280
here's where this is the funds were

1177
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:16,560
going to block in general go wasn't you

1178
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,970
know baseline it was never shipped

1179
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,970
somewhere somehow someone there

1180
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:26,078
vanya monitoring or security of

1181
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:27,549
Management huge problem it's almost the

1182
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,739
same issue if I don't define what

1183
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:31,269
interview and who's responsible for

1184
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:33,429
there were pieces of that how to

1185
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:35,618
actually know doing it and then more

1186
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:37,959
ability management right everyone has

1187
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:41,289
more ability management and patching

1188
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:43,058
solution but if we go in and assess its

1189
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:44,979
efficacy we see that there are things

1190
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,569
missed because I have to configure it

1191
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:48,279
the right way it has to be able to

1192
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:50,709
integrate all of my systems not the

1193
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:54,599
right permissions how's work usually

1194
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:58,899
it's not or partially so to make it

1195
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:03,539
really simple those issues can be put in

1196
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:06,729
three categories business process people

1197
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:08,559
or technology and this is a summary

1198
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:11,558
elevating all the risk assessments that

1199
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,729
great hassle did last year the majority

1200
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,479
the problems from the business around

1201
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:17,799
cybersecurity period the next biggest

1202
00:53:16,479 --> 00:53:19,509
beautiful isn't the people know who knew

1203
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:22,179
their security no wonder they did what's

1204
00:53:19,509 --> 00:53:24,429
been a data owner and I started in uber

1205
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:25,509
and then technology district

1206
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:27,189
why because we were thinking about

1207
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:30,939
summers the greatest technology problem

1208
00:53:27,189 --> 00:53:32,949
for a long very long time and going

1209
00:53:30,939 --> 00:53:34,538
obviously we've got the technology we

1210
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:39,489
need but we don't have the processes we

1211
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:42,399
need to support critical success factors

1212
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:44,499
yes don't buy umbrella hope that rates

1213
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:48,009
but don't buy umbrellas effective to

1214
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:51,158
work in earth right we're talking about

1215
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:54,069
let's understand our risks and by the

1216
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:55,749
way don't fold at all know how to define

1217
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:57,029
how this does make those decisions for

1218
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:58,928
you

1219
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:01,839
really important we will come back to

1220
00:53:58,929 --> 00:54:03,909
this own it all this stuff so I just

1221
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,099
spelled out are not clearly owned by

1222
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,809
some money this will fail they'll be

1223
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:09,819
like all the other stuff we try to do

1224
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:12,130
that we end up with some list of stuff

1225
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:13,369
as in some spreadsheet oh my god and we

1226
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:17,359
did

1227
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:18,380
do you need owner first management then

1228
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,660
you need to have an order for the

1229
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,329
remediation needs to be visible and it

1230
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:26,118
should absolutely go to the board or put

1231
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:28,460
on level for approval and tracking that

1232
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,739
means it's important business sounds

1233
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,420
simple but a lot of organizations still

1234
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:33,469
don't get it

1235
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,660
you're either building the defensible

1236
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:38,779
position area for your business or for

1237
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:41,479
yourself so ask yourself are you

1238
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:44,119
compliant or secure and how complying

1239
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:48,229
their security wanna be we process stand

1240
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:50,599
up to scrutiny you had a problem others

1241
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:52,669
are there did you do the right stuff

1242
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:53,809
because quite honestly if you did the

1243
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:55,039
right things you're still gonna have

1244
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:57,349
problems hopefully they'll be blessed

1245
00:54:55,039 --> 00:55:00,559
this doesn't occur so are you going to

1246
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:02,210
be the three out of four from the hippo

1247
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,690
review that didn't do it right or you

1248
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:07,789
couldn't want to do and of course if you

1249
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:09,769
need help yeah that's really important

1250
00:55:07,789 --> 00:55:12,349
message because this process sometimes

1251
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:13,430
is really difficult implement why we're

1252
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:15,499
literally bringing the whole business

1253
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:18,200
together we do this so we need people

1254
00:55:15,499 --> 00:55:20,538
invested from all of the business units

1255
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:25,218
to make that successful that is it it

1256
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:29,920
was any questions happy yes or no so you

1257
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:29,920
are sort of or vetting feta cheese yes I

1258
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:45,390
describe this kind of make my children

1259
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:49,769
stop my video

1260
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:54,180
right they just continuously encountered

1261
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:56,910
that any successes that you had sir let

1262
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:59,519
me rephrase the question find it very

1263
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:02,399
difficult to get ownership around this

1264
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:05,999
process of the remediation and what tips

1265
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:09,329
do I have in helping to get the business

1266
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:16,200
to not only recognize let's support

1267
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:18,059
those others yeah okay

1268
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,819
these two individual people resisted

1269
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:22,470
another problem with security rules but

1270
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:25,319
an on state and job descriptions an

1271
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:26,970
expectation so if you will hire me to be

1272
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:29,190
the director wages are nowhere in there

1273
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,419
did it say you will own the HR data

1274
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,509
participate in the risk management

1275
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:37,910
process and ensure that all the HR

1276
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:41,190
related gaps and remediation items are

1277
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:45,690
effectively managed or not that's where

1278
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:49,440
it starts so and you'll find that gap

1279
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:51,749
almost everywhere if the risk assessment

1280
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,420
includes the right stakeholders that is

1281
00:56:51,749 --> 00:56:55,859
the most effective way to get past that

1282
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,470
hurdle which is know under the new

1283
00:56:55,859 --> 00:57:01,220
litter all of us so there's really three

1284
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:04,368
objectives in a risk assessment for me

1285
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:06,660
one is what you guys already expected

1286
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:09,930
identifying gaps against it with

1287
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:12,149
standards or controls right to another

1288
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:14,009
woman you expect prioritize those based

1289
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:16,499
on risk but there's a third one which is

1290
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:18,420
Korean awareness about the process and

1291
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:22,680
the priorities and the ownership of

1292
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:24,420
these gaps so if the process is done in

1293
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,480
a way that includes the right people

1294
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,700
both in the assessment part and then in

1295
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,400
the risk workshop piece you will you

1296
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,379
will help solve many of those problems

1297
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,390
ultimately you need people to be pretty

1298
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,880
global and supportive of the process of

1299
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,490
a good

1300
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,890
to the most senior resources in that

1301
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:44,799
company over to the board or the CEO or

1302
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:46,950
remember that might be or else that lack

1303
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,480
of understanding of responsibilities

1304
00:57:46,950 --> 00:58:06,850
leads to what you discuss business

1305
00:57:49,480 --> 00:58:19,030
it actually yes we immediately saw

1306
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:21,730
things like talk to their C cell he was

1307
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:23,440
a smart guy yeah just have observe all

1308
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:27,730
that assessment done by another group

1309
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,470
and he said well the conclusion are what

1310
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:33,580
they told me when I took away from this

1311
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:37,660
