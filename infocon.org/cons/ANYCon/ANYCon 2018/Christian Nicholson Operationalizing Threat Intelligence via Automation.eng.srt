1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,810
all right so welcome everyone we're

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,060
gonna be talking about operationalizing

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,460
in frightened Journal program for you as

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,139
well as what against you and how you can

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,090
do it we'll start by talking briefly

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,620
about what a threat intelligence program

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,929
is what it entails what are some of the

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,698
basic features of having a program where

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,140
do the basic outcomes and then we'll get

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,939
into the nitty-gritty of how you can

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,160
actually automate some of the more

12
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,080
complex parts of it so that you have

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,150
have the ability to then keep your cheer

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,038
ones up to a tier 3 level and

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,699
functionality but not necessarily in

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,200
knowledge base or practice so quick

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,230
blurb about me

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,870
I'm Christian nice to meet everyone I

19
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,890
also go by Barney cosmos or cosmos by

20
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,949
most of my friends because they're all

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,329
too lazy to say my full handle I was

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,489
previously the pen testing and threat

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,890
intelligence lead for 80 mg my book

24
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,870
developed and ran the service line I

25
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,000
moved on to me the talisman threat

26
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,129
researcher specializing top-billed out

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,469
in French all some programs Mehldau as

28
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,358
well some of the iron anthing services I

29
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,609
actually spent my last year redesigning

30
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,689
completely one of this socks for the

31
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,510
portion by my Viking is not often one of

32
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,740
the enemies for stands I do a lot of the

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,290
for the last five years I've done a lot

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,169
of the course audit question authoring

35
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,390
and I also have an instructor for 560

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,470
and 504 so that's your G pen and your G

37
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,780
CI h horses so I like to jump right into

38
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,189
these things first let's talk about

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,619
thread himself brand new tell is really

40
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,750
the sugar and spice on top of all your

41
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,460
security programs it gives you that

42
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,140
context and I'm going to come back to

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,850
that word a lot because it's one of the

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,790
most important words when you're talking

45
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,979
about their intelligence so considering

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,920
that why do we need threat intelligence

47
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,539
for intelligence gives us the context to

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,369
know how to deal with the attacks that

49
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,810
we're facing it also can potentially

50
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,549
give us the advantage over our

51
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,689
adversaries by allowing us to make

52
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,149
preemptive moves

53
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,689
knowing that we might be attacked in a

54
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,670
certain fashion in doing so it gives us

55
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,500
a lot of different advantages so friend

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,000
tensions from a non cyber student

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,860
perspective is typically viewed as

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,960
having intelligence on your adversaries

59
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,840
as well as being able

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,269
the same context perpetrates down in

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,530
suicide perspective now in a cycle

62
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,000
perspective it can allow us to

63
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,190
preemptively select things you might

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,080
want to patch in advance to help protect

65
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,760
against you know threads in the wild

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,940
weren't threats that we my finger on the

67
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,070
rocks for example when MSO 867 came out

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,900
back in the day those companies that had

69
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,670
already in early adopters of the threat

70
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,100
intelligence program had already been

71
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,299
the first on that hatch list so they

72
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,829
were already communicating with

73
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,410
Microsoft in order to make sure that

74
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,210
those DLL and that nati ulnar ability

75
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,440
was being passed prior to the public

76
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,300
disclosure on it so that's a little bit

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,070
about what it is how we can use it and

78
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,459
how you can really get started with a

79
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,620
program so let's say you know you got

80
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,090
your C so he had the buzz word tomorrow

81
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,709
we want to start a thread intelligence

82
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,170
program what does that look like what

83
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,610
does that tell and what you need so

84
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,140
historic trend conscious program the

85
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,930
barrier to entry is actually pretty low

86
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,700
you really just need an analyst who have

87
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,470
the ability and the knowledge and the

88
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,450
skill set to start doing intelligence

89
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,950
there are lots of open source tools and

90
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,738
utilities there's things like buyers

91
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,350
total you have new tech spread exchange

92
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,440
if you're looking for IO C's or to start

93
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,540
at baseline but even less than that the

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,640
basics of their intelligence really come

95
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,310
down to add in context of already known

96
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,170
pieces of data so for example your

97
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,360
organization's subscribe to a news feed

98
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,149
generally could be Yahoo unity could be

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,850
just seeing that it can be CNN whatever

100
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,709
use that you want to subscribe to having

101
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,750
that finalist actually on a daily basis

102
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,390
go ahead collect and curate that news

103
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,220
before the c-suite level executives have

104
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,540
a chance to view in the museum freak out

105
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,400
about it and then come down to the

106
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,230
analyst to ask the questions being able

107
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,420
to actually write a little blurb that

108
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,940
says hey this is the non-technical

109
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,010
breakdown this is why we should or

110
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,799
should not be concerned and this is what

111
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,629
as an organization that and its core

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,310
that context part is threat intelligence

113
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:08,760
so as I mentioned one of the use cases

114
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,360
of this is to prevent fun so but it is

115
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,090
up here I doubt and our misunderstanding

116
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,199
of our actual threat landscape so one of

117
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,180
the things that French culture can

118
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,370
provide you instead of having your

119
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,418
executive go out ahead of time and see

120
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,479
the article in news

121
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,190
perfect example aquabox appache began

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,229
instructional mobility came a really big

123
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,340
thing those of us in the intelligence

124
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,539
community have already been talking

125
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,880
about stress through months and months

126
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,650
and months in advance of a breach and we

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,690
were already informing our clients hey

128
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,020
you really should touch this we haven't

129
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,690
seen it in the wild yet but it's an easy

130
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,039
outward facing vulnerability so if you

131
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,840
guys worried one of the earlier classes

132
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,940
they were doing here about

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,349
reconnaissance one of the things he said

134
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,270
it seems to go to show ends going to

135
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,070
look for you know whatever is out there

136
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,780
already there's for a keynote this

137
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,250
morning and we touched on auto schooling

138
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,530
which was that collaboration between

139
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,030
show an and Metasploit these are both

140
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,710
really good methods that a lot of the

141
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,599
tackles and adversaries for high-level

142
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,138
and low-level are going to use in the

143
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:08,550
first phases of attack having a fair

144
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,110
intelligence program really helps to

145
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,460
prepare you to prevent something like

146
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,780
that so desirable outcome sort of some

147
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,948
of the desirable things that we can get

148
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,750
immediately out of our threatened

149
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,849
sovereign we have our analysts our

150
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,380
analysts knows our environment they know

151
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,389
how to contextualise data for an

152
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,099
environment and they have a basic

153
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,990
understanding of multiple technical

154
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:30,150
disciplines so they have a basic I our

155
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,320
understanding a business understanding

156
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,969
and they also have a forensic

157
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,360
understanding so they can speak to each

158
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,979
of the contexts now we can start

159
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,080
deciding well do you want to have a deal

160
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,969
18 feet do you want to have a weekly or

161
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
monthly need you just want to normally

162
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,449
start with it's a monthly fee I like to

163
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,490
estimate on average therefore a monthly

164
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,370
fee you need about eight analyst hours

165
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,190
per month to generate that one

166
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,840
newsletter and we'll talk about what

167
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,020
that newsletter will consist of in just

168
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,489
a little bit now if you were going to go

169
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,990
to something like a weekly newsletter

170
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,180
you would probably wanted to

171
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,520
get out who me as opposed to eight hours

172
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,970
a month for that newsletter then give

173
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,979
the analysts plenty of times you curate

174
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,220
contextualized understand digest and

175
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,750
then give you a business readable output

176
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,870
now you might also want to consider

177
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,610
having different levels of output from

178
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,620
your Intel program and what I mean by

179
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,900
that is it's really good for a part of

180
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,970
your security awareness program as your

181
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,280
why do you turn a user base to have an

182
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,990
opt-in program or often newsletter where

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,630
anyone in your organization can opt-in

184
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,610
for a security context newsletter now

185
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,050
there are use cases where you might not

186
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,669
want all of the data that you're putting

187
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,789
in this newsletter to be publicly

188
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,440
available so similar to how the FBI and

189
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,509
other three-letter organizations use

190
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,190
certain emails to distribute between

191
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,560
tech leaders of companies that are

192
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,639
relevant to them your threat

193
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,930
intelligence program because that's

194
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,849
really just a larger threat Intel

195
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,080
program and sharing program when you see

196
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,650
like that beside exact and all the I

197
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,900
socks

198
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,409
those are really just large group

199
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,698
funding crowd source Intel programs so

200
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:04,469
when you're internalizing it for review

201
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,710
I make use of those and you want to be

202
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,970
able to emulate those functionalities so

203
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,919
when you have your daily weekly or

204
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,710
monthly needs you might consider having

205
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,630
two one core public consumption within

206
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,039
your company and one that's specifically

207
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,530
for the security personnel that's

208
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,180
restricted that way any sensitive data

209
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,020
that you put into restricted email

210
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,159
doesn't become public domain so we

211
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,570
talked a little bit about some of the

212
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,909
skills in again I'm just gonna highlight

213
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,800
then one more time here right you need

214
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:34,770
someone who can be a critical thing or

215
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,990
someone who understands you then have

216
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,130
the ability textual eyes that deal again

217
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,020
I'm going to come back to that word a

218
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,120
lot you know I'm not a fan of buzzwords

219
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,120
but in this case context really matters

220
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,359
organizational awareness having with

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
someone who is really really good at

222
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,199
hand testing I are in forensics and has

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,270
a good understanding all those practices

224
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,550
but doesn't have an understanding of

225
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,430
your organization what your network

226
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,590
looks like it's not really beneficial to

227
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,150
you a lot of cases when we take threat

228
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,039
Intel because it's grown all around the

229
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,138
context there might be mitigating

230
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,050
control so a threat that is normally

231
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,509
rated at an on a CDSs score might

232
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,369
actually be fi for your

233
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,159
because hey it's protecting something of

234
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,629
nominal value or be it might be higher

235
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,009
than a 10 for you because it's

236
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,860
protecting something of great

237
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,319
significance to you conversely if

238
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,299
they're also naivety get in control so

239
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,569
perfect example of this certain

240
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:32,309
applications that are web pacing if you

241
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,990
have a lap in front of that and the web

242
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,878
has a particular signature that you know

243
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,009
will block and attack that's

244
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,079
communicated control so regardless of

245
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,149
whether or not that server is now

246
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:43,739
patched in this example we use the

247
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,120
pollachi stress if I have all the

248
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,490
signatures that I could think of our

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,290
bocce struts I can say thoroughly then

250
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,180
get in control now I'm not advocating

251
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,069
for not catching and using mitigating

252
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,589
controls mitigating control should only

253
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,509
ever be used as a temporary fix but it

254
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:59,040
is the way to give you a larger period

255
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,939
of time to do your testing and make sure

256
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,750
you don't break your production

257
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:06,599
applications the ability to identify key

258
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,639
assets so that comes back to my previous

259
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,959
point right we need to know where are

260
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,839
our keys to the kingdom

261
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,949
what is important to us as a business

262
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,459
one of the things that I like to talk

263
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:19,889
about a lot is insecurity you need to

264
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,750
win your goal is a security provider on

265
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,819
the defensive side and you need on the

266
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,069
offensive side just to win and it's

267
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:27,750
impossible as a defender to say I am

268
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:31,459
going to successfully block every time

269
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,170
so how do I win as a security provider I

270
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:38,069
redefine what I consider winning to be

271
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,290
so if I am a credit card company and my

272
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:42,779
piece of the kingdom are the PII and the

273
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,420
credit card data and that's sitting in a

274
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,639
base that's encrypted at rest and also

275
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,229
encrypted during transit I don't really

276
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,639
care you can botnet my entire

277
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,750
organization to have complete control

278
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,850
over every endpoint

279
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,309
if you can't decrypt back Anna I still

280
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,930
want you have control over everything in

281
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:01,230
my organization but the thing that's

282
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,029
important to me is still mine so

283
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,879
identifying the key asset and what

284
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,399
really matters and having that context

285
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,889
there's the word again is really what

286
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,420
makes this possible

287
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,639
scripting the aggregation while not

288
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,229
mandatory is really really useful for a

289
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,850
threat intelligence analyst and this

290
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,069
allows them to do a lot of automation

291
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,580
and minimize those number of hours that

292
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:24,269
are actually

293
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,950
or to generate these news feeds now you

294
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:27,300
can't replace that analyst entirely the

295
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,769
automation because what you're really

296
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,029
looking for is that critical thinking

297
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,130
that ability to contextualise

298
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,950
and that's not something that we have

299
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,660
the ability to replace but we could save

300
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,310
a couple hours and go to different news

301
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,050
sites and having an automated digest

302
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,339
that we can now as the analyst go

303
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,779
through and then start writing our

304
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,779
blurbs after we digest the information

305
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,579
context matters I will scream that from

306
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,199
the rooftop anyone who has a threatened

307
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,269
total compensation and does not talk

308
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,040
about context does not know what they're

309
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,649
talking about because that's already

310
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,779
tell his threat Intel is context if you

311
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,670
ever get into a vendor conversation with

312
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,490
a threat intelligence provider and they

313
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,990
don't say the word context kick them out

314
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,740
and go kick again because you're not

315
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,740
picking the right ones

316
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,540
so boiling down into that newsletter

317
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,930
what is the process of developing the

318
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,060
newsletter look like first you have your

319
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,620
analyst collect their news articles so

320
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,729
you're know the Alice's then go out and

321
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,100
they can do this either manually

322
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,529
automated they can use something like

323
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,149
feedly they can do it via scripts and

324
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,120
have a list of sources that you've

325
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,050
predefined as things that you like

326
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,640
they're going to go visit these sites

327
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,010
they're going to pick articles that seem

328
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,880
interesting and potentially relevant to

329
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,770
them as the client then they're going to

330
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,660
read and digest now the reason we

331
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,699
allocate so much time in threat

332
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,860
intelligence for generating something

333
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,440
that might appear to be just a simple

334
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,870
newsletter that feel like someone could

335
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,910
have written in an hour or so it's

336
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,709
because we really want that analyst to

337
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,219
be able to digest and understand what

338
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,310
they're reading

339
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,290
when specter and meltdown female

340
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,510
Google have put out some really really

341
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,649
good write-up write-ups on the

342
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,410
vulnerabilities and what they actually

343
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,480
entail and there was a lot of reaction

344
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,949
in the beginning similar to what

345
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,660
happened with brohamer so those of you

346
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,109
who aren't familiar with brohamer row

347
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,510
hammer was a very theoretical experiment

348
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,550
in which using magnets and other

349
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,680
electromagnetic fields we can actually

350
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,529
cause a bit jump in

351
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,899
we'll feel in a chip and cause data to

352
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,550
be written now the really cool thing

353
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,230
about that which you can do it and

354
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,959
there's actually now a remote version of

355
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,790
that that works but when I say it works

356
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,680
I'm gonna put the air quotes up for that

357
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,579
one it works in a lot of environment

358
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,739
because they have that perfect

359
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,719
conditions to be successful and even

360
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,809
then on last estimate it was only

361
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,949
successful about 52 to 67 percent of the

362
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:56,910
time and I try to be specific acts are

363
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:59,128
important now the reason for this was do

364
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,300
Denisha attack without having actually

365
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,309
understood that full meltdown

366
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,868
just like with meltdown expected without

367
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,868
understanding what speculative execution

368
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:08,670
actually was you could not context let's

369
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,339
back to your environment and prioritize

370
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,189
your passion the difficulty of execution

371
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,480
of an attack is one of the most vital

372
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:17,069
pieces of information threat

373
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,959
intelligence can gather breathe because

374
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:22,589
that tells you what your priority really

375
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,300
is so we're going to our

376
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,800
contextualization case right we're

377
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,479
digesting our articles we want our

378
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,849
panelist to go out read the article

379
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,009
understand the article find the sources

380
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,139
met the sources or the reference in the

381
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,220
article and do their own research we

382
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,670
want to make sure that they're not just

383
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,110
creating an article out of one source we

384
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,339
want to make sure we exhaust all of our

385
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,660
sources on the topic finally we want to

386
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,610
decide it we're going to divide between

387
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,259
the two or more newsletters are we

388
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,029
saying that the data via contextual ad

389
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,740
to a certain extent should only be

390
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,110
available to certain members of our

391
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,179
security team for example in are we

392
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,740
placing ourselves at risk by allowing

393
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,110
any one of the organizations you know

394
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,249
hey there's this really really bad

395
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,079
gulnur ability that we're really

396
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:06,589
vulnerable to and someone could exploit

397
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,758
tomorrow and we'd be dead as a company

398
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,220
that's probably not something that I

399
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,379
want anyone of my company to know

400
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,389
because they might be afraid they might

401
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,670
start looking for their jobs they might

402
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:19,949
be motivated to disclose this for

403
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,279
monetary or personal gain and that

404
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:25,679
creates another risk for me so managing

405
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,629
risk is also the part of the threat

406
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,069
intelligence providers we want to make

407
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:31,319
sure that we're contextualizing the data

408
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,699
to the right people at the right time

409
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:34,349
and making sure that

410
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,320
people were receiving our data other

411
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,730
people were privileged to that data and

412
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,980
finally you have the output of our

413
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,960
process which is one or more newsletters

414
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,340
in the most basic form it's simply going

415
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,350
to be an opt-in newsletter that we

416
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,300
publish on our internal website thing

417
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,280
hey guys if you guys are interested in

418
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,900
security or your mother's news money

419
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,640
people and you're going out you're

420
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,829
reading the news every day and then

421
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,390
freaking out because oh my god there's

422
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,350
this email credit harvesting thing I

423
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,960
heard about what happens if I get a fish

424
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,340
well I know know that okay my

425
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,590
organization is doing something about it

426
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,390
this is what our mitigating controls are

427
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,250
this is what's in front of me and this

428
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,220
is what's protecting me as a member of

429
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:16,200
this organization and then your manager

430
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,910
a restricted info letter which normally

431
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,190
would consist of strictly your security

432
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,079
teams and only the heads of those teams

433
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,470
so anyone who would be privileged to you

434
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,420
an FBI letter a yellow paper any of

435
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,620
those things those are two of the people

436
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,329
you would want to be on your restricted

437
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:35,070
list now I always complete show up signs

438
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,290
every christen tation I do always have a

439
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,450
stone one because I never want anyone to

440
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,430
leave in presentation I do and and be

441
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,760
like that's great that was cool what did

442
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,620
I do

443
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,819
how do I use that so we're going to come

444
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,720
back to this in a second or one of the

445
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,390
things we're going to come back to you

446
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,010
is what does it actually cost me have in

447
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,980
for an intelligence program and what's

448
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,510
my return on investment look like

449
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,160
because one of the hardest is to justify

450
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,710
insecurity is your return on investment

451
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,449
and you can't justify a budget to your C

452
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,180
so when you're asking for money for all

453
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:06,210
these cool tools if they don't know what

454
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,560
they're getting out of it so we talk

455
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,120
about threat intelligence we've talked a

456
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,119
little bit about what it was you talked

457
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,530
about how to start a program now I'm

458
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,450
going to teach you one of the more

459
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,550
advanced stages how do we automate this

460
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,950
how do we operationalize it and make it

461
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,260
a part of our daily workflows what did

462
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,590
we do to make this usable to our

463
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,600
analysts well I'm glad you asked and we

464
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,310
have a couple of requirements that we're

465
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,380
going to talk about here to make this

466
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,530
usable for analysts in a very effective

467
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,420
and automated matter now we a platform

468
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,829
for the sake of examples

469
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,240
any demonstration here today we'll be

470
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,040
using multi go for those of you who

471
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,440
aren't familiar multi go was developed

472
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,750
by Aventura it is a threat intelligence

473
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,320
platform that's predominately used for

474
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,690
gathering data via api's we're also

475
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,220
going to need some source data now I'm

476
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,360
going to show you two examples I'm going

477
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,149
to talk a lot about the difference

478
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,620
between the two one of them is going to

479
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,870
be strictly from an external perspective

480
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,089
and what can be done with that data and

481
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,309
the second is going to be a more

482
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,839
in-depth model that leverages lots of

483
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,149
data that you have internally already

484
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,619
that you're already collecting so for

485
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,270
our source data we're going to be using

486
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,719
buyers total as our external threat

487
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,189
intelligence platform resource our chip

488
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,910
we're also be using local network data

489
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,929
and data box now the last thing and the

490
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,949
most important part of guard

491
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,799
intelligence program when we talk about

492
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,480
it a little already is people so when a

493
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,070
lot of dating and operationalizing if

494
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,450
your intelligence program there's two

495
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,760
roles that are really important and

496
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,110
smaller organizations this role may be

497
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,790
shared and this is why I talked about

498
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,918
earlier one of the skills that might be

499
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,260
really did have scripting for the

500
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,030
automation purposes so you're going to

501
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,679
need someone who's good at customization

502
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,440
of orchestration someone who's really

503
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,419
good at x-rated websites reading and

504
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,070
writing from 80 guys and making tools

505
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,080
work together and play nice with one

506
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,950
another integrations personally you know

507
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,470
I program

508
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,630
half a dozen different languages you

509
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,549
know I can list those all day and for me

510
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,929
the one that works best right now is

511
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:04,100
Python that's my personal current

512
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:06,360
favorite that's always subject to change

513
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,709
the second part you use that threat

514
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,928
intelligence analyst the person who's

515
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:15,000
gotten and actually had all the context

516
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:16,559
that makes this data usable so because

517
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,360
we're going to be talking about multi no

518
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,040
in this scenario I'll offer you up

519
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,120
towards the end a couple different

520
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,530
alternatives there's plenty of open

521
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,709
source things you can use things like

522
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,629
crits if you're using the high or miss

523
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,860
these are all things that you can do if

524
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,299
you're using something more commercial

525
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,370
if you're using an outlay siient product

526
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:35,220
like JIRA to match your tickets or if

527
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,790
you're using something like snow service

528
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,770
now send us any of those it is possible

529
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,879
to add integration to top of this that

530
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,220
help you to do these different things

531
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,500
that we're going to talk about here same

532
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,310
thing if you're using directly out of

533
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,170
your Sam you

534
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,090
using your sims building case management

535
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,130
utilities or you're using some

536
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,270
integrations a lot of the things we're

537
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,940
about to talk about are still possible

538
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,310
within there and I'll talk about as we

539
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,220
go through why I like multi go and Brack

540
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,929
based platforms for this particular

541
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,670
grocery so what I have up here is an

542
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,170
environment set up this is actually a

543
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,310
diagram again from service website

544
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,780
because we're going to be using multi go

545
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,010
in this example and I'll talk about I

546
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,050
know there's a lot of stuff on here

547
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,530
we'll talk about what the mandatory make

548
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:18,480
this process work and was optional so of

549
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,670
the things on the end here we have to

550
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,930
start with a client these are optional

551
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,610
the differences between them again

552
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,800
they're multi to a specific this will

553
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,110
vary as your mileage will with different

554
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,360
products in this case we have classic

555
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,709
Excel and ze the difference between them

556
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,899
is the number of objects you can have on

557
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,630
a single screen of time Community

558
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,310
Edition is free you have 12 objects on

559
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,650
your screen at a time and return twelve

560
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,990
objects of time then you move up to you

561
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,570
plastic which is ten thousand in Excel

562
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,680
which is unlimited

563
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,790
so that's your platform that's where

564
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,770
we're going to view them and emulation

565
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,659
our data the next thing we're going to

566
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,370
need is a server of some sort that

567
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,640
server is going to be our gateway to our

568
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,169
data so multigo has two different

569
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,360
options they have commercial transform

570
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,400
servers in the context of multi go to

571
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,469
transform is is the pre-built script

572
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,360
that doesn't work for you it goes out

573
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,450
and gathers the data process it parses

574
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,909
it and prints an engineer view the

575
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,490
commercial transform data server is

576
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,410
going to be hosted by multi go in their

577
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,140
cloud you can opt for an on-site edition

578
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,730
of it for various privacy reasons so

579
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,980
that you're not exposing yourself by

580
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,620
potentially giving your attacker an idea

581
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,360
of what you're looking up about them and

582
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,250
really that's just there's a lot of nice

583
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,899
things about chicos already built for

584
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,980
you integrations with a lot of

585
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,080
commercial products and a lot of

586
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,830
commercial tips things like CrowdStrike

587
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,510
recording future be my key my mouth all

588
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,710
the things are really already built into

589
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,530
the commercial transfer this gives you a

590
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,240
lot of time and development money the

591
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,060
other thing that they use is an internal

592
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,810
transfer observer so internal transform

593
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,610
server here

594
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,428
June is pretty

595
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,990
demonstrate is pretty mandatory what

596
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,150
that does for you is it allows you to

597
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,100
actually access the data parse it

598
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,530
locally and it also allows you to

599
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,330
distribute it amongst multiple clients

600
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,010
as opposed to just doing everything will

601
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,689
be under client if you were to do

602
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,370
everything locally on your client you

603
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,809
can still make this work it's just a

604
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,889
little more heavy on the management and

605
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,450
I'll talk towards the end of the

606
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,040
presentation about some of the cost

607
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,170
associated with this particular approach

608
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,639
and then we can also talk about what

609
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,429
costs might look like your different

610
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,840
product ranges if any one I'll leave

611
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:22,610
that open to the Q&A section and we can

612
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,260
talk about what products you guys have

613
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,870
your organization's or your familiar but

614
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,669
and I can pull from you know my

615
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,889
experience what those cost models look

616
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,870
like for each different product the next

617
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,000
thing is the most important here that's

618
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,559
a transform server your transform server

619
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,570
can actually be the same server as your

620
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,668
distribution server or your commercial

621
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,320
transform server all that means the

622
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,450
transform server is representative of

623
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,970
where your code piece is going to live

624
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,820
for your transforms again this means

625
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,230
that's just different sets of scripts

626
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,210
that will actually go out and gather the

627
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,559
data and do something think of the

628
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:59,450
transform as the thing that does the

629
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,590
thing great so you have two different

630
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,900
data sources we're going to talk about

631
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,699
here you have public via sources public

632
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,890
data sources might consist of things

633
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,720
like your jeep Public DNS online

634
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,450
databases like buyers total costs of

635
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,049
total hybrid analysis search engines

636
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,880
like Google Bing Yahoo asks social media

637
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,350
Facebook Twitter Twitter's one of the

638
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,710
bigger ones Facebook is about a lot more

639
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,969
restrictive and how you can actually ask

640
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,890
that their data they've limited access

641
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
to the graph API so if your organization

642
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,120
is not one of those two organizations

643
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,910
privileged so that that might not be an

644
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,799
option for you any longer unfortunately

645
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,720
online API so really the sky is the

646
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,668
limit if there is an API or if you can

647
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,790
simulate a man interaction you can

648
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:42,919
interact with that and pull that data

649
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:45,559
and of course that leaves it open to any

650
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,290
other public data source now the

651
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,549
internal data sources this is where you

652
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,320
have to do a lot of your development

653
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:53,330
because there aren't any commercial

654
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,080
transforms that multigo offers openly

655
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,820
and freely to you for your internal

656
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,439
and because everyone's data and their

657
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,450
organizational structure is different

658
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,710
that's your mileage may vary but the

659
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,320
amount of development you might need to

660
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,630
do to get this data so internal API

661
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,970
you're using slug if you're using the SM

662
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,490
if you're using Q radar any of your sims

663
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,520
so they all have open ad eyes you can

664
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,650
dump the data in there and make queries

665
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,820
system blogs if you're using another

666
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,290
utility if you want to pull directly

667
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,030
from syslog if you're a small

668
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,000
organization and you only have a few

669
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,770
servers you can do it that way internal

670
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,020
service like your ad servers your DNS

671
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,290
servers if you're doing DNS management

672
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,879
be it something like IP blocks to make

673
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,280
sure that you're managing your different

674
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,560
DNS allocations you might want to pull

675
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,260
that data in and any other internal data

676
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,060
feeds you might have one of those

677
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,370
internal Indians might actually be your

678
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,620
intelligence music letter you might want

679
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,959
to pull that in then you can link it via

680
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,179
specific specific IO sees that you place

681
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,540
in those newsletters or attacks simply

682
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:58,120
because you kiss all right so I've

683
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,000
talked a lot about a lot of things so

684
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm actually going to show you a demo of

685
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,260
two different scenarios that are based

686
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,790
around this game for scenario and what

687
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,950
the difference between using strictly

688
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,040
public data and strictly internal and

689
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,110
public data look like again this is in

690
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,250
the context of multigo your experiences

691
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,330
will be a little different depending on

692
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,890
what platforms you choose to use so all

693
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,360
i've done here is i've started with an

694
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,740
unknown attacker that's just an empty

695
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,649
graphic it's just a way for me to

696
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,750
visualize what I'm doing I've identified

697
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,880
in my organization that there is this

698
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,890
malicious executable that's doing things

699
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,810
that it shouldn't be called this party I

700
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,370
see for the sake of this example will

701
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,590
consider that it was either flag by a

702
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:43,090
bee or we're able to find it during a

703
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:44,649
hunt I'm now able to take that piece and

704
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,060
I'm going to resolve that to a hash I

705
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,710
think Nick you did it manually I can

706
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,169
look it up based on what I know it might

707
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,970
already be available to me that hat I'm

708
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,980
actually only right click on that icon

709
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,810
and I've got all this data so all that

710
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,720
data was pulled via the virustotal

711
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,539
API via the public data transform which

712
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,539
is freely available for all multi go for

713
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:06,959
user now what's really cool about this

714
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,669
is I've taken the virus little chip give

715
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,529
it at my house we got all the good eNOS

716
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,059
data back from our shuttle and put it

717
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:14,099
right on my crack so it's really easy

718
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,479
for you to manipulate and all this was

719
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,369
done in another second to be a

720
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:19,909
right-click that's the beauty of this

721
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:21,928
typical automation approach is that

722
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,940
wonderfulness of having all your data

723
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,469
from many sources in one platform now if

724
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,070
you're paid for a private subscription

725
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:31,229
to something like SWAT or passive total

726
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,208
or premium buyers total intelligence

727
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:36,119
account you can also put those API keys

728
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:38,039
in here and use that in as well now

729
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,579
what's really cool is I have every aps

730
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:44,099
signature I have I can search from you

731
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:47,309
Texas and I can now cross search this

732
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:49,019
back to my organization I've used that

733
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:51,269
hash in the information I got from my

734
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,579
Moodle to resolve its and water cry so I

735
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:55,769
know hey this sample that's this part WC

736
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:56,940
filed over the after nasty well now I

737
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,489
can tell you if you want to cry

738
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,019
so is this from a strictly public

739
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:03,389
perspective right we haven't done

740
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,489
anything really significant yet they're

741
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:09,269
required in the internal data or audit

742
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:12,690
even anything yet so let's look at what

743
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:14,399
that would look like this is the same

744
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,469
chart after I've added some special

745
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,379
transforms that Everton and a lot of

746
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:21,329
native here now you'll notice we still

747
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:23,609
have our unknown actor icon we still

748
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,499
have our diskpart nobody identified and

749
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:26,668
the results in the house all these

750
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:28,019
errors that you see I don't know how

751
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,940
well you guys in the back and see them

752
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,399
are actually just relationship errors

753
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,949
that are pointed and directed towards

754
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:36,448
how we derived our data so one of the

755
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:38,129
reasons I like using graph based not

756
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:40,019
going through this is because as humans

757
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:42,238
we function in a neural network matter

758
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,309
which means that we function as a moral

759
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:46,649
graph that's how our brains actually

760
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,289
function that's how neurons fire which

761
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:51,718
means that for most individuals looking

762
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:54,209
at a spreadsheet or columns of data is

763
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:56,549
not as efficient or easy to understand

764
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:58,859
for the average person as something like

765
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,869
a graph and that's really how you take

766
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,908
your cheer one who just knows how to

767
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,289
look at data and right click and use

768
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:06,569
something but doesn't really understand

769
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,450
it this is how you can make that tier 3

770
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,310
level function of gathering the ontology

771
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,700
using it accessible to your cheer ones

772
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,929
and twos so now what do they do well

773
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,970
let's talk about the new things that are

774
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,590
on this diagram we've talked about the

775
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,330
sample that Hashem is pumped about the

776
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,040
new Texas be pulled back from a virus

777
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,689
photo let's talk about what's new here

778
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,250
so one of the things that I was able to

779
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,870
do be in integration I pulled in some

780
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,610
box and I've identified that this

781
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,590
particular sample actually came in

782
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,790
through a spam email someone what we

783
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,439
don't think there was an either

784
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,570
malicious enhancement or they visited

785
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,190
website in this case we're getting say

786
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,439
there was an attachment it was on

787
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,650
Christian at Tesla Tom's email that's

788
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,570
where it came from we can actually right

789
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,040
click on that and there's a transform

790
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,110
that's gonna run in the backend that we

791
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,480
developed then it will search our Active

792
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,240
Directory instances and say hey cool

793
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,130
almost Christian at Tesla comm who email

794
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,060
address is that that's gonna be resolved

795
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:01,250
us to me user and they have Christian

796
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,850
Nichols to know about email others okay

797
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,800
that's great

798
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,389
know what we she knows it all won't be

799
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,490
Sheen's does he own in this scenario

800
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,070
we're gonna have guys that I only have

801
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,900
one machine but if I have multiple that

802
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,310
will be good to know show up here so

803
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,780
think we're gonna resolve the machine is

804
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,790
we're gonna make a query to our access

805
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,129
management database so if you guys are

806
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:22,639
using ServiceNow you're maintaining a

807
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:25,160
asset inventory the SCM TB worker using

808
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,750
managed engine or using 98 other spice

809
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,640
works whenever you guys are using you're

810
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,970
gonna make a query to that and say hey

811
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,160
can you correlate this user to machines

812
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,140
and then give you the machine names and

813
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,710
their IP addresses and I'm gonna store

814
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,570
all that information in that new so

815
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,750
that's simple I have a relationship now

816
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:47,330
between the unknown after an email

817
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,120
account the user who owns the email the

818
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:52,490
machine that that piece of email was

819
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,649
delivered to and where the malware is

820
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,990
lately sitting and I can cross correlate

821
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,930
that not traded by guess in fact that is

822
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,640
where the malware is now we have that

823
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,770
relationship as well so I know that this

824
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,880
part of some piloting this part of easy

825
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:09,590
from some unknown actor which we know

826
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,810
results of this hash which we know is a

827
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,929
sample wanna try and add these new Texas

828
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:16,850
is in our environment that's great now

829
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,920
let's do something about that so now

830
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,560
that I have all the music

831
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,590
I want to find other machines in my

832
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,350
environment with the same sample or

833
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,820
things that are no new taxes so I'm

834
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,740
you're lying here I right-click on that

835
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,740
sample again and who's the source data

836
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,680
from below to do another query we have

837
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,670
custom transformed Oh unfortunately I

838
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,320
can't show you all a couple of

839
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,720
transforms I just don't have enough time

840
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,200
a food an example the basic one on the

841
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,520
next slide and a lot of those are very

842
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,230
proprietary didn't applying to

843
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,850
developing for and internal to yourself

844
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,520
so it's really hard to show this in a

845
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,990
presentation like this but in the Q&A

846
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,550
please do feel free to ask me was

847
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,470
involved in person at the ADA in

848
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:59,590
obtaining that view we can discuss it

849
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,530
privately that waits for contextualise

850
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,699
for you as well so now I'm taking that

851
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,690
hashtag search across my entire

852
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,820
organization

853
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,910
this can be via if you're using a white

854
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,320
listing tool or if you have a style

855
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,090
engineer environment across write

856
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,040
anything that's blogging the different

857
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,199
various hashes if you have the ability

858
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,290
degree EDR people to actually spin off

859
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,300
each search on every endpoint join up by

860
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,210
us you can create that integration as

861
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,310
well so I've now identified three more

862
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,960
computers with water cry on it and I

863
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:31,149
resolved those again via the theme

864
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,400
transform is previously moving in

865
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,590
Reverse seeing this doing a dns for work

866
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,450
versus reverse lookup shoot three more

867
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:41,370
users so now I'm going to have four

868
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:43,780
total affected users one key text and

869
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,479
for computers that I have to remediate

870
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:50,590
and I know that it's water crime awesome

871
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,810
right now if I wanted to I can take this

872
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,310
a step further and if I'm using the ER

873
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,570
from my environment I need add

874
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,399
transforms that keep the data out of

875
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,980
multigo and actually go out of

876
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,810
quarantine those machines remediate

877
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,790
those machines where possible run fire

878
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,740
stands on those machines again the

879
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,870
beauty of using an approach like this in

880
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,630
automation is you're limited only by

881
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,189
what kind of DNA you have access to what

882
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:17,000
kind of tools you have access to and

883
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:19,610
what you can program so we'll talk about

884
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
after this what a transform looks like

885
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,290
so what is it under the hood transform

886
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,930
look like if we're going to write our

887
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,879
own so this is just the basic Python one

888
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,490
multigo supports multiple languages

889
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,920
worth pearl shell script Python and I

890
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,050
believe Ruby under the hood out of box

891
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,370
you can add custom an integration for

892
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,649
different languages so you use whatever

893
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:43,459
you prefer and this is just a basic

894
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:45,890
search so we're going to use the multi

895
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,570
blue transform library to import that in

896
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,800
this case I also have no ancillary file

897
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,659
that I've written called callback

898
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,820
manager which manages my held out

899
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,820
queries for this example of code we're

900
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:58,010
going to be talking about how I resolved

901
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:01,850
the users and machines to IP addresses

902
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:03,920
and the user an email so I'm going to

903
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,770
have this multi old transform that I'm

904
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,060
going to instantiate here I'm then going

905
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,520
to create this variable that's going to

906
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,810
store my health app resolution so I'm

907
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,580
just going to call that all that breast

908
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,770
I'm going to make a call to my LDAP

909
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:19,189
manager which has a sub function called

910
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:20,900
user query which takes an input of an

911
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,150
email address so it's going to take the

912
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,650
email address I put in here which I

913
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,050
actually use my corporate email I have

914
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,710
in this example Christian and L about

915
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:32,360
global and I'm going to do a resolution

916
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,430
so I've actually put an abstract here of

917
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,330
what the data that is returned actually

918
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,740
looks like so I've been returned back a

919
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,879
object class which in this case was an i

920
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,830
network person Pio i sx account and a

921
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,830
shadow account so in this case where I

922
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,320
was clearing an open LDAP server because

923
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,129
I was running a Linux environment

924
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,789
for example my UID was Christian that's

925
00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:00,220
my username my surname was Nicholson my

926
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:01,809
given name Christian so this is just

927
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,580
like I said but you would expect to get

928
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:05,649
back from any open L that query right

929
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,960
now I've added a couple other things on

930
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:09,969
the backend that query in my old f9

931
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,860
restrictors auxilary data so you'll also

932
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,710
notice at the bottom that I asked for my

933
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,600
last night when I key and last nomachine

934
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,139
name something really cool to note about

935
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,610
this particular implementation if you're

936
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:23,408
familiar with Python you'll have notice

937
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,570
that all of the variables it's a

938
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,370
dictionary made up of lists and the

939
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,049
reason for that is what if I have

940
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,239
multiple items so in the case we're not

941
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,250
class I have multiple object classes

942
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,230
what if I have more than one email or

943
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,059
more than one you know have Elias

944
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,980
whatever have more than one class know

945
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:41,860
my keys so if I'm retaining all my T's

946
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:45,549
and I have an implementation like IP

947
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,110
blocks in in my environment I can

948
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:48,820
actually go back and get you know the

949
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,439
last five or ten you know an IP

950
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,939
addresses and then cross-correlate make

951
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,940
sure that there's no other infected

952
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,350
machines by one multiple devices and the

953
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,700
last note machine name so again we're

954
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,269
just gonna do a quick DNS lookup for

955
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,309
that one

956
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:03,009
so all of this data gets returned to me

957
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:04,178
I'm going to parse it out and I'm going

958
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,639
to use this entity so I'm going to

959
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:08,470
create a new identity an entity in multi

960
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:10,779
local language is every one of those

961
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:13,230
nodes that you saw on that map each one

962
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,339
is an entity and each one has a datatype

963
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,740
so in this case we're going to be making

964
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:20,199
a person datatype for a reference in a

965
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:22,418
user so I'm gonna say I want to add a

966
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,759
new entity using again I'm going to use

967
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:25,960
my multi code transform object here I'm

968
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,149
going to make a stuffed last called

969
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,609
empty identity I'm going to tell it that

970
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,440
it's a person object you can also define

971
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:34,029
custom objects if you have you know

972
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,530
custom servers or applications that you

973
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:39,429
want to make it more expansive it is

974
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:41,349
supported by the transforms library I'm

975
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,780
going to provide it Ella back res I'm

976
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:47,409
going to say give it variable one to

977
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,909
start with which is my username I'm

978
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,040
going to also tell the set of the paint

979
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,780
so we're setting the type of again to a

980
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,550
multi Godot person which is a class

981
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,429
authority

982
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,860
in my multi-view library basically says

983
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,180
hey this is a person type variable and

984
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,490
the reason that that's really important

985
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,049
useful is that's gonna drive what type

986
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,120
of transforms you can use multigo as

987
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,220
very context aware so if you're clicking

988
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,380
on my papers or the hash it'll provide

989
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,879
different options of what types of

990
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,640
transports you can run and when you

991
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,020
write a transform you're going to define

992
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,240
what types of objects it should work on

993
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,820
so it's really helpful for organization

994
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,649
you'll never try and run a DNS lookup on

995
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,000
a person's name it's obviously you're

996
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:27,630
not gonna really expect any results from

997
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,010
that I'm going to set a value so the

998
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,720
value is the actually data that I can

999
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,870
serve with which again it's going to be

1000
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,180
the first object in here and I'm also

1001
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:39,660
going to set an entity weight what the

1002
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,089
entity weight means is in my graph if I

1003
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,830
want to do a weight distribution to make

1004
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:46,020
it easier and more visible where I want

1005
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,850
certain entities to hold a higher value

1006
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,920
and there will be more visible as I'm

1007
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,900
dragging objects around that's what the

1008
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
week does it's really just a visual

1009
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,320
helpful identity and it defines your

1010
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,460
importance level of the oxygen we're

1011
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,170
discussing in multi the world I'm then

1012
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,520
going to tell it loves my display gonna

1013
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,260
look like what should the text that I

1014
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,020
see on my screen underneath the icon say

1015
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,180
and do I have any additional custom

1016
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,070
field in this case I do I have all this

1017
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,810
data here I want to be tied to those

1018
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,850
objects so I'm going to assign that data

1019
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,660
to the additional field object and what

1020
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,460
that will do is it'll actually

1021
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,680
automatically create via the library

1022
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,480
each field which in the multi goal

1023
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,440
interface lots of come up in a separate

1024
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,790
user pane that's very easy to see then

1025
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,250
I'm going to tell it to send a message

1026
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,420
to the user and let me know hey just

1027
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,590
give me a little comment that says yeah

1028
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,240
I completed my task

1029
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,760
I've run everything in the background it

1030
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,020
succeeded you can get fancy here again

1031
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,070
this is just a basic example you get

1032
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,500
error handling

1033
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,130
you know you need require API keys and

1034
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,290
they're missing

1035
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,570
you can add handling in here for that as

1036
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,308
well again it's really accessible so

1037
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,680
you're limited only

1038
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:50,059
imagination and then I'm going to tell

1039
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,859
us to return the output onto my screen

1040
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:55,099
and that's why I got all those custom

1041
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,180
knows all right so before I move on

1042
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:59,869
we're going to come back to the snow

1043
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,189
white before I'm in shock let's go and I

1044
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,059
just want to offer you some alternative

1045
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:04,160
popular options

1046
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,660
we talked a little bit about using

1047
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,118
something like misprints or anything

1048
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,288
else you have in your environment like I

1049
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,809
said they're really the sky is the limit

1050
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:15,140
you can swap out your data or whatever

1051
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:17,269
data you want to use I've actually taken

1052
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,489
this approach and this approach was

1053
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:21,680
actually really inspired by completely

1054
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,479
arbitrary other things so there's a

1055
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,459
really big tool by Palantir called

1056
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:27,589
Gotham that was designed for big data

1057
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,819
manipulation for those of you who are

1058
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:32,089
familiar with it it's predominantly an

1059
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:33,619
HR tool and they've added a cyber module

1060
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:36,380
onto it it's just another giant graph

1061
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:38,029
based out of the database it's very

1062
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,680
expensive and inaccessible to a lot of

1063
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:42,769
people which really led me to develop

1064
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,660
this approach for myself this is also

1065
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:46,879
the approach that I used as an MSSP

1066
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,199
model at a variety of different jobs

1067
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,829
that helped in the past when it

1068
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:53,029
delivered the service to a client now

1069
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:54,949
some of the other interesting things

1070
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,939
that you can do here like I said we

1071
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:57,410
touched it a little bit on

1072
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:59,359
you can add integrations to actually go

1073
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:01,819
out and do something with your data you

1074
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,078
can have auto report generation you can

1075
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:05,299
use these graphs to auto generate

1076
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,309
tickets for you and maintain ticket

1077
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:09,650
notes again because it's all automated

1078
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:11,239
your your limitation is really only by

1079
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,519
what kind of tools you have accessible

1080
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:16,219
what you want to integrate and what you

1081
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,779
have the ability to program so I

1082
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:20,449
promised we would come back to the stoic

1083
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:22,189
moment so there's no one moment here

1084
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:25,009
really comes down to a couple keys

1085
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:27,199
bounce so the exact implementation that

1086
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:29,119
I just showed you on this screen using

1087
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,189
the tools that I showed you to the

1088
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,739
maximum capacity would cost me about

1089
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:35,229
$100,000 in my first year now that gets

1090
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:38,150
me a virus little private license

1091
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:40,189
freezing ETI and that also gets me all

1092
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,809
the different ancillary multi know parts

1093
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:43,848
that I want for five users for the first

1094
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,249
year that cost jumps down to about

1095
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:47,989
$30,000 in the second year again this is

1096
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:49,799
just a pricing model for multi go full

1097
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:52,200
disclosure I have I'm not

1098
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,760
with turbo or multigo at all I'm just

1099
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,970
using those this reference prices for

1100
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,550
your program so assume that your total

1101
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,169
outlook over two years is gonna be about

1102
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,670
$170,000 now what is your savings

1103
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,100
where's your intern I'm an investment on

1104
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,030
that you're saving in time that's really

1105
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,830
going to be the biggest thing you're

1106
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:10,200
gonna save on here is your time that

1107
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,020
you're outputting so on average I've

1108
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,480
automated the job of a tier 3 tier 3 as

1109
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:18,600
a consultant generally ranges at a price

1110
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,180
range of about 200 to 350 dollars an

1111
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,200
hour depending on your consulting firm

1112
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,350
sometimes it's a little less than that

1113
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,790
I see that as low as 150 less than open

1114
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,770
scope consultants that are more at a

1115
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,810
tier 2 level or cure 1 level you're

1116
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:34,050
going to go up between $89 if they're

1117
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:36,210
more commodity skills so figure you're

1118
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,250
saving that much money per hour for

1119
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,960
every hour at Interstate now the whole

1120
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,630
example that I showed you from start to

1121
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,390
finish of that graph took me less than

1122
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,040
five minutes now let's get all that Thea

1123
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,870
typically between jumping between every

1124
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,279
interface identifying the interface

1125
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,900
identified where in the interface the

1126
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,030
people did who typically take the

1127
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,030
average analyst between 30 minutes to an

1128
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,890
hour so I heard used between 30 minutes

1129
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,290
and an hour's worth of work about five

1130
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,000
minutes BMI automation platform you and

1131
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:06,120
that's not counting if I were to add an

1132
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,940
EGR tool either custom or not custom on

1133
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,130
top of this now an alternative to multi

1134
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,810
go if you're a very open short source

1135
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,550
shop and you don't want to use something

1136
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,470
that creates a mist or something you can

1137
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,930
definitely develop something entirely on

1138
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,939
your own it's a very simple graph based

1139
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,290
database so you're welcome to use things

1140
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,060
like graph is and all the other

1141
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,970
wonderful Python libraries out there and

1142
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,529
develop all this on your own you can use

1143
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:32,490
things that are already pre-built like

1144
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:34,140
Mozgov from Mozilla or grr from Google

1145
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,910
and integrate with those platforms as

1146
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,410
well but this type of approach both of

1147
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,690
those have already include graph based

1148
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:42,420
management platforms inside of them so

1149
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,310
you can just build on top of that I'm

1150
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,630
still get the steam general how could

1151
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:50,520
look and feel so overall I'm seeing on

1152
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,240
average over 2 years the average

1153
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,259
employer consultant is between 115 to

1154
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,080
$140,000 if I were to insource known as

1155
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,180
a salary this total cost over two years

1156
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,359
it was about a month 70 so if you are

1157
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,519
saving over $100,000 a year

1158
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:07,189
with this type of communication and

1159
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,499
remember I'm also taking this data

1160
00:41:07,189 --> 00:41:11,449
accessible to a tier one who is far less

1161
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:14,538
expensive for me as an employee then

1162
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:16,339
it's year three there's a couple

1163
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,809
different other things we can talk about

1164
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:20,239
if you want to talk about return on

1165
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:22,309
investment on this one but I really do I

1166
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,199
got started to come close to the end of

1167
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:27,979
my time and I want to leave plenty of

1168
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:32,089
time for Q&A so with that said I'd like

1169
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:33,769
to jump to Q&A any questions about

1170
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,150
threat intelligence in general the

1171
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:37,488
approach I demonstrated here what

1172
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:41,119
platforms you can use feel free to shoot

1173
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:42,920
your hands up if not if you want to ask

1174
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,660
me out the presentation I'm more than

1175
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,709
happy to cut a little short so that you

1176
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,089
can approach individually I know

1177
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:48,948
sometimes I have one likes to ask

1178
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:52,369
questions would you share any tips or

1179
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:53,900
nothing it's about orientating the

1180
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:55,880
threat intelligence program to the

1181
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,979
business sure that's the next question

1182
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,420
the question was what are some tips

1183
00:41:57,979 --> 00:42:01,729
about worry achieving a threat Intel

1184
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,009
Berger to the business and it's a really

1185
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:05,660
hard question to answer in Greek because

1186
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:06,799
it's really gonna matter again we're

1187
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,449
going to come back to that context

1188
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:10,579
matters fly it's really gonna matter

1189
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:12,439
what your business is if you are a

1190
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:14,719
financial company you might want to pull

1191
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:16,308
in financial data from some more public

1192
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:17,719
sources or you might have internal

1193
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:19,489
sources or spreadsheets that you might

1194
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:21,109
want to pull into your popcorn's in

1195
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:23,299
order to identify where your assets are

1196
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:25,009
where your money Joe generated revenues

1197
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:40,390
are and what's important to you to

1198
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:42,890
protect but it's really good question so

1199
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,199
the question was what are some of the

1200
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,058
more exotic rulings and data sources

1201
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,989
that I've seen or integrated with the

1202
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:52,160
solution like this bad thing about that

1203
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:54,079
one per minute there's a pretty

1204
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,999
interesting one I've actually done

1205
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,799
ICS and scalar integrations with stuff

1206
00:42:55,999 --> 00:43:00,499
like this which would actually gather

1207
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:02,869
environment variables from og systems

1208
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:05,598
and environments my gathered performance

1209
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:06,380
data from 10 machines I'm a really big

1210
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,210
fan of you

1211
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,500
analytics I think that from a threat

1212
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,500
intelligence perspective that really

1213
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:15,050
helps to predict what might happen slunk

1214
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,000
and Ewing largest lung analytics and

1215
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,920
creating cremains bump reports and

1216
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,480
analytics observations are other really

1217
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,970
good data sources to pull and stuff like

1218
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,650
this that really gives you a baseline of

1219
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,950
what you should expect and you can then

1220
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,260
identify the difference there I think

1221
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:33,710
one of the most exotic ones was when I

1222
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,510
had to split up we were taken from a

1223
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,780
ticketing system where we started

1224
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,980
getting that data into the platform

1225
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,420
manipulating and enriching it pulling

1226
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,580
the ADA from about 20 different sources

1227
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,170
and then pushing it back out and then

1228
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,240
distributing into two separate kicking

1229
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,920
systems while also managing all the

1230
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,600
synchronous data that one was probably

1231
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,610
when the most complex and exotic things

1232
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:57,080
I've ever had to do there was a lot of

1233
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:58,340
parsing of proprietary formats that had

1234
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:03,970
to be done so it made it a really

1235
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,970
interesting implementation anyone else

1236
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:13,310
as far as parsing company emails to just

1237
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,220
say hey I'm concerned about this issue

1238
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:18,620
and then it just searches the email for

1239
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,450
keywords in there and tries to figure

1240
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,150
out what the threat is

1241
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:26,029
what's researching yes so I've actually

1242
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:29,810
so the question was around has it gone

1243
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,310
as far as you look at company emails and

1244
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,900
actually read the bodies and get

1245
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:35,090
information out of those and then meet

1246
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,160
the students based on it so actually for

1247
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:39,650
a recent client of mine we didn't want

1248
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,210
to buy a fishing solution we wrote and

1249
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,460
develop and python an entire fishing

1250
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,280
solution engine did just that we would

1251
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,600
actually go ahead and query for emails

1252
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,200
that were reported into but you go to

1253
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,060
email box read them parse out the body

1254
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,759
automatically can submit all of the URLs

1255
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,860
and the attachments to every sandbox we

1256
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,210
had the environment so across canoe on

1257
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,060
fire

1258
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,560
ETI weeds in it the hashes as well as

1259
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,220
the actual samples for analysis in the

1260
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,020
sandbox

1261
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,759
give all that data back generate a

1262
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,210
ticket pull it into the Intelligence

1263
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,920
Platform

1264
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,430
and make a decision on it we also

1265
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,440
actually added some machine learn

1266
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,598
in there with key words to trigger on so

1267
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,369
we were able to identify if there was a

1268
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,579
DLP event occurring in that email as

1269
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:22,319
well or compared against a list of

1270
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,260
pre-existing emails or emails we've seen

1271
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,569
in the past as well we did a lot of that

1272
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,309
with regex the side prize which I'm

1273
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:31,770
actually currently working on is I

1274
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:53,460
started writing a entire library in

1275
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:54,660
Python for doing regex DLP definitely so

1276
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,309
the question was are there any gotchas

1277
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,379
when you're developing intelligence

1278
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:59,640
program that I've run into or discovered

1279
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,710
along the way and what kind of problems

1280
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,879
have I run into a lot of times

1281
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,470
especially when doing like a mass

1282
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,690
emigration like this in a threat Intel

1283
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,399
program you start to experience a lot of

1284
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,109
people coming out of the woodwork snafu

1285
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,210
for access to data that they should

1286
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:14,098
never have access to or might not have

1287
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,349
had access to and on the same side of

1288
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,970
that coin you might find that you start

1289
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:19,770
to discover a lot of data that is

1290
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,209
unknown to your organization a lot of

1291
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,609
shadow by key groups that now he can

1292
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,109
become managed you're not as mezzanine

1293
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:26,910
intelligence analyst who's discovering

1294
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:28,890
all these things and now sweeper access

1295
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,770
to all these things you're not always

1296
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:35,190
the most well-liked person because

1297
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,660
you'll find that you start tramping on

1298
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,130
some people stomping grounds and they

1299
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,549
don't taking control or making

1300
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,260
suggestions they might not like as much

1301
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:45,059
so my best piece of advice is in in my

1302
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,650
experience the best thing you can do and

1303
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:48,900
you're trying to build these programs to

1304
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:50,660
mitigate things like that is build good

1305
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,069
working relationships with other teams

1306
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,529
you know follow the best principles of

1307
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:57,270
never burn a bridge and I always like to

1308
00:46:55,529 --> 00:46:59,160
approach a conversation when I need to

1309
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,660
ask them for something I always like to

1310
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,009
be prepared to something to offer them

1311
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,390
in return that I know they're going to

1312
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,130
want that really makes another

1313
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,299
conversation

1314
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:08,540
getting those integrations up and

1315
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,550
running a lot smoother also having good

1316
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,340
content user awareness training ahead of

1317
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:15,020
time before you say to use hey we have

1318
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,270
this really cool security newsletter you

1319
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,259
could subscribe to you can still find

1320
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,270
that there are a lot of people in your

1321
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,100
organization who are you know they're

1322
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,380
know interested in seeking any advantage

1323
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,029
or any special insider thing that they

1324
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,740
can get out of your company they're

1325
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,120
interested in it just because it makes

1326
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,209
them feel special because they have

1327
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,589
something that's restricted so you'll

1328
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,300
notice that a lot of people might come

1329
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:38,150
and ask for these things without having

1330
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,890
a real good understanding of what that

1331
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,390
it is and that's why you know when I

1332
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,890
first started building critical program

1333
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,420
please don't we ever have Monday to eat

1334
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:46,520
and I learned very quickly that was a

1335
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,320
bad idea and that's why I now stay when

1336
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,020
I present to you I would really suggest

1337
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,180
you have to at minimum are restricted in

1338
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,370
a non-restrictive the restricted one

1339
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:58,190
normally is better suited for having a

1340
00:47:55,370 --> 00:48:00,620
very business contextualized high-level

1341
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:02,570
work and also very technical details as

1342
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,950
a relation or ganesh n' and then the

1343
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,870
public consumption for your internal

1344
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:08,299
company itself is really good for just

1345
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:10,130
having that high-level no giddy gritty

1346
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,810
details and why it was mitigated just

1347
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:16,870
that it was mitigated by something you

1348
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:16,870
had excellent question anyone else

1349
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,529
that's a really good question how do i

1350
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,740
measure and determine my success of my

1351
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:33,200
Intel program and the answer is really a

1352
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,029
little bit obstruct your your return on

1353
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,830
investment and your success of your

1354
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:39,410
program is again going to be subject to

1355
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,670
your definition of success and before

1356
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,470
you start building a program you should

1357
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,290
really define what your success that the

1358
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,000
program means that might be metrics that

1359
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:49,940
might be your your definition of success

1360
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,430
is that you have within your company of

1361
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,440
500 people 100 people subscribe to the

1362
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,879
public newsletter because then you can

1363
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,710
check the box on your user awareness

1364
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,490
training and say yes my users are aware

1365
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:02,730
of security risks that they're facing

1366
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:05,209
musician your success definition make me

1367
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,650
I want my see stone to be aware of

1368
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,390
emerging threats that might affect your

1369
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:11,369
organization and how they affect us so

1370
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:14,190
that they are better prepared by either

1371
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:15,300
reporter ask them hey aqua Cox did you

1372
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,619
know ahead of time about this

1373
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,140
vulnerability that you just got popped

1374
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:22,470
on or what are you doing to solve this

1375
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,900
vulnerability or mitigate this threat

1376
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,490
that your competitor is now facing that

1377
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,040
those are really important things that

1378
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,419
you can use to measure success and your

1379
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,920
bearing for success your mileage may

1380
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,540
vary it's really gonna depend on what

1381
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,420
the goal of your friend Intel program is

1382
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,670
and the reason for instantiate it you

1383
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,380
know if like many companies your your

1384
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,970
instantiated on thread becomes perfect

1385
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,619
this aids a buzzword and it's new and

1386
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,689
hot and popular in industry right now

1387
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,650
and you're you went to a conference like

1388
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,600
this and you heard them talk about

1389
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,650
threat Intel and we're like oh cool

1390
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,670
that's the thing that I should be doing

1391
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,650
right now

1392
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:55,290
that's probably not a good reason for

1393
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,430
you to have a program and if that's why

1394
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,950
you want to program you should really

1395
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:01,109
think a step back and decide well why do

1396
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,399
I want it jumping to actually being in

1397
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:05,820
the presentation talking about what it

1398
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,580
gets me and keep those things and use

1399
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,600
those and metrics has my intelligence

1400
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,310
led to me

1401
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,350
patching something that was then spotted

1402
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:14,820
in the wild later on so did not get

1403
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,040
again that threat that's a really good

1404
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,350
metric or threat Intel programs was I

1405
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,850
able to prevent something that I know

1406
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,160
what if otherwise affected me

1407
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:26,640
did someone who has appeared to me in

1408
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,350
industry get popped by something that I

1409
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,140
prevented because of an article I read

1410
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:35,430
or because my analyst according to fall

1411
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:36,600
out ahead of time one of the other

1412
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,790
things that I really didn't mention a

1413
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,500
lot during talk is you can really take a

1414
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,630
purple teaming aspect to this that's

1415
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,430
that red plus blue team methodology you

1416
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:46,560
can add vulnerability data in here pen

1417
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,839
testing results one of the most popular

1418
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,060
integrations that I've done in that

1419
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,730
graph based platform was actually

1420
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,830
thinking like next rows necess

1421
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,270
that data and vulnerability data and

1422
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,430
cross correlating it to the threat

1423
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:00,050
because then I can come down and say all

1424
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,540
right this is the threat you chose to

1425
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:04,070
either accept or mitigate the risk this

1426
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,080
is why you're not opt and that really

1427
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:08,810
gives you again that extra context on

1428
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,640
what happened why it happened why it

1429
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,840
cost what it did and how much it

1430
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,190
actually could have potentially cost you

1431
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,040
all right if there's no other questions

1432
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:21,580
then thank you guys you've been a

1433
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,580
wonderful audience
