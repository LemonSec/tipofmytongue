1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,329
well thank you all for joining I really

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,970
appreciate everybody sitting on this

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,629
panel it's an important topic for force

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,120
development it's something that you hear

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,190
a lot about attention newbies we don't

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,378
talk about things that are going on some

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,840
things that might be happening so I'm

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,640
gonna longer solo wait a woman but I

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,480
wanted to introduce flying to cope Alice

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,400
right next to me is James

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
Niemeyer or a principal for tech Valley

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,460
High School James you were previously a

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,620
principal at red jacket red jacket which

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,969
is a more traditional school so Tech

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,209
Valley for those of you who aren't

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:42,030
familiar is a regional public high

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,649
school student poly campus so we have a

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,110
very small number of students 130

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,230
students but they're for about 31

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,719
different districts and you are

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,319
currently going to sage Commonwealth for

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,090
more

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,640
yep so I'm working on my doctorate at

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,160
Sage and education educational

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:10,229
leadership cool and next to you Ethan

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:12,270
from Excelsior College yes is a entirely

27
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,610
online regionally accredited school we

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,890
have programs all across the spectrum

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm in charge of the cyber security

30
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,689
program we have just a few hundred

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,089
students involved that's off the gun we

32
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,548
are a center for academic excellence so

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,220
we are in compliance with the DoD comm

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,490
lines I also run the IT program which is

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,429
a quite a bit larger 1,000 1,500 to

36
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,110
2,000 students a lot of which are

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,070
military in about the interactive

38
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,899
service or that is I'd say the authority

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm also a faculty member at the

40
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,869
University of Albany and they're in the

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,869
business program

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,050
cybersecurity business intelligence

43
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,929
that's our thing

44
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,789
I notice that you're a virus out which

45
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,700
me that you have a master's in

46
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,290
philosophy I have a master's in

47
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,840
philosophy religion I have a master's in

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,460
information science and also working on

49
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,450
my doctorate and informatics

50
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,650
specializing in encryption well so when

51
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,829
the numbers get higher does it become

52
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:19,360
like religion or the encryption it can

53
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:21,040
more leads to introspection good

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,170
so I'm Ryan with the Center for an

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,120
insecurity some of you may know us from

56
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,649
all the presentation bits of our staff

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,050
come and talk about that's like to work

58
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,580
in ourself but for those after they we

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,320
are nonprofit organization actually

60
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,200
located across the river East Greenbush

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,910
New York where we serve to protect all

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,820
50 states as well as issue allows best

63
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,170
practices and other guidances so from

64
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
that perspective I'm gonna set the stage

65
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,040
here we're going to kind of each of the

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,959
individuals on my left here we'll talk a

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,579
little bit about that perspective but

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,519
first we set the stage by workforce as

69
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,860
you saw in the description this is a big

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,780
app here you know you're you're all here

71
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,010
to learn more about cybersecurity or as

72
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,299
such as you professionals yourselves

73
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,760
sort of pick up different lessons I

74
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,709
think you know that there is a shortage

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,630
of people with your knowledge in the

76
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,290
marketplace it's projected that we'll be

77
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,269
able to million people shy come 2021 and

78
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,000
that number of teens go up as we fail to

79
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,370
fill the gaps you need to and with

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,100
regards to the future of our workforce

81
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,660
and this is critical because as the

82
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,459
cyber threats continue to grow we don't

83
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,530
have the people that we need a place to

84
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,290
deal with it so we have increasing cost

85
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:30,010
of attacks we have increased cost of

86
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,298
breaches we have a situation where if

87
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,950
you have to think about this or the

88
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,709
point of use law enforcement as if we

89
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,810
had more crime but less cops we have

90
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,700
more fires those firefighters we have

91
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,900
more disease but less doctors and that

92
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,980
number is he used to travel

93
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,690
exponentially one way or the other so

94
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,280
how do we convert this there are a lot

95
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,090
of national standards to help you

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,590
describe there are the

97
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,569
standards which are issued by this which

98
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,569
makes a great name for really what is a

99
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,250
career pathway there's a lot of

100
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,859
different funding and grant programs to

101
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,900
help people get into cybersecurity there

102
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,030
are programs that are being used to help

103
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,980
fund educational programs to help people

104
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,930
get a cybersecurity but ultimately the

105
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,609
challenge we face is one where people

106
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,930
need to think about their career people

107
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,640
in to think about what they want to do

108
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,190
with their lives and see cybersecurity

109
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,680
as an avenue to be successful in

110
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,358
cybersecurity jobs as maybe no pay very

111
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,739
well thinking sometimes pay as much as

112
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,590
seventy eighty thousand dollars for any

113
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:27,650
college the average salary in DC for

114
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,900
established professionals $116,000 so

115
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,099
these are jobs or not you know jobs the

116
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,260
scenes that these are jobs with high

117
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,000
demand high availability and you know

118
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,560
potentially we're both working abilities

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,330
potentially the ability to work across

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,100
schedule in the clothes that you desire

121
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,000
you know I'm wearing a suit right here

122
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,800
because I fail to get the memo but you

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,820
know next time I'll wear my photography

124
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,800
teacher the the audience's that we work

125
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,719
with regards to cybersecurity you know

126
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,010
it's a very relaxed workforce so why are

127
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,020
not more people getting into it why are

128
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,000
we failing to fill this gap as time goes

129
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,020
by so well that James need to kind of

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
talk a little bit about some of the

131
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,070
thought process with regards to what

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,630
different organizations are doing to fix

133
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,340
this now I have a couple questions for

134
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,020
them and then return over to you guys in

135
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,340
the audience ask questions you know

136
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,049
ultimately the lessons I want you to

137
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,880
take away from this is that you know our

138
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,930
community is taking action with James

139
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,820
and Ethan will speak to things that

140
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,260
they're familiar of whether it's their

141
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,030
own institutions or the businesses they

142
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,169
work with they're looking to hire bring

143
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,359
more people into the stem and

144
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,159
cybersecurity fields but also you'll

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,660
have ability to think about how do you

146
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,919
look your own career path and where can

147
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,330
you fit into the cybersecurity industry

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,400
so whether you're trying to break in

149
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,919
transfer move around in the space there

150
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,409
is no sort of opportunities and no short

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,150
of demand people like you who get cyber

152
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,440
security so let's talk a little bit

153
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,388
about tech rounding out in the audience

154
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,760
here Bobo what's going on there and some

155
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,710
of things you see in terms of how people

156
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,690
are trying to get more kids into stem at

157
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,960
cyber security at the high school level

158
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,650
sure so I'll back it way up and just

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,229
tell you

160
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:58,448
a little bit about me and so I started

161
00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:01,758
my path in education as a kid who wasn't

162
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,350
like demographically speaking wouldn't

163
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,550
have been anybody that somebody would

164
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,800
have pegged to be a principal of the

165
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,889
school or maybe even a graduate of a

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,330
school and certainly not a doctoral

167
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,759
student somebody who's running an

168
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,800
organization like that badly so I'm

169
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,570
pretty blessed but just to tell you

170
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,150
about like from that perspective as a

171
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,580
student when I was in high school if I

172
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:27,440
think about from a limited perspective

173
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:30,530
of the menu of jobs that I knew existed

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,479
I knew of about three so I knew that my

175
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,750
mom worked in a grocery store I knew I

176
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,610
didn't want to do that and I also knew

177
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,840
my teachers did because they were the

178
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,030
people that were in front of me every

179
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,099
day and so the thing that I ended up

180
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,229
choosing between wasn't between

181
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:48,409
cybersecurity and all these other fields

182
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,000
and education it was really between so I

183
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,610
want to work retail or in a grocery

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,810
store or did I want to work in education

185
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,530
because those are the two things on my

186
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:00,919
menu and so really it's been my goal as

187
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:05,330
a school administrator to try to make

188
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:07,099
kids menus as broad as possible so that

189
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,039
they are exposed to all of these

190
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:12,139
different fields and so I did that as a

191
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,639
principal at Red Jacket in western New

192
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:19,250
York we we have some business

193
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:21,620
partnerships and really those are pretty

194
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,550
limited in scope so if you read the

195
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,080
literature on school business

196
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,780
partnerships you'll find that a lot of

197
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,909
people you know a lot of them are pretty

198
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,609
shallow in terms of what they're

199
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:41,990
actually accomplishing so they're kind

200
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:43,760
of like more of a I guess a a glossy

201
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,590
thing to put on a brochure than an

202
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,199
actual meaningful partnership that's

203
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,549
causing something to change at Tech

204
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,310
Valley it's not really like that

205
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,920
so Tech Valley one of the institutions

206
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,510
that helped found Tech Valley was

207
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,820
organization that we have in house which

208
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,920
is a Business Alliance made up of 35

209
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,200
different businesses those 35 different

210
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,300
businesses cover a lot of different

211
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,570
grounds so we have so Ryan's our

212
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,250
Business Alliance Tyler hallways also

213
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,330
are our Business Alliance but we have

214
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,080
people from lots of other different

215
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,520
fields and higher ed and nonprofits and

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,990
the goal of these folks is really to

217
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,440
advise us on the curriculum that we

218
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:24,890
teach so they're not just there to like

219
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,690
you know put an under resume that they

220
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,130
have done some kind of community

221
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,710
outreach they're actually there to

222
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,419
advise us on what we do and we don't ask

223
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,189
them for money or anything like that all

224
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,799
we're looking for is insight into what

225
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,000
we should be teaching that's relevant to

226
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,500
the world that we live in in the

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,530
community that we're in and so they

228
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,179
provide us with that and they can work

229
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,420
with us in lots of different ways so

230
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,310
they can come in to speak with our kids

231
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,349
they we also run an experience a

232
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,660
learning program where kids can go out

233
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,020
and do internships during junior and

234
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,819
senior year they can go out as small

235
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,020
groups streeter year and senior year

236
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,560
they go out and do individual

237
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,079
internships and freshmen and sophomore

238
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,880
year we bring kids out during that time

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,100
period to see what different businesses

240
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,450
look like and the goal isn't really for

241
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,770
them to find the thing that they're

242
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,870
going to be doing for the rest of their

243
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,819
life but really just to broaden their

244
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,760
menu and maybe to check some things off

245
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,940
that they don't want to do so for

246
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,790
example I would guess that not a lot of

247
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,250
kids understand would understand what

248
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,689
Ryan was talking about in terms of you

249
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,370
know what I mean like I can work from

250
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,030
home what does that look like they don't

251
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,890
have a parent that does it and so

252
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,410
opening your doors the doors of your

253
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,360
organization's to show kids what it

254
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,370
might be like to work there and having

255
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,590
your folks come out to schools to talk

256
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,010
to them about what what it is would

257
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,890
really help a lot in terms of getting

258
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:56,569
people to consider this as a viable

259
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,699
career and also not just looking for

260
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,910
college kids with credentials and lots

261
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,590
of

262
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,510
background to do internships in your

263
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,250
school but to think about maybe high

264
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,330
school kids with some advanced computer

265
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,740
skills and also to kind of expand beyond

266
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,810
what you might be looking for in

267
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,820
traditional job applicants to look at

268
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,560
like what are those skills and qualities

269
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,720
that you want people to have besides

270
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,329
just the credentials that you want them

271
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,510
to have earned so those critical

272
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,760
thinking skills those other things and

273
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,240
working with schools to help develop

274
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,400
projects to instill those traits in the

275
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,250
kids at the schools like you got to

276
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:38,060
actually be a person who's willing to go

277
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,240
into the schools and be of assistance

278
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,849
and helping to guide program so I think

279
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,540
if people are willing to put in the time

280
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,700
they can fix this it's nothing that you

281
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,500
can do by just you know saying you

282
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,230
belong to an organization and checking a

283
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,090
box and it's not anything that you can

284
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,930
solve either by putting up a website

285
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,060
with a bunch of tools on it that's a you

286
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,430
know how best to develop her that you

287
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,310
know the workforce you actually have to

288
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,989
go and make relationships and so that's

289
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,540
that's what I would encourage is that

290
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,980
people you know find a person like me

291
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,310
and their community and make a

292
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,080
relationship with them that you can use

293
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,589
to kind of have an impact directly on

294
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,970
kids and this was very good jimson your

295
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,740
opacity then it will say that the

296
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:30,080
students in technology are really quite

297
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:32,540
amazing I went to their science fair and

298
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,540
it's amazing it like you know Jennifer

299
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,339
got the corn and drones and solar panels

300
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,719
and just really talented bunch of

301
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,340
students so if you got a peer to you to

302
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,310
participate or learn about this program

303
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,540
or if you know someone who's a stem

304
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,670
student interested standing or wall

305
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,439
program definitely recommend the high

306
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,930
school and again whole school is where I

307
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,110
am on their advisory yeah but it's a

308
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,729
great program either significantly you

309
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,390
you sit on the unique point because you

310
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:02,810
actually lecture at Albany as well as

311
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,010
Excelsior so which is a more virtual

312
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,959
University as opposed to physical

313
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,910
university so how it was high rent

314
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,710
really approaching this challenge of

315
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,740
bringing kids into the cybersecurity of

316
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,650
people in cybersecurity I can speak more

317
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:19,850
directly to the Excelsior model since

318
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:24,529
that's the one that I'm overseeing we

319
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:27,050
are really picking up where secondary

320
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,000
education leaves off we would hope for

321
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,670
things where you were asking for

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,950
normalization of this sort of job of

323
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,900
cybersecurity jobs any go gage to make

324
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,410
it seem like something that anyone could

325
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:42,550
aspire to that it's a normal job from

326
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,270
our perspective we're taking people

327
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,310
non-traditional students students that

328
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,380
aren't stepping directly into a

329
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,569
four-year school looking at students

330
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,250
that in two-year schools and then they

331
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,140
want to learn more they wanna make sure

332
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,900
that they can get a promotion after they

333
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,910
start that sense you want more skills

334
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:04,250
will have a better or more diverse

335
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:05,719
well-rounded background before they sort

336
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,520
of confined themselves to one aspect of

337
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,440
cybersecurity

338
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,020
we are taking those students and we are

339
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,580
helping them finish their degrees we are

340
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,600
also looking at work heavily with

341
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:21,530
military services again we have many

342
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,690
many active service members in the maybe

343
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,339
in the Air Force the army all all three

344
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,950
of those branches have students that

345
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,860
come to us while they are serving and

346
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,780
when they are on shore shortly do they

347
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,940
want to work we do occasionally work

348
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,250
with people that are serving in tours on

349
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,480
submarines let me create little them

350
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,790
with lessons ahead of time when they are

351
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,339
able to complete them as they can while

352
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,530
they are submerged so they are able to

353
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,709
service together they then submit their

354
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,660
work for us so we are helping them

355
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:52,609
prepare for either advancement in the

356
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,990
military or when they leave the military

357
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,930
we were looking to make sure that

358
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:00,320
perfect prepared to enter the workforce

359
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,390
I suppose the larger question is how

360
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,040
what are we doing to get more

361
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,810
yeah in terms of this how do we humpin

362
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,810
in more shoes and interested

363
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,880
and I think that that part is is

364
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,670
something about I get a more complicated

365
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:21,000
question the more people see security

366
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,550
breaches once we look back and we see

367
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,600
the target as being an early breach that

368
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,699
really caught a lot of people's

369
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,820
attention finding out for instance that

370
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,810
they had a pre warning of essentially an

371
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,910
inevitable breach or we look at breaches

372
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,869
like Ashley Madison that became

373
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:55,819
popularized with the with the television

374
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:58,260
show with the Daily Show the British one

375
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,260
yes the John Oliver show where he did a

376
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,939
long skinny about 15-20 minutes with

377
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,819
about Ashley Madison how it really

378
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,830
affected a particular town in Canada

379
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,110
where they had something like one in

380
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:13,650
five married people were on that website

381
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,450
which when the people that were using -

382
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,449
the medicine to meet someone else when

383
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,060
their client list was revealed it put a

384
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,320
potential a large number of people in

385
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,689
jeopardy whose the relationships in

386
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,630
jeopardy those seem small but then when

387
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,460
we look we move on to Equifax where we

388
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,070
have millions of people that were I

389
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,710
suppose once these stories once these

390
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,910
exposures become real and they see them

391
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,800
in the media they see if they read them

392
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,290
out about Facebook or Twitter or they

393
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,380
see it on the television that at least

394
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,290
puts into the public mind the security

395
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,610
is an issue that we needed the people on

396
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:53,130
the front lines that are doing something

397
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:55,680
about this higher education is really we

398
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,570
are we're playing game of catch-up these

399
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,280
problems had existed prior there was

400
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,410
notice that there were there were there

401
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,370
was a wave a tsunami coming of these

402
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,920
issues the 2008/2009 there was an

403
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,360
unfunded mandate that suggested about

404
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,800
for instance all critical infrastructure

405
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,959
have a cybersecurity program

406
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,550
the security professionals in place that

407
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,560
we have procedures and policies to make

408
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,689
sure that everything that our

409
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,410
civilization essentially relies on is

410
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,830
safe that's great what didn't happen is

411
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,640
that we didn't tell students that hey we

412
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:33,029
have jobs for you going forward granted

413
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,949
at the time the economy was in the tank

414
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:38,140
and right now we have unemployment

415
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,430
that's hovering around a four percent so

416
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,230
it's difficult to take people that are

417
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,680
near comfortable and telling them that

418
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,060
now is the time to transition but for

419
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,819
those that are more forward-looking if

420
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,560
we can get teachers at high schools or

421
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,839
even better middle school or even

422
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,939
parents involved early and tell them

423
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,470
that there are professional jobs out

424
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,630
there that pay well schooling helps it's

425
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,240
not always required at least that's not

426
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:07,030
to gave the entry-level positions and

427
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,319
you don't need to work the traditional

428
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,030
route you don't need to spend four years

429
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,470
in the school you can start with two

430
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,678
years sweep and start right out of high

431
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:18,240
school you can dip your toes in and we

432
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,610
can use your skills your talents your

433
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:34,300
nativeness to the digital environment to

434
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:36,010
help forestall any future crisis if

435
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,840
there's one thing especially as a

436
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,940
cybersecurity practitioner so there's

437
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,189
one thing you wish somebody pursuing

438
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,669
this career field knew going into it

439
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,760
what would that one thing be I would say

440
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:52,650
I would make sure that they knew that it

441
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,660
is not all the jobs know that are all

442
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:58,030
strictly under the rubric of or the

443
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,149
heading of computer science that there

444
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,009
are application based practitioners that

445
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,199
people that are familiar with sets of

446
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:07,809
tools that are in common use that are

447
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,429
able to both monitor and sort of prevent

448
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,259
keep an eye on the systems that we have

449
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,460
in place and there are people that we

450
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,799
have that are on the forefront of

451
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,539
research that they're looking for new

452
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,749
malware that's being produced we're

453
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:23,469
looking for a worth more structure

454
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:28,089
approaches overall to protecting our

455
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:29,440
infrastructure from attack commonly when

456
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:31,239
I talk to students they think oh I don't

457
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,580
have enough math you know I haven't

458
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:36,309
taken calculus form or I don't have this

459
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,389
thing I don't have the verified skill

460
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,389
set that will allow me to do this

461
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:42,459
instead we have practitioners who rely

462
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:44,049
believes use tools on a day to day basis

463
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,389
they're using the dashboards to model

464
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,070
their system traffic they're not getting

465
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:49,689
down into the nitty-gritty of what's

466
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,359
happening in a pack of them but they can

467
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,129
see that there are problems building up

468
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,478
and they can address resources where

469
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:58,599
they're needed and those people need

470
00:18:55,479 --> 00:19:02,229
just as much as the deep research guys

471
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:04,330
and just like Google is changing their

472
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:06,159
their Lord of sub-prime guide for hiring

473
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,460
they need people that can work on teams

474
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:12,369
it's not about one person sitting alone

475
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,989
in the dirty ops room banging away to

476
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:16,449
keyboard it's about people that are

477
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:18,879
being able to pass the torch to another

478
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,369
shift or to work in a group to try to

479
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:28,178
plug one happen instead of just relying

480
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:31,209
on one - in one perspective you know I

481
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:34,239
know you broke a lot of employers so I'm

482
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,070
sorry how are they approaching this as

483
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,739
Ethan said that there's there's more

484
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,359
than just dark rooms and keyboards in

485
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:49,599
please you know how are they approaching

486
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:51,789
this well so I think one of the more a

487
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,678
couple of examples come to mind so the

488
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:54,999
first example was an example I heard

489
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,570
from one of our business partners who

490
00:19:54,999 --> 00:20:00,969
works at IBM who said that now they are

491
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,428
like specifically targeting people who

492
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:05,379
have gaming degrees there's a lot of

493
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,970
kids who have want to go into video

494
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:09,899
games

495
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,690
that might surprise you but to kind of

496
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,370
target those folks who have these have

497
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,170
these skills and also critical thinking

498
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,100
skills and the other things that people

499
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:23,160
might need in this industry and to kind

500
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,980
of draw like what is like an abundance

501
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,620
of people who have those degrees those

502
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,140
credentials over into cybersecurity and

503
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,719
the other one that I had seen that's I

504
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,070
think pretty interesting is we have

505
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,400
another person on our pan on our

506
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,540
business alliance from Albany can code

507
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,790
and Albany can cause a really

508
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,370
interesting organization that is seeking

509
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,610
to educate multiple generations at the

510
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:52,290
same time so when they do events in the

511
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:54,149
evening to for kids they also invite

512
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:57,240
parents along with the parents who might

513
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,650
be underemployed or you know employed in

514
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,510
different fields that aren't maybe

515
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,000
careers that they want to stay in

516
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:06,540
forever so I think that those are both

517
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,290
really interesting approaches to getting

518
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,090
more people involved in this field

519
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,310
that's a kind of expertise in there

520
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,790
because you have a philosophy religion

521
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,899
background and I'm assuming that there

522
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,030
are other things we attract around the

523
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,530
true to security but what are some of

524
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,120
the things that help people from

525
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,560
different backgrounds get into

526
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,000
cybersecurity say you didn't go to the

527
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,889
college for computer science or say

528
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,550
you're thinking or knowledge how can you

529
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:37,770
get into cybersecurity as I think it

530
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,740
would depend on my target audience I was

531
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,420
targeting people at high school kids

532
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,530
about HR still there's still modeling

533
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,390
their behavior so they need to be

534
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,870
exposed to it they need to know that

535
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,920
there are there are job pathways that

536
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,280
there are people that are willing to

537
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,550
take the time to show them not only that

538
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,780
it's these jobs are out there but these

539
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,490
are things that you can do at home to

540
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,490
prepare yourself for that sort of work

541
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,310
if I were approaching an older student I

542
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,240
would say we have to assess everything

543
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,500
their background do you have

544
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,190
problem-solving skills

545
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,460
now do you know how far you

546
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:19,220
with you know the latest release Culley

547
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,140
I do do you know these tools No - can

548
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,380
you can you solve problems can you think

549
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,760
it's just systemically can you think

550
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,400
logically can you follow something from

551
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,070
the beginning to end I would even go so

552
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,560
far as to say do you watch cop shows

553
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,360
anything that gets people thinking mmm

554
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,919
I there are there's an adversarial

555
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,929
approach out there people are trying to

556
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,510
get into something what can I do to

557
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:47,840
follow what they're doing and what if I

558
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:50,990
were on the other side of that way to

559
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,220
follow up on that so secondary education

560
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:57,920
has really done a pretty bad job of

561
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:00,380
teaching anything beyond what the

562
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,570
typical core academic subjects might be

563
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,520
so one of the things that we do that's a

564
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,399
little different and other project-based

565
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,940
learning schools do too is we explicitly

566
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,060
teach like so-called 21st century skills

567
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,460
to kids and also assess them on those

568
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:21,159
skills and report those skills out and

569
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,980
so if so for example even more than

570
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,990
focusing on technology we focus on

571
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,330
collaboration communication technology

572
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,850
and information literacy and agency in

573
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,490
self-direction so we grade those things

574
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,659
on every single project that we do we

575
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,670
put them under four cards we

576
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:42,170
specifically teach skills that are

577
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:45,350
related to those outcomes and we even

578
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:50,510
tell colleges how kids do in those areas

579
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:52,639
and the we had to develop standards of

580
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,280
our own because New York State as it

581
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,600
provided standards for those things and

582
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,780
so if more schools were convinced that

583
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,810
it's not enough to just teach the

584
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,639
traditional subjects and that you know

585
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,560
schools have all bought into this idea

586
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,500
that every teacher is a teacher of

587
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,080
reading schools also need to buy into

588
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,059
the idea that every teacher needs

589
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,840
to be a teacher of information literacy

590
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:23,620
of critical thinking and standards need

591
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,299
to be developed for those things too and

592
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,389
we need to start assessing that in our

593
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,769
schools so that students have the kinds

594
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,799
of skills that are going to help them

595
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,630
when they need to go onto the field and

596
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,029
they're being interviewed by a cyber

597
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,500
professional everybody needs those

598
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:45,169
things no matter which field they're

599
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:46,760
going into so professional ujin's so you

600
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,049
know employers are sitting there trying

601
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,230
to figure out how to fill this gap

602
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,629
they're trying to find a needle in the

603
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,740
haystack that they're looking for to you

604
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,600
know do different things in their

605
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,340
cybersecurity infrastructure what should

606
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:05,899
they be thinking about before they start

607
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:07,668
writing JavaScript so that's a good

608
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:09,768
question so what should they be thinking

609
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:10,429
about before they start writing the Job

610
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,429
Description

611
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,809
I guess their end goals like any time

612
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,070
you're ready jobs you know anytime

613
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:19,399
you're looking for somebody what are

614
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:21,408
your goals and so is your goal to find

615
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,029
somebody who's already fully cooked or

616
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:25,880
are you willing to put the time and

617
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:28,450
effort into training those people so I

618
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,669
think a lot of times businesses look at

619
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,039
educational institutions as being the

620
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,559
sole provider of the training that

621
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,129
students are that their employees are

622
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,649
going to need so they try to push their

623
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,779
training responsibilities down to an

624
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,039
educational level like if as long as I

625
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,179
get somebody with this degree they're

626
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,120
gonna have all the training that they

627
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,519
need and that's just not the case and so

628
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,399
you're gonna need to put the time in so

629
00:25:52,519 --> 00:26:00,139
what are the things that you can't train

630
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:03,139
yourself that you need people to have so

631
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:07,309
I would I would say first look at

632
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:09,799
personality characteristics and you know

633
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:13,940
interests and things like that and then

634
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:17,889
secondarily you look at the actual skill

635
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,889
things that you can teach them later on

636
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,030
person on that so how do we search that

637
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,030
you for our question and then James you

638
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,190
can also chime in as well so how do we

639
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,950
attract people from different career

640
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,600
fields to cyber security how do we help

641
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,130
them bridge the gap I'm thinking like

642
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,419
some of those English major right you

643
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,210
know they're there in cyber security

644
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:41,370
watch live shows they realize that being

645
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,110
English major may not have most

646
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:50,399
lucrative job opportunities attached to

647
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:51,990
it you know they're looking to

648
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,670
transition to cybersecurity what are the

649
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,830
ways they can do that and how to attract

650
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,330
more people from these different

651
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,429
backgrounds and not just English majors

652
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,560
or people who didn't go to college not

653
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,390
the traditional households differing

654
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:08,909
backgrounds how do we attract different

655
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:12,540
people to this field not just like

656
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:15,750
attracting anything or attracting people

657
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,070
to any any discipline you need to find

658
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,270
people where they're at and speak to

659
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:21,210
them in the language that they're

660
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,790
familiar so for if I were trying to

661
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,550
reach out to English and Philosophy or

662
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,770
writing intensive majors I would say

663
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,860
that it's good if we can catch these

664
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,600
people it's better if we can communicate

665
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,280
how we caught this particular person and

666
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,110
the methods that we use to catch this

667
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,210
particular person with this we can

668
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,639
identify this particular intrusion in

669
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,160
this breach and communicated that in

670
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,200
language that people can understand both

671
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,990
to replicate our success with other

672
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,030
businesses could protect themselves also

673
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,890
how we can better relate that to the

674
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,720
media and put it put these breaches in

675
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,090
terms that people can understand talking

676
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,770
about millions of people when you're

677
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,110
looking at the loss of maybe social

678
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,550
security numbers and the number is so

679
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,260
big and you think to yourself I don't

680
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,899
really understand how that could pertain

681
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,690
to me you talk about things like Social

682
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,520
Security numbers in terms of being used

683
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,740
to for instance a lot of credit cards

684
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,310
and how you couldn't have your personal

685
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:21,600
identity personality identifiable

686
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:22,889
information stolen or borrowed to open

687
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,750
up lines for credit for example that

688
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,340
people start to see how that relates

689
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,099
more immediately

690
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,779
for the Lord math and science oriented

691
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:36,570
folks I think they can already see how

692
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:39,029
how our requirements would dovetail I

693
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,879
think where we the area that we're

694
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:45,059
losing the most in our more of the the

695
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:49,289
creators I think we lose a lot from art

696
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:50,609
I think we lose a lot from people in

697
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:52,619
computer science that sort of have the

698
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:55,019
spark and they think that security is

699
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:59,279
sort of a dead end for people that don't

700
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:01,769
have a need for intuition or being able

701
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,570
to take that that leap of faith into the

702
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:05,489
trying something new when in fact those

703
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,718
are the exact people I would say that we

704
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:08,609
need the most especially in the

705
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:10,859
researching we need people that are

706
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:14,460
looking at things outside of the box

707
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,168
like we how can we how can we break into

708
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,029
an air-gapped machine how can we

709
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:23,159
introduce Stuxnet introduce a virus into

710
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:25,889
an Iranian nuclear facility without

711
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,690
being able to approach that particular

712
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:30,089
facility from the internet we have to

713
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,639
develop say a sub operating system-level

714
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,899
throw another particular device and see

715
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,330
what happens if we can get some of the

716
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,008
walk-in and connected to the network not

717
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,960
something a very straight forward person

718
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,279
who's used to begin just by anyway to

719
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,629
keyboard until we find the solution

720
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:48,479
approach we need to speak to that need

721
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:50,099
for creativity and it's going back to my

722
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:52,529
philosophy background sayeth there's a

723
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,629
guy Bronowski who wrote collection of

724
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:58,589
essays other science of human

725
00:29:54,629 --> 00:30:01,439
understanding and they're very short but

726
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:04,049
they articulate how much science relies

727
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,299
on creativity and if we can sort of

728
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:08,249
refocus that in the minds of our

729
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:11,700
students I think we have a better chance

730
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:14,219
of catching and I would also say that a

731
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,460
lot of the problems that secondary

732
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:21,139
education faces are our problems that

733
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,700
are caused by our lack of willingness to

734
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:26,459
sort of involve ourselves in the

735
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:30,659
students before they get to us we should

736
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,080
be and I just applaud Excelsior we would

737
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:36,370
just we just hosted a great

738
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,168
cyber camp where we taught 30 area high

739
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,449
school school teachers about how to

740
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,919
teach their students about the

741
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,840
principles of cybersecurity things like

742
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,549
strengthen password don't share your

743
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,168
house but we talk to them we talk to

744
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:49,090
them in terms of you wouldn't give your

745
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:50,470
locker combination to somebody who's a

746
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,059
friend today because they might not be a

747
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:56,080
friend tomorrow and they might do

748
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,549
something to your locker I you try to

749
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,559
speak to them where they're at

750
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,899
that's it's not an easy thing to do it

751
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,830
especially in academia you know when we

752
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:04,809
use big words like

753
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,918
antidisestablishmentarianism people fall

754
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,590
asleep before I get to the end of the

755
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,360
word but if we use smaller words again

756
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,490
using if we could make up example some

757
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,899
for tonight for example I know I could

758
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,820
reach little sports with high schoolers

759
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:17,649
immediately if we talk about social

760
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,689
media to talk about snaps or Instagram

761
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:28,090
or applications that the kids are using

762
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:30,370
today the kids we can we can at least to

763
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,049
show them that there is their interest

764
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,539
in technology well not directly

765
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:36,668
applicable now if they're able to sort

766
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:39,279
of appreciate technology and understand

767
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:40,870
that the creativity that the

768
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,750
stick-to-itiveness that they're there

769
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:46,120
they display the playing video games

770
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:51,940
that that can manifest later on with a

771
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:56,649
little cultivation so yeah so I think I

772
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:58,299
think like like coding has has got a

773
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:02,379
long way to attract those kinds of

774
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:05,649
people in terms of like different lower

775
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,899
end user products like scratch and all

776
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:10,029
the hour of code products that are

777
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:13,000
designed not for people who really know

778
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:15,730
how to code but for people who can who

779
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,370
need to learn how to think do kind of

780
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,320
computer thinking and so I think that

781
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,549
cyber probably needs something like that

782
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,029
and then the other thing I'm thinking

783
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:28,090
about is as a as a person in secondary

784
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:29,860
education if somebody like Ethan so that

785
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,870
they want a department with my school I

786
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,449
would immediately want to partner

787
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:38,139
the computer science class but like

788
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:40,150
knowing what he just said it's it's

789
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,090
actually a great idea to partner in with

790
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,279
a non traditional non-traditional

791
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:48,158
pathways to partnering with in our class

792
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,919
or some other kind of class so maybe in

793
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,450
forging those relationships make sure to

794
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:55,120
specifically tell people that it's not

795
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,370
just the kids and nobodies that you're

796
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,408
looking for but it's all all the kids in

797
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,658
the school because it isn't the hoodies

798
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:03,669
tend to be pretty like exclusionary they

799
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:05,919
tend to want to be like an isolated Club

800
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:08,620
and not let other people into their club

801
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,690
and so letting other people know that

802
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,949
they're welcome to I think is a good

803
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:20,080
idea me that's a great point so I think

804
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:22,000
you know right now it is 35 past so one

805
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,678
open up the audience has any questions

806
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,620
here I think the last panel for the day

807
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,149
so but we want to get to take the

808
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,889
audience terms of what questions you

809
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:31,928
guys have about work for some what's

810
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,860
going on things that people may want to

811
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,380
think about getting into this industry

812
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:39,510
or anything else that you prefer this

813
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,510
panel yes in the back

814
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,239
[Music]

815
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:58,200
future and have rejected all of that

816
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,000
sure I can speak to that so the question

817
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,890
was what's the research look like terms

818
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,810
of the gap what is it moving over to

819
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,540
solving it where are the things that are

820
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,679
out there right now and what does the

821
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,600
research tell us in terms of direction

822
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,179
Gretchen's not good so that's the

823
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,500
researchers hi so anything you didn't

824
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,580
give you an extrapolation today's

825
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,590
numbers you're going to get rid of

826
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,989
things right so you know hey if we keep

827
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,190
going down a certain path well if I

828
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:22,560
can't control like this mentioned hit

829
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:25,830
the moon no I can't stop it at the

830
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,600
moment because the market forces will

831
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,429
eventually kick in and start providing

832
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,460
different solutions but right now we are

833
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:37,620
on track to be tooling job shoppers 2021

834
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:39,060
it's a situation in you that's that is

835
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,918
worldwide in the u.s. right now we're

836
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,219
seven or twenty thousand jobs shot where

837
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:50,279
we need to be and as current protections

838
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:52,020
fertilise life that's for mr. okay yes

839
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,940
you can so for those who want to learn

840
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,899
more about the current job shortage in

841
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,030
your area it was actually a great

842
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:00,089
website called cyber seek cyber seek

843
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:03,270
operates in with a couple different

844
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:06,060
parties miss points to it and basically

845
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,670
the Cypress each website shows your heat

846
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,529
map showing you fill the jobs in your

847
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,750
area not just to show you the jobs with

848
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,720
a volume of jobs in your area and then

849
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,860
what is the protected gap there and

850
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,230
that's where a lot of the information

851
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:24,540
terms of today's data come from so so

852
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,020
also another thing that would be

853
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,190
probably a positive step would be to

854
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,020
have an event that's sort of like this

855
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,600
but with counselors because counselors

856
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,780
are always looking for other avenues

857
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,850
show their kids and so to even have a

858
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,040
room like this or show that he map to

859
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,960
counselors would be a really positive

860
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,180
step well the other thing too is that

861
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,340
you know market forces they play a role

862
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,899
as we talked about the beginning average

863
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,320
salary in DC for exceptional

864
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,060
professional $116,000 that's that's

865
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,090
going to draw people in over time I

866
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,320
think there's a challenge though is that

867
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,970
it's not a feel that people feel call

868
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,800
getting into which is why we do need

869
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,959
more people to have conversations about

870
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,170
how to get different folks into this

871
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,120
industry we also need to broaden so only

872
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,700
9 percent of cursory professionals are

873
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,560
you know you know if you look at the

874
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,109
general population that's a symptomatic

875
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,000
math workout if you want to take it take

876
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,000
a traffic from the accounting industry

877
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,190
so in 1950 there were only 800 certified

878
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,780
professional council women the

879
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,610
accounting industry said listen listen

880
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,350
real close real issue we really want to

881
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,500
get women to this field to feel that we

882
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,390
know that has needs and growth and we

883
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,740
need to fulfill that and they did a

884
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,270
large amount of efforts to try to

885
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,100
attract more women to consider this as a

886
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,360
career path and it was very successful I

887
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,220
don't think we're still we're not a

888
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,630
charity but we have gone a long way

889
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,850
because 200,000 sort of CPAs that are

890
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,640
female in the United States right now so

891
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,350
it's a matter of identifying where we

892
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,690
can bring in people who are currently

893
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,460
not part of this conversation as Ethan

894
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,230
said early to buy English majors and as

895
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,550
Jim said about you know paying well

896
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,570
national computer science program

897
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,070
remember should not go to the history

898
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,320
program if we should match them up with

899
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,340
the arts program or maybe the criminal

900
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,590
justice program

901
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,750
so as we broaden that view of who can be

902
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,130
participating it's going to open up new

903
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,350
doors the last thing I'll leave you guys

904
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,650
with to is on this topic although we're

905
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,610
happy to have questions is that when the

906
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,460
fastest-growing

907
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:23,010
female then c-suite titles is the chief

908
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,380
privacy officer because this is an area

909
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,270
that is touching on cybersecurity that's

910
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,720
such a good idea but also has its roots

911
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,550
in legislation law policy and people are

912
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,930
gravitating to towards that so there are

913
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,900
ways that we can reach out to different

914
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,609
audiences and say

915
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,010
and this is it here you're doing one

916
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:40,569
thing that's a privacy there are no

917
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,039
alignments of privacy with cybersecurity

918
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:43,779
perhaps you're interested in a career

919
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:48,160
change and that might draw the folks in

920
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:50,349
as well just wanted to give a plug to

921
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,170
for Career and Technical Education in

922
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:55,270
high school so so Career and Technical

923
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,339
Education our goal prose or vocational

924
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:01,450
high schools have really come a long way

925
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:03,308
in the last couple of decades and so I

926
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:06,098
know that at Capital Region BOCES is

927
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:09,460
currently doing a lot to try to develop

928
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:13,660
programming that that meets this needs

929
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:17,440
specifically but meeting with local

930
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,509
BOCES and other organizations to talk to

931
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,260
about the need but they're designed so

932
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:26,890
that they can address workforce needs so

933
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:29,589
they they do that all the time and when

934
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,118
markets go up and down they change their

935
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:33,009
programs and so you'd be really

936
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,140
surprised at the programs that you'd

937
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,480
find in a vocational high school right

938
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,819
now so it's not just like carpentry and

939
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,569
electrical trades anymore all kinds of

940
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:58,660
stuff yeah other questions from the

941
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:59,799
audience so I review the question just

942
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,240
because we're recording and then we'll

943
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:03,640
pick it up so how realistic is that that

944
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,589
we'll see the funding through for K

945
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,250
through 12 education efforts on

946
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:12,480
cybersecurity I can speak directly to

947
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:15,760
that the gen cyber program initiated

948
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,420
through a joint effort by the NSF and

949
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,230
the DoD in addition to NSA support its

950
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,650
setting up a number of grants last year

951
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:28,690
or this past year that 156 grants

952
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:30,190
earning on average about ninety thousand

953
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,890
five hundred thousand dollars each in an

954
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,079
effort to either teach middle and high

955
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,390
school teachers or to reach out to K

956
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,850
through 12 students directly at some

957
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,310
camps

958
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,270
in South Dakota California they've

959
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,930
already progressed to the point where

960
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,310
again they have sleepaway camp where

961
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:49,009
2040 a hundred students are able to go

962
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:52,970
and work on sort of intro level coding

963
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:55,460
skills were cybersecurity skills that

964
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,189
those those efforts are underway and

965
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,460
through this we're also looking at

966
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,450
looking at the the CIA triad

967
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,580
confidentiality and accessibility

968
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,830
I mean integrity isness of serving the

969
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,140
three pillars they also have identified

970
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:11,060
sort of ten guidelines that we want to

971
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,220
teach students about it's part

972
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,400
mentalization and modulation and how all

973
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:18,319
these these concepts are important it

974
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,910
really is sort of a top-down effort to

975
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,820
try to codify these things first before

976
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,560
we just tell them go ahead go ahead and

977
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,970
preach the gospel of cybersecurity but

978
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,070
everyone's speaking in a different

979
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,080
language no two of these sort of

980
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:33,110
cybersecurity cults meet or speak to the

981
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,810
same principles so they're really they

982
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,540
are trying to do that first and then

983
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,529
push the way also this is really this

984
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,200
came up fast

985
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,420
I really you didn't there were hints

986
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,990
that cyber security what's going to be

987
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:50,900
important in the late 90s 2000 but even

988
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,700
the most pressing people didn't see the

989
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,180
need for as many of these these

990
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:59,080
professionals until we got to sort of

991
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:01,009
the post 9/11 era working on towards

992
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,140
2007-2008

993
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:06,710
so really it's it's we're playing it

994
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,940
with ketchup right now other other

995
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,720
people that were out there they were

996
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,370
popularized in the media I mean I'm

997
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,859
sorry ahead of time for those of you

998
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,450
that see the movie hackers but movies

999
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,160
like that or wargames really sort of

1000
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:23,359
popularized the idea that the security

1001
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,310
was so lacks it was sort of an

1002
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,840
afterthought to these systems that if

1003
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,799
you had a if you had a password you were

1004
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,610
safe or if you had

1005
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,860
that backdoors existed into systems

1006
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:40,370
because coders are lazy I can attest

1007
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:43,800
that we didn't take the sort of popular

1008
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:45,330
influence and and parlay that into

1009
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,210
something useful and right now we're

1010
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:50,190
getting to that and I'm gonna talk about

1011
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,420
how CIS does sponsor some stuff like

1012
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,080
this as well tear Weaver on the side

1013
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,070
challenge which is a challenge for

1014
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,840
people get asked questions cyber

1015
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:59,660
security and that rolls up two camps

1016
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,040
that are occurring across the country

1017
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,720
and then if you can op there something's

1018
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,220
associated with it and we have the wrong

1019
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,020
you know researchers out there too that

1020
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,779
we help provide obviously participate

1021
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,920
but with James of universe high school

1022
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,770
as well working a lot of other

1023
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,120
universities they see all the

1024
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:44,820
universities help broaden it so and we

1025
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:46,170
are severely funded so the question for

1026
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,570
the brain is that you know there are a

1027
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,950
lot of these coding camps that teach you

1028
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,570
a lot of those applications but there's

1029
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,160
not as much of the camps for

1030
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:57,060
cybersecurity like how do you pen test

1031
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,230
to break things down even though James I

1032
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:03,270
get your take on that one but I think

1033
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:04,470
you know I think it's interesting you

1034
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,930
know kids come through and when I take

1035
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,580
down election based websites so I think

1036
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,290
you're starting to see and you know

1037
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,730
Tyler Duluth organizes event to his

1038
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,279
credit has invited a lot of high school

1039
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,410
is this being very open to people to

1040
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,610
come out to this conference I think

1041
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,140
you're starting to see people do more of

1042
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,180
that but you're right there is not

1043
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,560
enough we have a few camps ourselves yes

1044
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,720
problems or do other programs that are

1045
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,950
like that there is some in other

1046
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,950
initiatives that are coming down the

1047
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:31,859
pike that are going to be broader

1048
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:34,169
states are sponsoring some larger camps

1049
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,580
and programs but you're right what kind

1050
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,590
of

1051
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,830
they catch on the cybersecurity issue I

1052
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:41,450
think stem has been a longtime focus for

1053
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,980
where we need to put people that coding

1054
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,870
is a really good example of staff you

1055
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,130
know if you understand annakodi you're

1056
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,160
going to translate a lot of the things

1057
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:51,470
within that stem sector cybersecurity is

1058
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,960
a bit more specialized discipline to

1059
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,879
some extent and so therefore I think

1060
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,940
there's also Jeff and misses on it but

1061
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,450
that's changing I would also say that

1062
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,740
it's sort of a pedagogical issue

1063
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,029
teaching programming you're coming the

1064
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,430
least in the very beginning you're

1065
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,600
coming from here's a here's an outcome

1066
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,950
we're trying to reach these are the

1067
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,720
steps that you take in the language that

1068
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:15,200
you use to describe and achieve that

1069
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,970
outcome cybersecurity there is some

1070
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,799
level of a background knowledge that you

1071
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,629
need in order to make this to make this

1072
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
work you need to know the program but if

1073
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,050
I say okay stop

1074
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,940
show me how you brush your teeth your

1075
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,440
algorithms question team showed me how

1076
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,050
to stuff how you would stop somebody

1077
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,840
brushing your teeth from another room

1078
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:35,240
using Intel using some sort of device or

1079
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,680
other other methods you would need to be

1080
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,990
able to for instance look at a network

1081
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,859
understand how how networking works or

1082
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:44,200
how wireless communication works or how

1083
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,790
operating systems work in general

1084
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,040
specific but broad strokes how these

1085
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,600
things happen and then your sort of

1086
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,720
scaffolding that information whereas

1087
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:56,150
beginning programming much easier design

1088
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,009
- you're starting it you're starting

1089
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:01,520
with the concept and executing from

1090
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,990
start to finish how that happens away so

1091
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,400
we're making steps of that direction

1092
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,370
with a lot of very smart people working

1093
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,320
on it but again before we can't just sit

1094
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:11,359
somebody down and say okay you're

1095
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,650
cybersecurity or a large here are tools

1096
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,300
that we use to log on the network

1097
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,590
traffic here's what network traffic is

1098
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,780
here's what indefinite does here's

1099
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,340
weather here's what's going over our

1100
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,210
network and here's here's how we

1101
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:25,400
basically have to work backwards to come

1102
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,840
up with a lesson plan and then cram all

1103
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,020
that in to get to the interesting cool

1104
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,100
stuff that's I would say that's part of

1105
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,050
the problem

1106
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,870
but the effort is the effort is in place

1107
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:39,150
to try to do that and we can start kids

1108
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,279
very from a very being able to do this

1109
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,020
we saw this back in early 2000 with

1110
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,850
raspberry PI's when they were first

1111
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,520
introduced along they were used first

1112
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:51,540
it's like a platform Python but now that

1113
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,590
they're even then they were so cheap you

1114
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,140
can network them together you could

1115
00:45:52,590 --> 00:46:00,450
simulate several computers on the

1116
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:03,440
network and you can try to attack before

1117
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,439
I'm able to follow

1118
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,039
[Music]

1119
00:46:32,060 --> 00:47:33,540
all right welcome to imposter syndrome

1120
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:35,549
everyone everyone starting out or making

1121
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:38,369
a career change is going to feel the

1122
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:40,170
same way now again reaching for the

1123
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:42,930
stars and banking all of your hopes on

1124
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,490
one particular job I want that job as

1125
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:48,149
the director of networks at Google with

1126
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:50,910
a two-degree know your own has to be

1127
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:53,390
actual of them but you can reach for

1128
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,950
something more local or you can say I'm

1129
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,940
at a particular place I need maybe a

1130
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,730
little bit more and then you can also

1131
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:04,700
either continue on to 40 degree or

1132
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:07,740
looking certificates to supplement like

1133
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:11,700
assisting so there's different ten

1134
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,390
significant services is ta I'm taking

1135
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,069
the SANS

1136
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,200
certifications myself one of the things

1137
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,760
there's new grants and I kinda like this

1138
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,470
really unique but it's an open book test

1139
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,279
and there's a part of the motor

1140
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:24,038
certification

1141
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:25,989
but the reason why so a book is that in

1142
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:28,329
the real world you can go find answers

1143
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:29,349
you know it's not like you're sitting in

1144
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:31,809
fight or something you can't go to

1145
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:34,359
Google you can't you can find answers so

1146
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:36,640
the challenge of feeling like how we can

1147
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:38,109
start with us where I go you know just

1148
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,089
doing what you're doing which is that is

1149
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:41,859
for those record you know stun to your

1150
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:44,049
college stem to try to get into the

1151
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,910
