morning everyone welcome to any con year

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,530
to get this thing kicked off here so

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,959
decided to cut the the kick off a little

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,000
bit short this year keep it short sweet

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:19,280
it's probably gonna be almost a

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,060
duplicate last year

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,210
ultimately I just want to thank everyone

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,660
gonna call her keynotes

48
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,760
last year our keynote speaker Dave

49
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,859
Kennedy who was here for that anyone

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,030
remember Dave alright so it turns out

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,950
Dave is a giant jerk and he will refuse

52
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,989
to let us pay for his an affair like

53
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,250
just downright refuses like throw it

54
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,650
towards next year's conference well

55
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,380
joke's on you day before we did was we

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,269
took that money and we put somebody

57
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,359
through a single mother through Albany

58
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,100
King Cohn who is also a sponsor here who

59
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,319
does this very very cool couple month

60
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,140
boot camp to teach people web

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,609
programming languages run any back-end

62
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,970
so it's really cool and something that

63
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,600
we hope to continue to do as we as we

64
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,680
build any comments more charity efforts

65
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,329
especially that you know if we can get

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,519
more people involved in the community

67
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,860
technology and good career options we

68
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,480
are very happy to do that

69
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,069
so if you ever see Dave or you want to

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,810
tweet to him just thank him for his

71
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:07,310
continuous supportive community and we

72
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,780
showed up here for free flying in from

73
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:15,079
God knows where at that time so again

74
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:18,739
why Eddie Khan ultimately our goals here

75
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:20,810
are to grow and build and solidify the

76
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,079
cyber security cyber security and

77
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,549
hacking community in the northeast so

78
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,750
the cool thing is that again this is

79
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,640
only our second year I feel like we have

80
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,680
such a great solid community that's

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,119
already here and it's just a matter of

82
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,090
bringing attention to that wearing this

83
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,130
to it and continually growing and so

84
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,780
honestly you guys everyone that shows up

85
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,130
is such a huge part of that we wouldn't

86
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,200
be here if a lot before and for all you

87
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,690

89
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,140
community and on that note we've got a

90
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,720
lot of cool like really tiny noobs

91
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,040
joining us this year we've got some kids

92
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,569
from Tech Valley High School who have

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,970

94
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,078
definitely check them now it's really

95
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,970

showing interest in what we're doing and

98
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,420
I believe we got a couple kids even

99
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,769
smaller than high school age joining us

100

Jen the ones that were on the hardware

107
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,210

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,080

109
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,489

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,690
programming teensy devices and some

114
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:49,289
other cool board type projects what are

115
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,510

check that out also we bomb in that area

122

will have fourth family which is very

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,460
very cool enough for profit in the area

124
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,650
who teaches underserved youth I get some

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,239
involved with stem through the use of

126
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,310
like sports medicine they're doing some

127
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,250
very very cool stuff so check them out

128
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:25,320
as well the CTF so my my team built the

129
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,630
CTF again this year we tried to make it

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,919
a little bit more accessible not go so

131
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,130
crazy this year I think you guys will

132
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,200
see it's a more accessible board and

133
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,110
challenge than all that so if you get a

134
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,820
chance there's going to be more more

135
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,280
prizes this year for the winners of the

136
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,590
CTF it's a ton of fun good way to test

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,719
your skills everything from networking

138
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,539
web crypto forensics all that so

139
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,400
definitely check it out we can do we

140
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,070
have the the ping-pong tournament again

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,090
this year so last year we gave a black

142
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,110
badge to the winner of that I don't

143
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,280
think I've seen that yet so we'll

144
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,150
probably do that again we'll do a black

145
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,500
badge for the one of the ping pong

146
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,969
tournaments make sure that you uh you

147
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,930
sign up at the registration desk if you

148
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,640
haven't already or you can sign up

149
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:11,250
online one of the things that I hope we

150
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,159
can start to pour Nate this year is and

151
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,169
we just frankly ran out of time is if

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,639
you look above you there's a very very

153
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:22,810
cool ceiling built with

154
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,590
a giant array of LEDs and this year we

155
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,750
were given permission to play with that

156
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,508
so yeah so that's what you can do with a

157
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,360
giant array of LEDs we've got some cool

158
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,550
ideas I think what we're gonna do this

159
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,050
year because we ran out of time it just

160
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,759
kind of coordinate and come up with a

161
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,449
strategy for how we can interface with

162
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,280
that and do some different things so

163
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,969
we'll tell more about that hopefully you

164
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,619
can expect to see that that next year

165
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:52,270
wireless internet is free just like it

166
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,979
was last year ECC guess there's no

167
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,279
there's no credentials just hop on use

168
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,539
the Internet one one small point so

169
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,550
again this is still year two we're still

170
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:05,050
working through some kinks I was trying

171
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,449
to think of an analogy for how chaotic

172
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,090
it is organizing an event like this and

173
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know what it says about it but

174
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,008
when the analogy is as bad as the

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,229
reality all I can think of is it's like

176
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,330
it's a bunch of you know hackers trying

177
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,000
to organize a big event it's like that's

178
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,889
how bad it is so bear with us there's

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,779
still gonna be some headaches we've got

180
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,029
a couple small changes one of them is

181
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,580
that downstairs you'll see that the

182
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:33,219
program reverses the order of the rooms

183
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,198
so it's actually offense/defense

184
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,300
education they have signs out in front

185
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,789
of the doors so you should be good

186
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,639
a couple of the talks are being swapped

187
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:44,740
or moved around the CIS panel is

188
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,900
actually the first talk after Deb's

189
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,939
keynote in the educationally today and

190
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,460
the talk to there is moving to their

191
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,689
Saturday slot so if you look at that in

192
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,430
your program I definitely recommend

193
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,439
checking out the CSS panel that's seems

194
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,659
like it's gonna be very cool so other

195
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,800
than that bear with us and there is a

196
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,860
feedback form and we'll have on the

197
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,000
website at any time you can you know

198
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,949
come track us down and give us feedback

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,960
in person otherwise feel free to just

200
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,520
post up the on line and let us know we

201
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,580
want your feedback we want to make this

202
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,299
conference as good as it can be so we

203
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,628
want to know what your thoughts so this

204
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,330
year based on that

205
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,449
some of the changes that we made from

206
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,248
last year based on everyone's feedback

207
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:28,860
swag bags so this year we've got got

208
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:30,929
swag through on that side though we've

209
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,219
shortened the talks to 50 minutes and so

210
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:34,259
we Freda don't like a 10 minute buffer

211
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,250
in between talks so just be aware of

212
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,079
that that you should have a little bit

213
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,990
of time to you know end your talks and

214
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:42,388
go check out the next one lunch this

215
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,670
year is included so it'll be served

216
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,069
right up here and we've given an hour

217
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,089
and a half for lunch so if you're not

218
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,529
familiar with Albany

219
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,970
I recommend grabbing your lunch and

220
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,500
checking it out outside there's some

221
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,029
beautiful spots you can take the lunch

222
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,519
right at the capital or walking to the

223
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,630
plaza both of those are two minute walk

224
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,940
otherwise with that hour and a half you

225
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,959
know mingle meet people check out the

226
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,759
seats yeah for the hardware hacking

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,979
village but we tried to make it you know

228
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,649
much more accessible and easier to to

229
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,019
navigate this year there will be a cash

230
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,880
bar as well with lunch so if any of you

231
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,759

232
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,589

235
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,029
it easier on everybody and there's an

236
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,579
unofficial gathering at the end of today

237
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,079
and tomorrow after the conference at

238
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,279
City beer hall which is right down this

239
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,550
this hill right here

240
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,600
I think that's Howard Street so you know

241
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,040
we're just going to show up there kind

242
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,079
of trickle in as needed but if you guys

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,430
want to you know continue the party

244
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:42,540
afterwards and meet some more people

245
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:45,180
then join us there the only other thing

246
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,389
is that you know we plan on doing any

247
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,739
con next year what we hope to do we got

248
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,720
some tentative time slots with the

249
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,959
capital centers move it into September

250
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,490
so maybe somewhere around mid-september

251
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,529
all of those slots were taken this year

252
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,779
so you know we we have to take August

253
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,279
but I hope that will help inspire some

254
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:06,000
of the kids in school and all that to

255
