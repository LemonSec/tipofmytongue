1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
good together so this this is awesome

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,060
because this is totally why I love to do

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,529
policy talks and it's going to be a

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,050
little bit of an interesting policy talk

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,670
to and this is what I expect for pretty

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,920
much an interesting policy talk it's

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,850
like half the room is Depot I know and

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,630
the other two people I know that so what

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,640
we're going to be talking about the

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,189
names social media security policies and

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,230
it sounds really boring and what's

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,448
mostly annoying about this whole thing

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,119
is I come from the really technical side

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,130
of security and I just by quote kind of

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,050
found my way into the sea so each side

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,510
of security

17
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,949
recently MIT so exciti mostly focusing

18
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,899
today I'm really interesting like

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,059
lawsuits actually tore this gonna

20
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,829
reminisce or now that sounds a little

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,629
bit weird but what we're going to find

22
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,610
out is that social media security

23
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,559
particularly the policy area is actually

24
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,629
the most litigious area of security

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,789
policy I've ever seen and I might not

26
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,140
tell that interesting but the lawsuits

27
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,030
that we'll be looking at are kind of

28
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,550
cool and kind of interesting because

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,559
they essentially say what can we talk

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,210
about social media as employees and who

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,310
regulates that we'll be talking about it

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,320
more as we go forward so before we go

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,299
too far never mind Who am I and why am i

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,389
speaking up here it's always the

35
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,340
question I next time Sanders that's not

36
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,780
typically perhaps a chain but if you

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,729
feel the urge by all means go ahead

38
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,000
I currently work at a company called

39
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,890
zero Fox they do social medias Theresa I

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,780
don't necessarily do them for them at

41
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,060
work on the product I work internally on

42
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,810
the internal security side however as

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,970
we'll see

44
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,350
that's going to be important for us in

45
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,490
terms of social media security as a

46
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,649
whole because obviously social we use

47
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,990
be curious about social media security

48
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:43,270
hope you would hope although it turns

49
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,009
out that most contractors don't tend to

50
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,500
care about contractors security but

51
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,700
that's different conversation altogether

52
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
in addition to that I have a couple side

53
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,930
needs that lecture up in Rochester so

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,679
yeah upstate New York even though other

55
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,270
than Baltimore additionally I donate a

56
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,670
lot of my time to the I lost project so

57
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,798
that's pretty exciting for me as well so

58
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,110
but they expect policy talk that covers

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,119
law any type of regard to keep it to

60
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,590
account that I not a lawyer as much as I

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,929
would like to be as much as I watched

62
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,489
crack kind of Law & Order SVU and as

63
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,650
much as I stated the to get in last

64
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,000
night or whatever it is I still am NOT

65
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,489
going to be a lawyer I'm not going to go

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,100
back to school for that long but the

67
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,450
good thing here is that that I have a

68
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,030
lot of vested interest in social media

69
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,350
security and so I have a lot of time to

70
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,220
go through this and figure out what the

71
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,750
actual ramifications are so what is

72
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,250
social media security before we can

73
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,420
answer this whole like policy question

74
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,860
we will need to understand what I'm

75
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,170
talking about here there's some obvious

76
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,090
things that we can take into account

77
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,160
Facebook is social media alright

78
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,510
everybody here agrees probably everybody

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,120
here has Facebook we'll talk about that

80
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,160
a goal second see plankton yeah I think

81
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,660
we all see them as social media but when

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,579
we start getting into some or emulous

83
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,709
areas that the policy that you're going

84
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:55,630
to be writing or applying still probably

85
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,010
applies to we start talking about things

86
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,980
like reddit right there's a social

87
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,720
construction what about blog posts where

88
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,518
you're actually commenting on things do

89
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,980
those apply this new social media policy

90
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,510
my chances are high that it does in the

91
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,950
ramifications that are going to apply

92
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,660
the disciplinary actions there you go

93
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,450
take the effects that you're gonna want

94
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,069
to restrict so when we start talking

95
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,319
about social media policies people get

96
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,000
concerned if there's like Facebook yeah

97
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,530
Facebook is cool but we're also talking

98
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,220
to a whole suite of other things that

99
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,720
isn't just Facebook Matt when we talk

100
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,569
about Facebook though we need to realize

101
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,910
why we actually care about this so I

102
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:33,850
like to give some perspective you there

103
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,459
are six million people or photos for

104
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,870
people

105
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,700
right there's about seven million people

106
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,540
right now in the world so whole slope

107
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,890
you know six out of seven have phones

108
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,900
4.5 out of those people for my five

109
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:50,119
billion have toilets almost obviously

110
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,560
people who employ lives have email and I

111
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,560
guess we all do our grandparents who

112
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,480
don't have email okay and then you got

113
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,159
oh they put this in perspective like

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,649
half the people who have toilets on the

115
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,010
planet have Facebook like that's insane

116
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,840
right that's a large attack surface so

117
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,060
this is why we care when we think about

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,069
phishing you look at large attack

119
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,510
services and how likely an attacker is

120
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,069
to try and leverage them because they

121
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,858
know that you have it where the threat

122
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,988
vector actually sits emails pretty

123
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,120
obvious and we've all seen a prep time

124
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,349
fishing on you know right and by the way

125
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,970
if you're concerned about cursing I

126
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:27,440
apologize I won't stop but I apologize

127
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,770
so we've seen a lot of vision feed you

128
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,259
know so Facebook also has this really

129
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,960
clear obvious advantage that people can

130
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:37,610
target it and that's really nice now the

131
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,219
interesting thing to consider is the

132
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,620
rest of this target graph we start

133
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,150
talking about other tools right Google

134
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,039
Maps and things like that hundreds of

135
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,239
millions of people use them we start

136
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,190
talking about the size of the largest

137
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,680
employer of planet Earth that's the ODA

138
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,510
3.2 million people that has a large

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,070
attack surface they can be targeted and

140
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,680
let me talk about what you guys are

141
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,000
spending your money today right how do

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,620
you need to fix that a really cool

143
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,840
sequel injection vulnerability that's in

144
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,570
your application and how much money

145
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,250
anything towards that meanwhile how much

146
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,560
money are you putting towards solving

147
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,159
the attacks on email Facebook or I guess

148
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,320
in this particular context toilets but

149
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,370
the idea here is pretty simple if you're

150
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,020
spending you know 40% of your budget on

151
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,699
just internal tools that are only seen

152
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,219
by hundred people and maybe you should

153
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,050
consider the extra room

154
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,330
what your threats look like and where

155
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,770
they're going to be targeting that being

156
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,930
said there's also something to be said

157
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,820
about social media work now who here is

158
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,740
actually guilty of this using social

159
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,780
media during the day at work because

160
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,610
it's awesome Jake raise your hand talk

161
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:46,030
to you while you're at work I'm at work

162
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,430
I'm on social media three so this turns

163
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,739
out to be about 67% of employees admit

164
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,540
admit I think this is low but admit to

165
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,800
regularly checking social media while at

166
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,630
work and I'm definitely one of those

167
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,940
people which is a fantastic adventure

168
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,469
for everybody involved now that's a

169
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,969
problem for you as a security person

170
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,740
because that's why we're here the

171
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,450
problem is that this is our traditional

172
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,130
perimeter security now we can all say

173
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,659
like beyond corporate so we're going to

174
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,159
face and there's no perimeter anymore

175
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,420
and we're all great but all of you

176
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,680
pretty much have the Enzi's at this

177
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,980
point still so I'm not gonna like

178
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,450
acknowledge that fact so we have

179
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,520
defenses and we've built up this whole

180
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,289
environment about what to do on our

181
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,599
perimeter from an internal box to an

182
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,820
external space we have things like wax

183
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,770
you have SAS tools honey pods we've

184
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,690
heard literally less talk at top stop

185
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,820
you have about 16 different things that

186
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,219
people are doing it was fantastic and

187
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,169
that's amazing when you're controlling

188
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,330
the tool but as we move more and more

189
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,979
into a modern architecture we end up

190
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,229
with something that looks like this I

191
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,210
can't control the security tools that

192
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,909
are put in place in addition so all I

193
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:49,000
can do is I can control policy and then

194
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,460
I can control three sports right like

195
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,250
don't click on this and like back

196
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,570
off if maybe right like maybe I'll be

197
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,729
able to control that but essentially I

198
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,070
had the will of whatever platform is

199
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,990
providing that service so we can start

200
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,120
talking about like crazy things like the

201
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,350
fact that Facebook or even WordPress

202
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,940
like don't need the engine you don't

203
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,180
support Santa so the whole

204
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,759
authentication system

205
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,350
my internal system that's just not going

206
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,090
to work in fact when we started talking

207
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,639
about some social networks they don't

208
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,469
even support sharing the account so I

209
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,940
believe that Facebook pages is this way

210
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,500
but don't hold me to that certainly one

211
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,000
of the social networks is very don't

212
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,100
look like this it can only be linked

213
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,960
with one user and so when you start

214
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,340
dealing with off-boarding and onboarding

215
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,840
users you're like hey can you log into

216
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,060
your personal email and transfer that

217
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,758
like company asset to somebody else and

218
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,520
they're like and you as the security guy

219
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,050
have to be responsible that all right if

220
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,479
I have to demonstrated enough why you

221
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,460
care about this well there's a solution

222
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,680
right this is my favorite part of

223
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,388
security the academic solution and I'll

224
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,789
I'll explain you the academic solution

225
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,440
very simply to you right who here has

226
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,690
ever dealt with our ports may address

227
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,219
resolution protocol and from the

228
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,349
academic perspective there is a way to

229
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,789
100% solve our poisoning and what is

230
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:04,370
that static domain - no synthetic ARP

231
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:07,099
tables exactly do that why would you

232
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,270
never do that great question you would

233
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,370
never do that because as soon as you

234
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,740
even hit 50 machines that's untenable

235
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:18,590
right that's crazy not to be confusing

236
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:20,060
tempo which is so the situation here is

237
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,770
the same right

238
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,260
the naive approach to dealing with

239
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,210
social media security lock social media

240
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,740
now that sounds great in principle

241
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,049
accept the fact that everybody here who

242
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,820
has an organization probably has some

243
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,419
sort of presence on social media for the

244
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,919
sale the marketing or communication not

245
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,329
to mention the fact that you don't use

246
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,458
it there's a high chance that you may be

247
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,560
targeted on it so think about it an

248
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,619
organization like Walmart didn't have

249
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,239
social media and then let's say somebody

250
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,940
who do like Walmart just took over the

251
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,990
page and just posted or took in support

252
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,970
questions and answered

253
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,180
yeah you should probably go check out

254
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,300
amazon.com it's a lot quicker cheaper

255
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,290
that would not be helpful to your birth

256
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,540
additionally when you start looking at

257
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,459
the academic solution you don't consider

258
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,030
what I like to call the policy avoidance

259
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,380
samurai's for employees now when we

260
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,699
start talking about this we start

261
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,560
needing to consider the fact that we

262
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,420
actually do have security mechanisms in

263
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,800
place and part of our policies that we

264
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,870
want to enforce those security

265
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,310
mechanisms and as security practitioners

266
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,670
we want to know as much about our

267
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,859
environment as possible if we say hey no

268
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,270
social media what's not going to happen

269
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,520
is people are going to be like well the

270
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,620
policy says no social media there's no

271
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,480
social media loan here nobody can use it

272
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,160
they're gonna say why don't they just

273
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,680
use this on my phone kind of my phone

274
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,689
began into somewhere use a hotspot so on

275
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,829
so forth even though you can start

276
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,360
setting up your own wireless access

277
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,590
point I remember I did that when I was

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
in high school and a lot so it should be

279
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,800
a great time just hung it out of a

280
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,500
window with a garbage bag around it

281
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,760
right this type of thing is insane but

282
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,340
this is what people do to get around

283
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,689
policy so as soon as people start

284
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,730
violating your policies they start

285
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,160
violating other policies that unit leads

286
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,020
to benefit the organization the reigning

287
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,880
goal is really not so much to deal with

288
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,920
social media sure you care about that

289
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,360
we'll talk about some of the use cases

290
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,709
but you care more about being able to

291
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,970
see all traffic that's going through

292
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,620
your network so you know if they're

293
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,570
exfiltrating large amount of information

294
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,910
and maybe your malware detection goes

295
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,110
through the your terminating TLS to look

296
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,490
at sites and make sure they have

297
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,860
physical porn during the day whatever

298
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,900
things like that you can imagine so this

299
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,430
becomes a huge problem for us when we

300
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,990
start talking about actual employee

301
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,209
behavior when you just try and block it

302
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,800
all right so I think I've sold you on

303
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,270
the fact hopefully maybe not maybe I'm a

304
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
bad salesman deliver by the car for me

305
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,000
but I think I've sold you on the back

306
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,490
there's no

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,250
just disabling social media that's like

308
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,980
too crazy so how do we deal with this

309
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,900
well my offer to you is to from the clip

310
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,340
approach first and these are the worst

311
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,010
of the two problems look approach if

312
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,750
you're like a technical person the first

313
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,490
is that we're going to need an actual

314
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,440
policy and that policy is going to

315
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,840
describe exactly what we're expecting of

316
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,640
people to do and then the second is

317
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,980
training which is going to guide in

318
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,840
place how to do that it's kind of hold

319
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,490
their hands as they go through it it's

320
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,050
actually in singling you weren't walking

321
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,150
to an organization after being the

322
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,329
technical security lab for so long and

323
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,699
your latest heartbeat if it's bleeding

324
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,350
sequel objective this is so cool and you

325
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,850
come to the realization like my biggest

326
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,060
problems of organization is myself

327
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,560
people are going to click up that is not

328
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,630
a realization that you haven't normally

329
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,310
and this is kind of how you realize that

330
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,630
security awareness is one of the most

331
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,880
important things you do

332
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,130
hey that email that came from the CEO is

333
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,890
asking you to transfer money maybe maybe

334
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,640
just call maybe just ask right same idea

335
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:39,050
here maybe that day or that street

336
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,640
smarts that new pop up burger in New

337
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,959
York that says it's going to be awesome

338
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,100
maybe that's not legitimate maybe you

339
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,589
should question it for half a second so

340
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,930
if we do use this is there any advantage

341
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,339
well yes actually we can not only

342
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,689
leverage this from the sales and

343
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,580
marketing perspective we can leverage

344
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,100
this from the other awesome perspectives

345
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,890
that we can keep in mind my brand can

346
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,690
leverage this social media mechanism in

347
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,370
order to encourage itself in order to

348
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,970
provide capabilities that didn't have

349
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,440
before

350
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,240
like leveraging enemy

351
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,580
you might expect so think about

352
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,760
something like this someone it's like

353
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,130
hey you know I run a server company and

354
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,100
I would really really love if they have

355
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,200
cherry this soda how do they reach out

356
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,520
to the soda company to suggest that well

357
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,950
no one knows how to send a letter today

358
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,020
so that's out of the question do you

359
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,850
call someone and wait on hold to cut off

360
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,530
customer support

361
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,780
today's day that you post on Twitter you

362
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,990
post on facebook Messenger or whatever

363
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,430
hey where's your new cherry vodka I

364
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,440
really want that actually do you think

365
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,839
they have cherry vodka but in any event

366
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,030
you can use this in order to allow your

367
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,530
employees to become brand ambassadors

368
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,020
and to better represent their brand

369
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,050
going forward posting openings is a very

370
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,060
popular example of this that makes us

371
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,400
feel very good but this can also be used

372
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,619
for very bad reasons as you might

373
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,880
imagine so as soon as you start

374
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,130
providing training I'm kind of used

375
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,840
social media you suddenly become liable

376
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,090
for some of the things that might happen

377
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,610
there and then you actually have to kind

378
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,990
of regulate it a little bit within your

379
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,180
internal organization what's going to go

380
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,350
on generally this is going to be taken

381
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,640
care of by some sort of security

382
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,680
awareness training so you won't become

383
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,780
legally liable for being like hey you

384
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:28,250
must use social media and oh by the way

385
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:29,390
like but there are some other cool so we

386
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,580
went out of this employees should be

387
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,020
taught how to use social media but they

388
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,000
should also be taught how to use the

389
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,380
protections that are in place this is

390
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,730
the big thing right you can't enforce

391
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,610
people to use multi-factor

392
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,560
authentication things like Facebook we

393
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,600
can't enforce them to speak properly

394
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,880
imagine if someone was like on Twitter

395
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,070
hey like I'm looking for the new cherry

396
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,140
soda and you guys are having and the

397
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:55,300
response was like yeah homie we don't

398
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,300
got that today like what's going on baby

399
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,759
professional anta I expected like

400
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,620
essentially that automation music that

401
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,019
you hear when you call up regular phones

402
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,910
right people who have been taught to be

403
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,560
like completely neutral to the entire

404
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,350
world and have no feelings in their

405
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,079
teleport voice at all the probes as a

406
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,730
matter of Steve and that's maybe good

407
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,529
event betting on you to take on cultures

408
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,880
as a whole but that has nothing to do

409
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,319
with what we're talking about today you

410
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,149
need to tell them exactly how to

411
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:24,000
represent the company and how you want

412
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,560
that they also need to know that what

413
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,540
they're posting on the Internet can be

414
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,579
used against them how many of you have

415
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,130
liked it all of you should be raising

416
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:33,359
your hand and then how many of you are

417
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,459
obviously associated with your company

418
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,259
probably that's like a really weird

419
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,638
thing and how many of you realize the

420
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,519
email that you used to register you

421
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,290
really didn't share it by default cool

422
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,329
so you should probably check that when

423
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,579
you get home because that is a fantastic

424
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:48,750
treasure trove to get emails which can

425
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,670
then be used to try and log into

426
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,440
Facebook because it's your personal

427
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,149
email and then I'll have the news gets a

428
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,319
password and by the way to use the

429
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,440
recovery then you get some information

430
00:14:55,319 --> 00:15:00,810
about what's going on so there's like

431
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,839
way too much stuff available generally

432
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,849
and it's not the best idea so things

433
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,380
like tracking August locations

434
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,230
multi-factor authentication security

435
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,060
checkups using a single device to access

436
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,709
things additional device controls maybe

437
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,089
you played checking for impersonators

438
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,439
reporting suspicious activities of

439
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,360
waiting for gonna have a whole list here

440
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,029
it's not that interesting because we're

441
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,490
here for the sexy part of this what

442
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:30,149
could go wrong right what could possibly

443
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:30,990
go wrong we have a list here than what

444
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,240
might go wrong

445
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,490
and how this could hurt you so our

446
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,760
customers or our employees I should say

447
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,800
to our customers could make

448
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,020
since we can fulfill something mission

449
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,969
start sounding somewhat legal very

450
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,430
quickly right they could provide our

451
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,400
customers with the wrong answer hey how

452
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,099
how much clearance does my Chevy Tahoe

453
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,540
pad Oh that'll be seven feet I'm gonna

454
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,400
go over the stuff under the seven foot

455
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,620
bridge and then the roof comes off it

456
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,449
suddenly we have a big issue here and we

457
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,680
need to control what's going on of

458
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,990
course then they get into the actual

459
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,349
obvious illegal oversharing things

460
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,000
talking about where the organizations go

461
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,470
what things like the other investigation

462
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,240
what could be shared there's all sorts

463
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,460
of ramifications there and obviously

464
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,970
sharing confidential information any

465
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,920
regard is always difficult so enough

466
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,900
about the problem how do we try and

467
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,339
address this and this actually becomes

468
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,689
the really interesting part because

469
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,190
normally you would say well the

470
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,530
addressing is easy from a policy

471
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,060
perspective I say they can't say seven

472
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:32,170
things on social media regards to the

473
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,430
brand cool well that is going to get a

474
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,160
little bit difficult and we're going to

475
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,719
cover that but let's first consider what

476
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,270
is actually shared over social media

477
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,890
becomes important to you and so we need

478
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,380
to consider what our employee is

479
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,270
actually saying so I know some of you

480
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,430
are very tempted to send emails at work

481
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,410
that are like funny and snarky we were

482
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,390
like hey you know like these

483
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,829
 over there I know what

484
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,170
they're doing over in sales or whatnot

485
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,740
or in the case of silence you might say

486
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,360
something like hey silenced personality

487
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,089
even confided to each other internally

488
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,610
over email they are by the way in

489
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,280
regards to OPM this is what happens when

490
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,439
you have informal kind of conversations

491
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,449
over a formal mechanism that can men be

492
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,250
subpoenaed by Congress or the Senate

493
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,740
depending on who you're dealing with

494
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,359
this is probably not an effective

495
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,970
mechanism and from a security policy

496
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,490
perspective you should crown upon this

497
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,720
if not try and control for it now that

498
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,109
means that you're not going to have much

499
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,200
success

500
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:31,360
according to things like this right like

501
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,130
your CEOs

502
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,750
you know hey I read your email or

503
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,640
expected it and I flagged on the word

504
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:41,020
 like you can't do that she's

505
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,510
gonna be like hot yeah so okay what can

506
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,770
we honestly do we can restrict them

507
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,220
talking badly about our organization

508
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,850
right that actually turns out to be not

509
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,710
exactly true particularly in this area

510
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,419
so we can restrict and this is literally

511
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,980
what we can persuade people for making

512
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,770
statements that are blatantly or

513
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,690
maliciously false or defamatory that is

514
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,850
the literal exact words and the reason

515
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,580
why we can do this or we can or cannot

516
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,799
do this is due to the National Labor

517
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,659
Relations Act now some of you are

518
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,918
probably familiar at least in passing

519
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,660
with this because many of you're

520
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,010
familiar with the law that protects you

521
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,440
from being able to discuss how much

522
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:22,059
money you make with your coworkers is

523
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,870
everyone congratulations you're legally

524
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:30,549
protected cannot be fired for Congress

525
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:38,830
in the United States the National Labor

526
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:40,270
Relations Act yeah well here we go

527
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,760
you're about to learning tomorrow

528
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,020
there's this one section here that is

529
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,850
actually worth reading the rights of

530
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,500
self-organization the form join our

531
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,600
excess labor organizations to firmly

532
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,160
collectively the representation of their

533
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,719
own choosing and to engage in other

534
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,549
concerted activities to find the

535
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,140
concerted activities term for the

536
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,389
purpose of collective bargaining or

537
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,929
other mutual aid or protection as well

538
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,600
as the right to refrain from any what

539
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,910
does that sound like it should sound

540
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,840
like unions right like I hear unions

541
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,640
irate that merely what I hear versus

542
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,418
what my actual legal minds here is

543
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,419
cluded

544
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,799
so the collective bargaining part or the

545
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,270
concerted effort for collective

546
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,160
bargaining

547
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,690
and mutual aid is actually what's really

548
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,910
going to give us divine power

549
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,860
so while private companies don't have

550
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,010
the constitutional duty to allow you

551
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,050
know that whole free speech don't can't

552
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,640
when you were like four and you walked

553
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,169
into it we're hoping your life freedom

554
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,429
of speech I can say whatever you want

555
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,620
and they're like this is a school shut

556
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:39,540
the up that's because they're not

557
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,409
required to actually enforce the First

558
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,389
Amendment wealth

559
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,800
whichever amendment the entire area

560
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,800
doesn't necessarily apply to them

561
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,159
however there is litigation that's in

562
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,590
place and the NRL NLRB is responsible

563
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,570
for enforcing it that actually protects

564
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,939
you as an employee from saying and doing

565
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,260
certain things so this is good news for

566
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,360
you bad news for you as a security

567
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,129
person and it's bad news to you as a

568
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,449
security person because it essentially

569
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,730
allows you to do these things right

570
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,429
engaging in you night to be cold we got

571
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,520
that necessarily too much apply to us

572
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:13,140
protected concerted activity and that's

573
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,950
what we're going to any active that's

574
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,420
what we're going to be concerned with

575
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,390
any activity is considered protected

576
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,790
concerted activity if it's when an

577
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,980
employee acts well with or on the

578
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:25,559
authority of other employees and not

579
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,620
solely by on behalf of the employee

580
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,809
themselves well that sounds like if I

581
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,949
work with any other employee then I'm

582
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,899
pretty much covered and we're going to

583
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,220
see that actually come to fruition

584
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,050
there's a couple of other things that

585
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,000
the NLRB covers you should definitely

586
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,168
look into this if you're interested some

587
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,399
of these are really interesting

588
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:46,259
share information about pay benefits

589
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:47,428
working conditions cool so now we

590
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,869
started talking about what the limits

591
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:50,369
are what we can say and this is the

592
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:51,809
actual interesting part of the stock in

593
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,100
my I'm actually kind of happy that like

594
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,710
10 people showed up so that was pretty

595
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,969
cool of you guys so the first one we

596
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,379
want to talk about it's really like the

597
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,679
first case that we have here this is

598
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:03,330
2010 and Buffalo right up the street we

599
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,090
feel good to some Buffalo fans in the

600
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,850
back right so a worker posted on

601
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,830
Facebook that another employee felt that

602
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,259
that her co-worker did not help you the

603
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,539
employees clients enough and she

604
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:17,759
literally asked how other employees how

605
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,200
other co-workers felt about it and they

606
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,789
all responded and there was like

607
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,320
swearing essentially they were like I

608
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,609
don't think this person says you

609
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,158
know you can imagine that this might be

610
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:28,049
and then all four people who responded

611
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,659
in the original cover the original

612
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,190
poster were fire now you might say why

613
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,869
were they talking about work in a public

614
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,519
media where customers my vehicle see

615
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:37,259
that seems like outside of the scope

616
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,840
that seems perfectly within my rights as

617
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,940
an employer to fire them you would be

618
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,738
wrong it was family organization

619
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,529
unlawfully disturbed by the point

620
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:49,139
because Facebook posts are both

621
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,869
concerted activities in this particular

622
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:53,340
case cuz there's more than one employee

623
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,949
according to Phil versus the NLRB from

624
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,629
1986 that didn't obviously records

625
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,509
Facebook never was concerned activities

626
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:02,850
being protected alright cool so check

627
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:05,309
only Facebook is a protected activity to

628
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,559
do with a bunch of employees so how hard

629
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,330
is this Gil cops know had a policy

630
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,619
prohibiting and damage the company the

631
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,570
thing that the individual would damage

632
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:14,939
the personification of violate policies

633
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,439
outlined the cosmically agree this looks

634
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,059
like something we would all right I'm

635
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,820
pretty sure most of us would write

636
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:23,580
something like this this is just too

637
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,710
broad right this clearly encompasses

638
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,760
concerted communications particularly

639
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,710
labor communication

640
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,690
did you go forward it was ruled that it

641
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,780
was not a valid security policy and they

642
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,530
had to change it is not enforceable does

643
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,860
it go further

644
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:40,080
I'm glad you messed DIRECTV do not

645
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,639
contact media I would definitely agree

646
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,918
with them as the security person village

647
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,110
don't talk to anybody right like your

648
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,230
employee until I tell you so you have no

649
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,809
boss okay so we keep going employees not

650
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,010
blog and to chatrooms post messages or

651
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:56,639
otherwise discuss company information

652
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:59,129
disclosed on public record all right

653
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,900
that sounds a pretty good however it was

654
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,490
ruled that of course section seven

655
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,860
encompasses these employee

656
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,770
communications about labor disputes with

657
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,260
newspaper reporters this is protected

658
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,240
concerted activity you can't just bar

659
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,250
everything like this as you go all right

660
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,500
it also doesn't describe what company

661
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,880
information is protected here and it

662
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,980
could include salary information

663
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,929
information about working environment

664
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,140
things that we previously saw were

665
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:26,309
protected so in this particular case

666
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,290
statements of the policy are not

667
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,629
intended to the statements in this

668
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:34,200
policy were not intended to restrict the

669
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,150
actual section 7 qualifications and even

670
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,830
if they had what the qualification that

671
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,890
this does not explicitly apply to

672
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,620
section 7 elements this by itself does

673
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,450
not make legitimate policy or I'm sorry

674
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,280
illegitimate policy legitimate so you

675
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,780
can't just be like hey this is true

676
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,668
except for all the places where it's not

677
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,889
true you have to be very specific about

678
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,110
what is and is not allowed this sounds

679
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,870
awful litigious that's because it isn't

680
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,000
interesting alright so we start getting

681
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,530
into some more like crazy areas this is

682
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,490
gonna be like the last example but this

683
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:09,840
one's pretty fun so the we have this

684
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:12,450
like our that's going on and there we go

685
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,020
so a triple play Sports Bar & Grill is a

686
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,940
non-union bar and restricted sorry

687
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,559
restaurant and terminated two employees

688
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,570
for their Facebook discussion about the

689
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,809
company's tax withholding practices a

690
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,939
former employee initiative the

691
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:29,349
by posting on Facebook status that the

692
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,519
organization should maybe do something

693
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:34,189
maybe someone should do something about

694
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,539
triple play and do them a favor and buy

695
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,669
them out so they can't even do their own

696
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,269
tax paperwork correctly now I don't

697
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,369
money

698
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:43,729
what the and then a second employee

699
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:45,320
so this is one employee first and then

700
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:49,909
the second employee followed up and said

701
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,580
I owe to such an [ __ ] right cool not

702
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:54,769
exactly the most like clear thing the

703
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,619
interesting part here is what we're

704
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:59,659
seeing is that there's two employees who

705
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,749
are taking into account some type of

706
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:05,239
labor dispute on Facebook and as a

707
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:07,519
result this actual communication was

708
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:08,570
considered protected and they would not

709
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,039
allow to be fired

710
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,629
now this one went a little bit further

711
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,979
because they fire metal than those two

712
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:16,248
people but another person who was

713
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:18,379
involved who just like the post it turns

714
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:20,659
out that Facebook lights our concerted

715
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:22,939
efforts that are protected so you

716
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:26,479
literally can't fire people for liking

717
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,619
posts if they're undercover groups now

718
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:29,389
keep in mind that there's some

719
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:30,678
interesting caveats here it was just the

720
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,029
one person and there wasn't any

721
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,609
communication and that's a different

722
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,249
thing altogether the other thing that's

723
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:39,259
interesting here is that other not only

724
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,989
employees commented with customers

725
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:44,119
commented on us so you're thinking wait

726
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:45,649
can't my policy say something like you

727
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,689
can't discuss this type of stuff in the

728
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:49,488
presence of customers but you need to

729
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,679
remember that in fact you need to be

730
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:53,989
able to have labor disputes in front of

731
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,969
customers in this particular case the

732
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:59,149
alarm be compared this to having the

733
00:25:55,969 --> 00:26:01,609
conversation between co-workers at the

734
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:03,010
office place but now you're inside the

735
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:04,570
hearing range of customers but

736
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,250
the normal kind of area when they would

737
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,980
be so if you're on the side just talking

738
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,960
amongst yourself alright so one of the

739
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,510
different guidelines let's go kind of

740
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,460
move this a little bit along no language

741
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,480
is disparaging embarrassing defamatory

742
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,250
unprofessional

743
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,470
can't say that you really need to be

744
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,760
clear about what your examples are when

745
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,670
you're talking about because obviously

746
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,200
there there is inappropriate language

747
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,870
that you are allowed to use in the

748
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,330
context of a labor dispute you can call

749
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,820
people [ __ ] from my file on

750
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,159
your taxes it is protected that's the

751
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,290
who the DiNapoli's picture company logos

752
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,820
facilities uniforms this is great for

753
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,010
social engineering because this is

754
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,720
protected you can't actually do that you

755
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,250
can't restrict that because people need

756
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,710
to hold up picket signs with your face

757
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,940
cross down on top of it we're not this

758
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,860
has private confidential information

759
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,540
assets with really bad the security

760
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,969
perspective but of course it is

761
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,530
protected you need to be able to find

762
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,560
what that confidential information is

763
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,570
specifically this can include wages or

764
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,100
work information do not use the

765
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,530
company's data information and social

766
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,120
media profile of course again this

767
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,860
Hindus information about discussing

768
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,050
their employment situation with other

769
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,820
covers taking forever

770
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,409
prior to role before posting something

771
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,919
to talk to the media we talked about why

772
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:19,750
can't say that report unusual and

773
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,780
inappropriate internal social media

774
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,700
activity way way way too broad just way

775
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,590
too broad right imagine what that covers

776
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,060
it covers almost everything you need to

777
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,480
be much more specific about what this

778
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,960
means

779
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,640
no commenting on legal matters employees

780
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,290
are engaged for legal matters all the

781
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,940
time and they are allowed to comment on

782
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,830
it and you need to be very clear about

783
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,420
what they can cannot comment on and

784
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,710
they're participating in social media

785
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,740
communications using company resources

786
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,279
and or

787
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,010
besides this the best right you

788
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:50,840
literally cannot do that you have to

789
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,179
give them the mechanism to communicate

790
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,399
amongst themselves on company time there

791
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:58,039
was one case where this person went off

792
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,289
and communicated the value during their

793
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,520
lunch time and they fired her and they

794
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:03,080
were like of course you can't do that

795
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,929
and even if she didn't do it during

796
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,610
lunch you still can't do you can't hire

797
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:10,460
people for communicating information

798
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:13,760
about their office place over any

799
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,289
mechanism they choose so cool even if

800
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,220
you wanted to do the naive approach it's

801
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:21,649
technically not allowed all right so

802
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,450
when we talk about actualities sure I

803
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,979
can say this also you blow the face and

804
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,860
what it means is that you might get sued

805
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,270
and you may or may not lose but in

806
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,549
reality if they do something to creat

807
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,200
just like many of you remember this

808
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,539
particular tweet that I will read out

809
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,610
right now going to Africa hope I don't

810
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,320
get AIDS just kidding I'm white you guys

811
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,889
remember that like ridiculously

812
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,110
insulting tweet it so she got fired for

813
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,149
that interestingly enough if you didn't

814
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,520
realize this she got rehired at the same

815
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:51,080
firm not because she sued them just

816
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,330
because they thought that she only had

817
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,770
one horrible racist incident and that

818
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,460
was something to make them look over I

819
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:00,049
guess crazy but in any event you

820
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,429
obviously can still get fired in things

821
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,289
like this there's still things you can

822
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:08,570
do that are like blatantly false or

823
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:10,190
egregious so just because it's they can

824
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,770
put restrictions on place doesn't mean

825
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,679
that you can necessarily enforce those

826
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,840
restrictions you'll have to sue in some

827
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,669
cases however there are other

828
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,559
protections that apply to social media

829
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:24,230
postings now this is a particularly

830
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,870
interesting social media post our scores

831
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,830
there is case precedent for that being

832
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,080
protected under the stored

833
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:33,010
Communications Act now that sounds like

834
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,530
really maintained my lawyer

835
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,030
Laurie what does that mean well a story

836
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,290
communication that essentially means

837
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,240
that you're like not allowed to store

838
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:43,090
other people's information that's really

839
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,880
what it is without consent so in this

840
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,500
particular case storing people's

841
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,160
Facebook post accessing the legal link

842
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,780
storing it accessing their posts I guess

843
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,600
in this case but would be illegally

844
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,510
that's now finds in a real prison time

845
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,709
can be if someone broke into your

846
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,390
computer and stole access to your

847
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,580
Facebook and downloaded that stored it

848
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:07,450
you they'll be under violation of yes

849
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,070
yeah however this puts the employers in

850
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,230
a really awkward situation as you might

851
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,939
expect and that awkward situation is how

852
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,500
many of you actually determinates Els

853
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,679
inside of your organization to look at

854
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,220
what people are looking at if you work

855
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,380
at RTV answers yes if you were hope so I

856
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,750
hope it's most of you honestly I don't

857
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,490
know how many Duty teams well but like

858
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,040
any sort of device that you're gonna put

859
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,020
in line like your Meraki devices with

860
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,690
IDs it's pretty much any IDs will

861
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,970
terminate and then undo donation they'd

862
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:40,120
all be better does this mean that you

863
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,770
can't store people's Facebook it's a

864
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,149
great question generally speaking you're

865
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,520
allowed to kind of get away with this as

866
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,530
the current ruling has as long as you're

867
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,910
not specifically pulling it out and

868
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,309
storing it for the reason that you're

869
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,230
looking for Facebook information so

870
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:57,460
you're allowed to like generally look at

871
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,350
all traffic that goes through your

872
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,760
device however that goes through your

873
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,020
network or you can restrict what people

874
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,300
can talk about

875
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,400
as we've just seen and some of that

876
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,690
information is protected can anyone

877
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,600
think of some information that might be

878
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:15,180
protected if I can generate blood work I

879
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,179
should have listened the entire question

880
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:24,129
what we're going to say so so here's the

881
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,050
interesting one HIV status is protected

882
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,060
on state-by-state basis we don't

883
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:32,230
ordinarily think of it as like Social

884
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:33,909
Security numbers that is an interesting

885
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,470
one and you're like straight up the

886
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,700
right track because the one thing that

887
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,620
you've got to think about is that there

888
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,980
are some particularly protected

889
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,689
communications and you might have

890
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,980
doctor-patient confidentiality right so

891
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,230
all of that is protected or

892
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,450
attorney-client privilege is protected

893
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,630
so the crazy thing I have to explain

894
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,460
this to my wonderful HR department and I

895
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,670
mean that in the nicest way is like

896
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,460
literally someone can sue a company and

897
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:02,770
then talk about suing the company with

898
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,720
their lawyer from their company email

899
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,300
and you're not allowed to look at that

900
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,430
that's protected conversation and if you

901
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,960
do look at that and through the course

902
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,510
of the street and all these problems and

903
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,310
all that goes out the window so you have

904
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,890
all these kind of other situations where

905
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,379
your information that is traversing your

906
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,110
network may become a little bit tenuous

907
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:26,500
Natasha

908
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:28,060
so can you explain things yes of course

909
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,140
you can restrict our employees granted

910
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,780
that you can't restrict their

911
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,300
association as being policies saying

912
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,980
that's a little bit too product like

913
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,899
because all private posts have to say

914
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,370
that their employee only things that are

915
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,110
related to being an employee can be

916
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,629
restricted to having to put a disclosure

917
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,399
in place so just some interesting things

918
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,840
to know you can't require them to put a

919
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,520
disclosure that they are an employee of

920
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,990
the company however you must restrict

921
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,210
that

922
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,880
employment employment conversations that

923
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,450
can be unneeded ly burdensome as you go

924
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,610
:

925
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,200
if this sounds ridiculous you should

926
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,479
imagine what this policy looks like what

927
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,620
you're done it's essentially like you

928
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,559
should have a good time

929
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,320
please use social media responsibly and

930
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,809
will actually show you a policy or will

931
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,800
link to a policy that does that so there

932
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,149
are a couple of other things that we

933
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,860
need to take into account when we

934
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,690
started dealing with overall

935
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,090
conversations about social media

936
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,250
security generally managers as friends

937
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,139
becomes a sticky topic and it becomes a

938
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,020
particularly to be sticky topic because

939
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,020
the terminology that you're allowed to

940
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,510
use when you conduct conversations with

941
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,690
employees is actually based on your

942
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:36,450
culture so there was a particular case

943
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,990
where someone called there was a status

944
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,210
that said that the owner of a company

945
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:44,640
the company's Multipure 60 was a nasty

946
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,590
 on facebook without any

947
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,059
type of consequences and the reason why

948
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,280
they did that is because they determined

949
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,899
that at the company the culture already

950
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,120
supported people saying things like

951
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,600
 normally so what sit out of

952
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:03,209
line to do that and I know both of you

953
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,439
are thinking that's my company so some

954
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,179
of the conference's that they have

955
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:11,399
internally so just be aware that like

956
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,540
trying to regulate what employees are

957
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,580
able to say it's going to be very

958
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,290
tenuous for you it also means that you

959
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,879
once you start trying to regulate it you

960
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,580
have to deal with issues like harassment

961
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,620
so it's often recommended

962
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,389
teachers don't become friends with

963
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,730
subordinates because as soon as they see

964
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,170
something but therefore responsible for

965
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,150
dealing with it in terms of policies

966
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,139
that you've laid out that becomes very

967
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,090
difficult because there's some

968
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,739
synergistic like gains from being

969
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,360
friends with your manager hopefully you

970
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,790
like your manager enough to like let

971
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,830
them see drunk on a weekend which is

972
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:45,960
what all my facebook photos are but I

973
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:47,940
know in general this is frowned upon but

974
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,270
in actuality this is very hard to

975
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,620
practice alright cool so we have a

976
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,480
pretty good understanding of what we can

977
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,839
and cannot restrict our employees to do

978
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,330
I can't in good good faith leave you

979
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,250
with the social media screws without

980
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,529
talking about corporate accounts because

981
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:07,080
they're important they're important

982
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,370
because if you're an adult and you are

983
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,299
asked to twerk for me mom it's just just

984
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,950
not acceptable

985
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,320
right like you can't allow this to go

986
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,779
forward so how do you deal with this

987
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,010
type of situation well hopefully you're

988
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,410
going to have some sort of disaster

989
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,820
recovery policy so secondary form of

990
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,529
logging into a system that can be easily

991
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,720
changed you're also gonna have some

992
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,520
monitoring that is going on about the

993
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,189
situation I'll leave that as an exercise

994
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,980
for the consumer to find to be possible

995
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,840
options there are also solutions in

996
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,700
terms of impersonations so you're not

997
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,200
just restricted to people taking over

998
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,750
your account but pretending to be you

999
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,730
can be equally disastrous there are some

1000
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,870
capabilities in terms of verification

1001
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,080
and we'll take a look at them in a

1002
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,940
couple second however you're relying on

1003
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,680
the organization the other like social

1004
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,240
media organization to provide that so

1005
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,000
people who are generally targets for

1006
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,290
this include grants as you might expect

1007
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,630
CEOs can be particularly troublesome

1008
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,440
because obviously there's a trust play

1009
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,290
that you can do

1010
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,540
social media regular employees are

1011
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,980
fantastic friend other employees getting

1012
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,190
digital information at my beauty like

1013
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,110
that so let's place pasta verification

1014
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,450
I'm going to give you like 5 seconds and

1015
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:21,630
just yell out left or right which one is

1016
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:24,750
fake what all right yeah so this one on

1017
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:30,800
the left is fake this one already you

1018
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,800
clearly see is verified right this is

1019
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:37,140
and this is totally possibly used today

1020
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:40,530
obviously this is obviously a Photoshop

1021
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,480
example but generally speaking this is

1022
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,730
the kind of verification that we're

1023
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,040
talking about as a consumer this is a

1024
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,810
room for security people this wasn't

1025
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,450
immediately obvious which one was fake

1026
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,980
like it wasn't I put more of a

1027
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,310
separation so it was easier for the I

1028
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,310
liked still that being said going

1029
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,930
forward you need to realize that these

1030
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,700
types of things tends to be used for

1031
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,799
advertising revenue that can be used for

1032
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,080
poisoning kind of well communications

1033
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,210
with other companies or withing with

1034
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,680
customers so it can be a serious problem

1035
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,070
for your grant if you have fake

1036
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,109
organizations in person and again you

1037
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,210
can also use this this is a somewhat

1038
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,980
recent event I guess this is a year old

1039
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,890
at this point but I really like this

1040
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,600
this had like ten thousand people who

1041
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,910
are attending this in and out pop-ups

1042
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,740
and in New York City this was completely

1043
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,509
fake you can see all these posts there

1044
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,850
like this is not real is coming like

1045
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,740
well you can imagine how many of these I

1046
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,610
recently saw Rick and Morty pop up in

1047
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,229
Washington DC

1048
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,080
I'm not sure if that was real but like

1049
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,240
it's just fake Facebook anyone can make

1050
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,830
making them popular and the more likes

1051
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,990
you get the more kind of advertising

1052
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,759
money you can sell you can try and get

1053
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,770
them into a place and make them pay five

1054
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:57,510
dollars or whatever it is that people do

1055
00:37:49,770 --> 00:38:16,100
these days I'm not with all the users or

1056
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:18,360
the viewers really disappointed that

1057
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,190
obviously my own fault and I can click

1058
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,570
on em I see pop-ups and follow up on

1059
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,100
that organization to see if it's

1060
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,560
legitimately associated within it now

1061
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,180
but people actually the interesting

1062
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,370
thing people think of the south is they

1063
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,779
hit up in and out on facebook Messenger

1064
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,779
and they're like did you see this

1065
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,340
so what was it eighty-six Crosby Street

1066
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,420
or 92 Crosby my guess would be that this

1067
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,400
is someone's company

1068
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,440
someone has like an eatery that sells

1069
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,510
like probably hamburgers or something

1070
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,790
and they just throw out anything out or

1071
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,300
they were planning to show pop-ups who

1072
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:58,710
will eat it yeah there they go

1073
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,420
you can do the research so what actually

1074
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,340
can you take against Impostors this

1075
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,520
because the interesting thing it becomes

1076
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,140
quite tedious to try and take down posts

1077
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,630
on social media particularly if you have

1078
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,700
a lot of them this actually can be a

1079
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,340
little bit complicated to do also like

1080
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,470
in certain situations I know that as

1081
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,030
part of the organization we have to take

1082
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,669
down services for this type of thing and

1083
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,860
they've tried to take down a literal

1084
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,020
duplicated photo of the person who they

1085
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,480
were trying to protect so imagine if it

1086
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,090
was this young man over here his photo

1087
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,770
on his personal profile and then there

1088
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,630
was a fake one that had the same photo

1089
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,720
and you were like hammer said this

1090
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,859
person take this down they were like

1091
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,180
right a debt-based book sole discretion

1092
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,710
well they're gonna take down now they

1093
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,930
have guidelines and policies just like

1094
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,480
everybody else but they can talk or how

1095
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,308
they want to do that it's a mole it's a

1096
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,400
maul perfect gay people it's mom yeah

1097
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:51,900
that's a there's like bananas oh ho

1098
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,980
although some shoe stories and you know

1099
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:59,009
there's not there's not in them yeah so

1100
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,380
this is still a really painful kind of

1101
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:05,039
area to build takedowns in this respect

1102
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,599
certain social media areas are better at

1103
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,680
doing this than others they kind of go

1104
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,359
up and down in terms of their

1105
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,279
responsiveness and you can imagine it

1106
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,799
that doing this on their own is actually

1107
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:15,269
a problem like a talking to itself how

1108
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:17,059
do I determine if that posture is really

1109
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:21,209
an impostor when someone sends a request

1110
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:23,099
anyway it you can also file a lawsuit

1111
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,660
now what's the interesting case if

1112
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,970
there's nothing like a legal amount

1113
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,649
about impersonatin people on Facebook

1114
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,269
that's just not a thing right now

1115
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,180
there's no blog even in New York State

1116
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:34,470
just crazy laws about crazy things

1117
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,690
that's not the case so you can file a

1118
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,160
civil lawsuit for like defamation or

1119
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,339
emotional distress and this has been

1120
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,989
done I would call it not very effective

1121
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:46,019
and probably a huge waste of your budget

1122
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:48,539
to do so given keeping in mind that when

1123
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:50,129
you do this you also have to be confined

1124
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:51,930
by these particular standards that these

1125
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,630
people set out so for instance Twitter

1126
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,190
will inform the user that you are trying

1127
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,259
to do a takedown on them this is dreamer

1128
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,339
Facebook as well so they'll get your

1129
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:01,619
email address an email address

1130
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,999
associated with the takedown and that

1131
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,819
might be enough for some sort of

1132
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:07,980
retaliatory action and of course they

1133
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:09,839
will only give up information on users

1134
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,369
when there's a legal basis so even if

1135
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,839
you're trying to get information on do

1136
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:16,109
this and possibly might be

1137
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,239
the capability that you're offering all

1138
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:21,479
right so we're almost almost kind of

1139
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,069
have this generally who's going to try

1140
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,390
to do this imposter detection well this

1141
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:25,920
is typically going to look like people

1142
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,359
are going to manually put this in there

1143
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,969
use some sort of algorithm generated

1144
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,369
variations of brand name ceilings

1145
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:34,200
whatever employed names typically left

1146
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,910
to information security which is great

1147
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,939
right because one more thing we all

1148
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,098
needed to do and generally this is going

1149
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,900
to be like a human driven element there

1150
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,969
are some automation capabilities but

1151
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,319
it's going to require looking at names

1152
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:50,789
images like statuses whatever you can

1153
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:53,099
imagine the whole gamut going forward

1154
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,710
that's actually quite detailed things

1155
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:59,609
that we lean on me so it's pretty

1156
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:01,019
painful corporate policy going forward

1157
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:04,049
how should I try and deal with this for

1158
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:05,430
my other corporate past well first the

1159
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:07,680
suggestion is that you choose one

1160
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,868
application to manage your open account

1161
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,700
so if using Twitter and you like to use

1162
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:13,589
the Twitter app use the term Apple if

1163
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,210
you like good sweet use HootSuite only

1164
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:16,619
if using Facebook that you want to use

1165
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,569
the official Facebook app use the

1166
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,130
official Facebook then why would I say

1167
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,749
something like that because that

1168
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,359
information is available in the logs

1169
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:25,709
about who logged in locked in there the

1170
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,288
same thing is true from where you're

1171
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,869
logging in from and the actual times

1172
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:32,489
that your life maybe's regular regular

1173
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:34,289
you can do the same things that the tom

1174
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:36,599
was talking about is breath test part

1175
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:39,680
where you actually flow these into your

1176
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,930
aggregator and then rid of rule and

1177
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,868
whatever that takes care of this and

1178
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:46,069
tries to determine where this happens

1179
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:47,359
additionally you really kind of gotta be

1180
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:49,279
careful if you're running an

1181
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,290
organization you can imagine if you're

1182
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,819
like Reading Rainbow I don't think

1183
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,770
that's Jose anymore so this is a good

1184
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:55,819
example if you were writing that page

1185
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,240
you definitely don't want someone

1186
00:42:55,819 --> 00:43:00,410
posting about like Lizard Men or like

1187
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,279
screwing things that could send these

1188
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,808
posting group pictures lewd issues so

1189
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,400
you need to be able to carefully take

1190
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:09,500
care of these and that might be a person

1191
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,849
that you have to full-time hire or these

1192
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,589
partially hired from the marketing

1193
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:14,119
department sounds like a lot of extra

1194
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:17,589
work and you can imagine that this

1195
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,910
policy would be very difficult to play

1196
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:22,009
additionally obviously you want to

1197
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,480
leverage what people can cannot post up

1198
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,130
your account we talked about that it's

1199
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,230
going forward and we want to actually

1200
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,349
make sure that we're paying attention to

1201
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:39,650
how the individuals were getting access

1202
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:41,359
to the accounts don't if I unemployed

1203
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:45,490
leave in charge of the corporate Twitter

1204
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,490
each of us remember that record store

1205
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,750
this is exactly the point

1206
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,130
right and this is very difficult to

1207
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,079
control beyond your normal operating

1208
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,510
situation because you usually have one

1209
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,369
or maybe ten employees to be able to

1210
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:02,230
social media and it's not like you just

1211
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,230
revoke their any credits in like they

1212
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,829
cool so keeping that in mind we have

1213
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,420
some good resources this is a collection

1214
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:12,950
of social media policies it's a bit

1215
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,329
outdated but there's like hundreds of

1216
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,069
them on there so if you're looking for

1217
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,650
examples of terminology that's probably

1218
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:21,109
bad this is exactly we go if you want to

1219
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,819
see like an animal IRB approved one you

1220
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:24,670
should read the Walmart one now what's

1221
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:26,410
interesting about one is

1222
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,260
has like one line about social media

1223
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:31,240
that's like you social media responsibly

1224
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,400
and that's it and that's why it's in a

1225
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,740
lot of meet approved so that's like a

1226
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,549
little bit disheartening generally

1227
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,720
speaking you're probably best

1228
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:42,280
understanding what the risks are and

1229
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,169
talking with your lawyer beforehand

1230
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,440
about what the risks might be for your

1231
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,730
social media policies and then trying to

1232
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,460
scale the back given the information

1233
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,079
that you know about this trying to take

1234
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,339
into account that employees are

1235
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,720
protected in certain situations and

1236
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:57,160
putting that in something like well you

1237
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,140
can't make these things except in

1238
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,000
relations law I should mention that that

1239
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,308
does make social media policies really

1240
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,049
awkward to read where it's like don't

1241
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:07,450
don't talk negatively about the company

1242
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:11,829
on social media except in blah blah blah

1243
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:15,308
and you're like wait as an employee to

1244
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:17,319
read policies like that's amazing but as

1245
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:20,049
an employer who writes policies that's

1246
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:21,160
awful so but any of it definitely take a

1247
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:23,259
look at the Walmart one if you're

1248
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,848
interested and once again NLRB approved

1249
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,440
one and take a look at these other books

1250
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:29,290
for inspiration of what may or may not

1251
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:37,030
be valid and with that we're gonna move

1252
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:40,270
on to the questions my tweets have

1253
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,920
nothing to do with my company matter and

1254
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,509
as we just saw here so the question help

1255
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,099
you repeat that is does the Twitter

1256
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,049
respect if I tweet something to do with

1257
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,760
the company actually valid as we say

1258
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:50,319
you're may or may not be known actually

1259
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,319
depending on what your company's

1260
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,730
requirements are it maybe disassociate

1261
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:56,829
from the company may be required by the

1262
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,440
company to say that so that you're not

1263
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:00,880
reflecting upon though I certainly seen

1264
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,940
things like that not just on tweets but

1265
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,619
also on polyps where people come

1266
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,410
I'm not associated with my company at

1267
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:13,230
this point no hold my thoughts for that

1268
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:16,558
oh yeah so for the example need be

1269
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:18,359
horribly racist week let's suppose some

1270
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,700
other employee joined in and like like

1271
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:24,558
the horribly racist tweet which was

1272
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,558
about the workplace environment is that

1273
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,589
communication yeah that's a great

1274
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:31,589
question so one of the first things that

1275
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:32,788
we saw and I want to make sure that we

1276
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:35,910
done this here we go

1277
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:37,650
so no conservative protection no

1278
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,480
legislation in the u.s. offering

1279
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,420
protections if the states are blatantly

1280
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,880
or maliciously also mandatory so in this

1281
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,650
particular case racist things are

1282
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,349
probably considered the territory in

1283
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:50,970
almost every place in the country it's

1284
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:53,160
up to the court to really interpret that

1285
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:55,950
but I think you would be probably good

1286
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,720
so the answer is probably yes if there's

1287
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:01,430
no racist thing probably know if there

1288
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,430
is a racist thing that makes any sense

1289
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:13,470
- on social media

1290
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:13,470
what about forward is there any way

1291
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,640
so the question is what about former

1292
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,890
employees and what can they share on

1293
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,600
Facebook booking the employer this

1294
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,490
country is great for many reasons and

1295
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,299
one of it is that we have a relationship

1296
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:35,160
is very strong between contracts and

1297
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:37,530
your status your legal capabilities so

1298
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,350
in a non-lawyer way of saying this

1299
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,760
because I'm not a lawyer again if you

1300
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,830
make an employee sign the non-disclosure

1301
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,810
agreement after the fact that they're

1302
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,190
still bound by that non-disclosure or

1303
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,140
any other agreement that they signs of

1304
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,900
that effect after the fact now make sure

1305
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:55,049
that your agreement is legally tight

1306
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:57,690
employer and you're probably good to go

1307
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:59,820
now the question becomes what happens

1308
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,680
after that NDA expires and they're just

1309
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,360
like hey here's all this stuff about my

1310
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,089
company I used to work at particularly

1311
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,580
of interest imagine like a red team

1312
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,840
right how crazy would that be I don't

1313
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,290
actually know the answer to that right

1314
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,580
now

1315
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,040
that's a great question I'll make sure

1316
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:16,620
to ask a real lawyer at some point so

1317
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:25,350
this is a question to put a point on it

1318
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:27,330
would be to these NLRB probably not I

1319
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,970
mean you certainly soon after you're

1320
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,529
terminated for wrongful termination

1321
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:35,310
becomes for conduct that happen water

1322
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,850
yes after it I don't believe that the

1323
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,279
NLRB

1324
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:40,049
regulations apply but it would

1325
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,480
definitely depart talking to the lawyer

1326
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:52,440
first before definitively saying that I

1327
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:54,240
covered my lawyer said you want to get

1328
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,010
any flavor type so these were all none

1329
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,759
of these were like statutory law they

1330
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:01,910
weren't criminal

1331
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:04,560
they were NLRB administrative rules and

1332
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:12,690
administrative well these cases they

1333
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:15,029
reference and then all the the opinions

1334
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:21,540
came out of administrative court

1335
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:23,670
proceedings yeah so like doing it's a

1336
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,490
little bit tricky because typically

1337
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,260
they'll make a ruling based on a law

1338
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,750
lawsuit that is brought typically a

1339
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:33,090
civil lawsuits of regarding and it is

1340
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,670
generally the precedents that are built

1341
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:38,130
up are available online and many of them

1342
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,890
are presents directly their case law so

1343
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:44,040
they become part of the president's that

1344
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:46,290
are established case law however as you

1345
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,270
are correctly pointing out the NLRB kind

1346
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:51,300
of operates of this extra judicial

1347
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:54,060
branch and it doesn't necessarily like

1348
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,980
you don't bring like an NLRB advocate

1349
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,480
with you before if you like here's tell

1350
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,590
me tell me where you just told me all

1351
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,470
right judge did you hear what he said

1352
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:04,380
like this case is dismissed that's not

1353
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:06,839
generally how it goes that is a pretty

1354
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,940
astute point and it's a little bit

1355
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:13,050
complicated to navigate that scene

1356
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,780
correctly and that is a good kind of

1357
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,700
link asterisk to put office so one thing

1358
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,110
kind of correlating those cases I

1359
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,890
noticed that those who are all under

1360
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:25,140
Obama's NLRB and depending on how the

1361
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,870
finding those decisions are you might

1362
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,259
get very different results on dirt drop

1363
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:33,690
that is possible I'm not quite sure how

1364
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,010
politically connected the NLRB is my

1365
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,320
understanding is actually that it's

1366
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:39,030
still pretty stripped in terms of its

1367
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,130
interpretation of social media policies

1368
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,140
particularly but that's not to say that

1369
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,630
I can't change based on will of like a

1370
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,259
particular president at this point now

1371
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:50,980
that there's too much care

1372
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,600
I'm sure there's some conversation

1373
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:56,110
that's happening somewhere that's a

1374
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,110
really good point

1375
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,750
I stayed at a holiday honestly a lot of

1376
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:06,530
employers what they're doing now is

1377
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:09,050
having you sign an NDA on the way what

1378
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,850
they're also doing is illegal sublet

1379
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,430
companies or illegally tired

1380
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:16,990
it's a layoff they're illegally time

1381
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:19,399
severance package to signing that NDA

1382
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:21,500
yeah there's all sorts of so that was

1383
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,300
gonna be my initial things layup signing

1384
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,340
the contract on the way out why did you

1385
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,840
do that

1386
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,670
never sign anything unless you have to

1387
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,890
and you're all the way out there just

1388
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,800
like peace and it's always good you're

1389
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,310
such a bias is if something doesn't look

1390
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,530
right

1391
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:40,910
don't sign it take it to a labor

1392
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:44,690
attorney yeah always good advice to the

1393
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:46,220
lawyers on sometimes constantly now it's

1394
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,870
interesting to note that like there is a

1395
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,080
technical definition of what severance

1396
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:52,819
packages and take good time you get an

1397
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:56,990
additional money that's not a severance

1398
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:58,550
package to you sign an NDA now that

1399
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,839
would have to be like a pretty good

1400
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,050
amount of money for me that would be

1401
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,050
fantastic

1402
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,700
thousand dollars that would be pretty

1403
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,200
awesome but I haven't really seen it

1404
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,160
myself because I have a friend that was

1405
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:19,368
laid off couple years ago they tied it

1406
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,220
to an NB a severance package

1407
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:26,059
years ago this isn't even worth anything

1408
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:29,269
but the verbiage in the outgoing

1409
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:32,809
paperwork also said your severance

1410
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:36,939
package is tied to New York state

1411
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:39,470
unemployment which is highly illegal

1412
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:42,650
again I'm not a labor lawyer but yeah

1413
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:49,700
I'm not quite sure about that but I'm

1414
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:51,430
sure after this you have their employees

1415
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,029
together to try and manage the

1416
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,828
telecommunications yeah that would be

1417
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:57,920
awesome

1418
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:59,720
my employer does X Y Z and this first

1419
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:08,150
grade dude secre works with me and they

1420
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:11,598
agreed the only reason that's illegal in

1421
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:14,930
New Year economy was because New York

1422
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,509
state unemployment regulations say you

1423
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:20,269
can't receive money over a certain

1424
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:22,700
amount and the money would have been a

1425
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:25,399
little bit over which would have put him

1426
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:28,220
into legal jeopardy interview which say

1427
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:31,869
it was really popular sounds like a big

1428
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,868
reward for the lawyer

1429
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,400
if you like policy talks I'll be doing

1430
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,680
GTR talk at the Rochester Security

1431
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,210
Summit so that's how thoughtful - more

1432
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,950
than excited to see there it covers

1433
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:50,620
history including what was the last

1434
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:55,299
state of the colonies to join or ratify

1435
00:53:50,620 --> 00:54:00,240
the Constitution GDP our talk yeah deep

1436
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,240
cuts all right
