1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,969
thank you for your patience

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,370
I hope you guys enjoyed the keynote

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,378
upstairs I will point out that the stage

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,029
is really scary and I'm not gonna move a

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,220
lot because it's nice and I feel like

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,859
they fall so I'm sorry it'll be time

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,930
footing so I'm here this morning to talk

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,619
to you about cyber security and human

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,179
nature quick table contents how we're

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,820
going to go through it today a little

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,399
bit about me how I got here going

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,020
through how human nature affects your

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,000
cyber security some of the social

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,649
engineering techniques that I've seen

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,960
you've seen and how you can combat that

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,160
and then how your I teach need fits into

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,440
the mix so I actually have a political

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,529
science degree I worked on MTV for about

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,989
six years got my MBA and now I'm here

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,570
which is a roundabout way of getting

21
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,788
into cybersecurity but I was down in DC

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,300
when the SEC and had that changed all of

23
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,700
their regulations in 2015 and 2016 and I

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,798
needed to get all of my clients up to

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,490
their new regulations so I was still

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,439
learning about how technology and

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,039
cybersecurity affected the business as

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,419
well as the side of the regulations just

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,159
to start out I have a quick video clip

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,159
for you yes

31
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,439
anyway so we've all seen the movie catch

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,479
me again with Leonardo DiCaprio that is

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,428
bailing on a real-life person a thief

34
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,710
right now female and how he used his

35
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:44,110
charm and manipulation techniques to get

36
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,119
around society to defraud people and

37
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,640
cash checks I'm sure you see in the

38
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,640
movie so that is actually something

39
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,810
sorry

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,350
so maybe you can use to get your data as

41
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:11,440
well so I have a quick flip hopefully if

42
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:14,650
it wants to play me okay I will walk you

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,480
through the clip Leo DiCaprio flirts

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,790
with a bank teller to get her to show

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,590
him how the bank cash with a cheque so

46
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,640
he knows exactly what he needs to get

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,060
money bank without having had a real

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,920
check so do you know if your people

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,410
whoever runs the front desk whoever's in

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,670
charge of your student server room this

51
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,470
also requests people who just walked

52
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,950
into your office one of the biggest

53
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,269
social engineering techniques comes from

54
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,518
pretending to be who you're not so

55
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:45,100
someone shows up dressed as a spectrum

56
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,739
repairman or a horizon repairman or says

57
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,470
they're a lawyer since their CPA asking

58
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,400
for a whole bunch of information

59
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,200
human-interest going to tell us just to

60
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,959
let them do it especially people are

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,060
you know there's audit going on you try

62
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,560
to get help that's what we all do but

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,379
that's how people get into your systems

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,030
into your data and they can take

65
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:07,299
anything they want once they're inside

66
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,849
so if your receptionist has led a lawyer

67
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,130
into the building because he's working

68
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:15,040
on a case he can sit there and plug into

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,630
a wire report and get access to anything

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,010
you wants on your network and that's the

71
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,209
first part of social engineering that

72
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,518
catch me if you can really goes through

73
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,799
on the money side not the cybersecurity

74
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,650
side but it's very applicable today as

75
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,440
well and the next part of that goes into

76
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,790
social media social engineering I'm sure

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
all of you have seen the posts on

78
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,590
Facebook Instagram asking what's your

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,090
stripper name and it's asking work you

80
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,329
know what is your mother's maiden name

81
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,450
mixed with your first pet's name seems

82
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:45,760
innocent enough but those are the things

83
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,660
that are the security questions when

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,700
you're trying to raise a good password

85
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,739
so if a hacker can't get your password

86
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,260
they're gonna try to reset it that's how

87
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,660
they work if you're putting all of that

88
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,388
information out there with your security

89
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:03,430
questions they can get that without a

90
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:04,930
problem you're done so some things there

91
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,280
are ways to come back a little bit just

92
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,620
a little bit I really wanted to give you

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,290
guys actionable items on how to help

94
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,450
prevent these things so first and

95
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,060
foremost please encourage your users to

96
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,589
choose security answers that are baby

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,190
you can still pick the where to go on

98
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,108
your honeymoon

99
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,330
as a security answer to reset your

100
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,650
password but if you have pictures from

101
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,900
your

102
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,758
bora-bora on Facebook that are geotagged

103
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,489
anybody can go look at that

104
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,500
so maybe pick another city that is still

105
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,669
meaningful and you can remember but then

106
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,820
it's not going to give those hackers

107
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,770
that data point so pick where you were

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,509
born where you grew up where you went to

109
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,609
college where your last vacation was

110
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,110
pick anything that's not real you can

111
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,300
still use the answers that you're going

112
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,199
to remember but it's those data points

113
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,169
that help them get in a lot of security

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,039
question is also good finding answers a

115
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:54,448
common one that I speed when you're

116
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,969
resetting your password is what was the

117
00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:00,090
color of your first car how many colors

118
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,300
are there really ten blue white green

119
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,400
black tan it's not that many so if a

120
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,620
hacker is even guessing they only have

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,840
ten things to guess if you have to

122
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,150
choose those questions encourage your

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,669
users your colleagues your co-workers

124
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,198
again not a fake innocent per se you can

125
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,060
still choose a color but instead of

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,650
saying white you can say champagne or

127
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,810
snow like something that the hacker

128
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,429
isn't gonna guess because that gets us

129
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,310
to the other side of human nature and

130
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,320
how hackers see your network if you put

131
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,240
up a roadblock they're less likely to

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,710
get inside when you make things more

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,930
difficult people lose interest really

134
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,138
fast if you make it easy that's when

135
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,610
they keep going and that brings me to

136
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,190
the last one which is actually how I got

137
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:46,530
here today and how I met Tyler Whitley

138
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:49,229
and how all of this started I was at a

139
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,479
new th Association conference watching

140
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,010
Tyler's presentation and he does his

141
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,300
presentation is the exact opposite of

142
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,449
mine he does have happy to see the

143
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,449
network

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,570
so he'd shown three different security

145
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,670
postures for three different companies

146
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,260
there was a university a fortune 500 and

147
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,180
a mountaintop shop and it went through

148
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,650
all of the steps that they have done to

149
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,810
get into the network the penetration

150
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,539
testing so we'd ask the audience to go

151
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,490
to all three of these Famicon and I

152
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,750
raised my hand because I saw that none

153
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,210
of them had multi-factor authentication

154
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,790
enabled which would have stopped them at

155
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,169
step two you got a little bit mad at me

156
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,970
because I guess that ruined two slides

157
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,530
from further down in his presentation

158
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,700
but that's literally how I got here

159
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,150
today because multi-factor

160
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,979
authentication is a huge way to stop

161
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,510
them and it's not foolproof I'm sure

162
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,210
you've seen in the news you can't get

163
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,980
around multi-factor authentication but

164
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,510
it's making it harder for them and the

165
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,150
harder you can make it for them to get

166
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:54,870
it into your systems the easier they're

167
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:57,310
gonna give up unless but not least with

168
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,440
the older generations and the work

169
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,290
placement in schools they can't remember

170
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,320
their passwords and I get that but it's

171
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,600
up to you as the IT staff as a fellow

172
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,580
user to help them remember in a way that

173
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,010
somebody can't go pick up their keyboard

174
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,900
and get their password if you do have

175
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:18,610
multi-factor authentication enables then

176
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,440
again it's better yeah I've got a

177
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,340
perfect example for you I used to work

178
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:27,219
for a Tier one backbone the level 3

179
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,190
support person had the 10 passwords we

180
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,200
used under his keyboard I worked the

181
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,610
late shift

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,260
one day I needed to get into one of the

183
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,940
National routers I just walked over to

184
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:43,000
his desk I know and I should have done

185
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,460
it twenty-something years ago but that's

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,950
how easy it is and that's how widespread

187
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,950
that mistake is yeah and you think

188
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,200
even things like this it's not as done

189
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,840
as you think so remind people if you do

190
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,680
see that happening there are better ways

191
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,440
help them remember and that brings us to

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,300
fishing mostly the older generation

193
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,370
looking around the room right now I'm

194
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,980
pretty sure all of you would be ok with

195
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,330
a fishing scenario but the users have a

196
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,280
tendency to click on things that they

197
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,630
shouldn't one of my colleagues a few

198
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,760
weeks ago actually called me into his

199
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,490
office because he got an email from a

200
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,700
known competitor in our area and it was

201
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,960
something about a final bid but he knew

202
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,360
it was a specialist so he called me in

203
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
to check and I went through and all of

204
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,260
the links went to some sketchy website

205
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,020
Brazil it was clearly not a legitimate

206
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,809
email and that was great he was training

207
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,130
enough to be suspicious but at the end

208
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,849
like after we had come to that

209
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:44,450
conclusion his first response was I kind

210
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,880
of want to click in anyway just in case

211
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,650
curiosity will kill you can't plan for

212
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,600
that really in your cybersecurity plan

213
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,400
it's not a training thing it was clearly

214
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,770
trained you knew to ask me if it was

215
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,439
legit but he still wanted to click on it

216
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,970
so that's where we get into the culture

217
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,920
of your organization whether it's the

218
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,200
School of Business for your personal

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,219
life and health that can affect your

220
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,960
cyber security posture one of the things

221
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,360
that I recommend again actionable I

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,280
wanted to give actionable things is to

223
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,490
make cybersecurity part of your culture

224
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,520
a lot of users don't know how their

225
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,770
actions affect the company the IT staff

226
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,000
they have no idea how it affects your

227
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:29,610
compliance so if you're talking about

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,650
what happens next they're less likely to

229
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,750
give in to that curiosity so if our know

230
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,270
from accounting knew that clicking on

231
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,960
that email was going to cause the IT

232
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,639
staff doesn't matter how many of them to

233
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,589
have to work late that night

234
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,649
destroying backups if they know the

235
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:50,769
effect on people maybe they'd be less

236
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,269
likely to click on that curiosity is one

237
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,749
thing but knowing how it affects other

238
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,789
people

239
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:57,989
that's a very different thing and having

240
00:09:54,789 --> 00:10:00,339
that in your culture should hopefully

241
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:04,749
help to have people to not click on

242
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:07,989
things users also don't tend to know or

243
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:10,329
understand or honestly even care how

244
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:12,220
their behavior affects the whole

245
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,189
business whether it's a small

246
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,139
mom-and-pop shop or a bigger business so

247
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:19,329
one of my clients done in DC a few years

248
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:21,819
ago they were a financial firm they

249
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,339
needed to be SEC compliant so they hired

250
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:28,659
a new analyst as they did often and she

251
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:30,879
called him one day in ativy she she was

252
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:34,089
sending a lot of emails but her scent

253
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,349
box was empty so she thought there was

254
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,999
some client she was working with she

255
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:38,589
needed to check something from her sent

256
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:41,079
item his box and there's nothing there

257
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,299
so according her it was an emergency and

258
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,159
indeed it was an emergency but not for

259
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:46,899
the reason she thought it was I actually

260
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,009
had to hang up on her and her freaked

261
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,989
out so that I could call their

262
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,189
compliance officer I could start doing

263
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:53,199
the forensics I could straight

264
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:56,228
documenting all the timelines the

265
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:59,378
details the symptoms we didn't know how

266
00:10:56,229 --> 00:11:01,419
bad it was yet she had no idea she just

267
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,759
thought oh my god I can't get to my data

268
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:05,589
so after luckily there was no actual

269
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,079
reach no data was transmitted or

270
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:11,769
accessed she had ended up clicking on an

271
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,599
email to change her password gave the

272
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:16,419
malicious after her credentials

273
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,159
she logged in via Ella and he was he set

274
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,939
up in her inbox to delete everything

275
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,950
from

276
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,510
and deleted items to cover the fact that

277
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,020
he was sending out phishing emails and

278
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,290
asked her so luckily no breach happened

279
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,090
but she had absolutely no idea what she

280
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,459
just triggered so it was two days where

281
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,740
her compliance officer had to do things

282
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,710
my engineers having to do things we had

283
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,480
him to sign off on it the sec saying yes

284
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,270
this happened no data was transmitted

285
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,530
but she had no idea so if she knew all

286
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,970
of those things ahead of time if that

287
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,400
was in the culture when she was brought

288
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,670
on on you know how your actions affect

289
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,800
the business maybe she would have been a

290
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,060
little more careful there could have

291
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,050
been even a fine

292
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,849
in especially financial companies the

293
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,770
fines could have been enormous what she

294
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,540
had done it had given away enough

295
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,860
information that company could have gone

296
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,040
under like fines can be into the

297
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,930
billions but she had no idea so building

298
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,290
that into your culture is a great way

299
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,479
that you can help protect yourself your

300
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,880
company your schools so that people are

301
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
just a little bit more aware but where

302
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:27,640
does this begin more than just doing

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:29,469
what a phishing email is and that brings

304
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,199
us to NIST just a little bit on the

305
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,320
framework side it's really overwhelming

306
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,020
to figure out where to start with your

307
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,460
cybersecurity practice and this locally

308
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,170
has a framework already that you can

309
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,450
work with I'm not going to get into the

310
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,920
nitty-gritty

311
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,830
presentation but it does address the

312
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,240
human aspect of cybersecurity and give

313
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,370
you a framework to work with to build

314
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,310
that up so if you're not familiar with

315
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,020
it look it up it's widespread it's

316
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,160
online you can go through how it affects

317
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,110
you

318
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,579
but it's the communication of the people

319
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,840
that they're really focused on because

320
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,640
they get that it's not just the

321
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,860
technology you have the tools they use

322
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,780
it for people and how they use them and

323
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,460
how where they are your surroundings

324
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:14,380
really going on and that brings me to my

325
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,930
last point because passwords and

326
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,090
security questions and social

327
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:23,800
engineering is just part of it another

328
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:28,780
huge aspect of cyber security and the

329
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,510
human aspect of cyber security is we

330
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,600
don't know that attacks breach and that

331
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,540
was caused by one guy not installing a

332
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,210
patch on the web even though it was

333
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,610
there just didn't do it and that is what

334
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,760
cost Equifax breach millions of dollars

335
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,760
millions of people affected one guy not

336
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,870
installing patch so why would that guy

337
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,180
not don't patch it's the same reason

338
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,150
that all of us Joe run the updates on

339
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,959
our computers don't do the firmware

340
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,449
updates

341
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,640
it takes time there's also no downtime

342
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,680
and if you're in a business setting you

343
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,360
also have people donated for that

344
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,209
downtime so if you're the CFO

345
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,040
complaining about being down every time

346
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:13,800
update on your firewall even a

347
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,910
prioritize given it under firewall

348
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,779
probably not you're going to get yoga

349
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,610
and that ties back into the culture of

350
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,279
cybersecurity but not able to

351
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,990
cybersecurity because it's normal normal

352
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,269
maintenance and you all probably

353
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,160
understand how important that is but

354
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,779
most users don't most executives don't

355
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,689
and that's where everything it tends to

356
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:39,029
fall down so again I wanted some

357
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:42,670
actionable enemies for us so that you

358
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:45,220
could go through and have something to

359
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,110
make it better so building in scheduled

360
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,939
downtime is very important and I hope oh

361
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,949
you already have that it seems like a

362
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:52,179
basic thing but so does not write in

363
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:55,029
your password on coaster channel so I

364
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,259
have to say build in April downtime that

365
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,999
should not be coming from the IT

366
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,910
department this should be coming as a

367
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:02,860
company policy the IT department already

368
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,709
catches flack for things all the time

369
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,480
it's not their job to tell your entire

370
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:10,029
company we have to go down for two hours

371
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,040
where I can install updates it should be

372
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,319
a company policy coming to top down and

373
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,569
it is scheduled and communicated that

374
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,040
also gets rid of some of the

375
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,269
inconvenience like if you know it's

376
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,490
going to be down Thursday night from

377
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:23,139
8:00 to 10:00 you can play around that

378
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,000
like there's no reason you need to do

379
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:27,780
things

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,650
10 so if it's communicated company-wide

381
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:34,260
you're expecting it it's a lot different

382
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,030
than when you know you get an email that

383
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,340
you guys think sorry it Mel's going to

384
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,199
be down for two hours at consolidate so

385
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,180
plan ahead it'll make people happier and

386
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:47,700
then the updates can get in-store lot

387
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,410
easier your IT staff needs support a lot

388
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,730
of you are probably on the IT staff so

389
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,319
you probably know this 8 and 10 on a

390
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,030
Thursday night is not normal business

391
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,070
hours that means somebody working late

392
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,660
to do those things they have to be there

393
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,830
to do it test it make sure everything's

394
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,040
up and running and then if it goes badly

395
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,030
it's probably going to be after 10:00

396
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,189
are they still going to be at work the

397
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,810
next day at nine am are they going to be

398
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,670
giving a little leeway so they can stay

399
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,310
home and actually get some sleep because

400
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,170
they were up until 2:00 fixing this make

401
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,089
sure you take care of the IT staff their

402
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,370
jobs are important and nobody realizes

403
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,290
how much extra work just to make sure

404
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,610
you're up and running and if you aren't

405
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,959
really actually tough you're probably

406
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,970
agreeing you don't know how to do this

407
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,070
but I can send this to your professors

408
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,160
Joe and tell them same thing everybody

409
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,720
you sleep everybody needs a break and if

410
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,069
you're working late to do all these

411
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,810
updates you're missing out on family

412
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,300
time you're missing on your hobbies

413
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,160
it's a lot and I teach that who needs

414
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,430
the support behind them before anything

415
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,469
is actually gonna work properly and then

416
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,670
finding what didn't mean for the company

417
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,850
again you just don't know if they don't

418
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,949
care it's actually it's not their job

419
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:59,490
the accounting people the marketing

420
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:03,770
people they don't care until you

421
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:06,449
and what that means for the company so

422
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,240
an analogy that I like is changing the

423
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,439
oil in your car you change goes on your

424
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,319
car every 3,000 miles

425
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,819
because it makes it run more efficiently

426
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,250
it doesn't necessarily mean that your

427
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,449
car was running rapidly but you know

428
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,429
that you have to do it it's a normal

429
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,900
maintenance item so if you explain out

430
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,750
to your users in a similar way

431
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,550
you know the equipment needs to be

432
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,500
updated kind of like your car gets oil

433
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,899
change that doesn't mean it's down right

434
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,670
now doesn't mean anything's wrong it

435
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,980
just means it has to happen to continue

436
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:39,179
to work in well work even with a house

437
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,160
it doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong

438
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,290
right now what you want to prevent that

439
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,540
so it's an understanding of the culture

440
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,170
of cybersecurity that will make your

441
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:52,678
life easier and allow you to do what we

442
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:56,640
need to do I actually saw again the

443
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,490
client on TV her farewell oh one of my

444
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,440
clients Barrett they worked in politics

445
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,350
it's DCF everybody works in politics and

446
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,230
we had scheduled maintenance windows for

447
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,330
most firm insurance plans once a month

448
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,660
once every two weeks to end any plan so

449
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:18,030
it was June 2016 right before the

450
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:21,179
election and they couldn't afford to be

451
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,550
down during election season two weeks

452
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,520
later we saw all of the alerts that

453
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,050
their Chancellor was they had because

454
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,340
they hadn't installed firmware update

455
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,780
that was released for their firewall

456
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,780
because they'd skip to their nominee

457
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,280
expiry none of those things made sense

458
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,790
in their head at the time they reach

459
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,280
that but it sucks do you know this as an

460
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,920
IT

461
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,379
professional and see it affect your

462
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,820
clients because they just don't get it

463
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,850
where the person who's making the call

464
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,429
didn't get it some of them probably did

465
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,770
until you know they're hit there's very

466
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,110
little you can do them for that you need

467
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,970
to be very proactive with it so I'm

468
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:01,899
hoping that explaining it in a way that

469
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:04,090
makes sense to every man every day we'll

470
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,840
make it so that nobody would ever skip

471
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:11,439
through normal maintenance periods so

472
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,439
just a summary the actionable items that

473
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,560
hopefully you can do to combat the human

474
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,960
nature problem of cyber security if

475
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,610
users ways to get out of these simple

476
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,780
security answers questions passwords

477
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,689
everyone needs ideas for this prevent

478
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,160
them they might think it's funny

479
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,710
they might just laugh you off but it

480
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,510
lists in the back of their head put

481
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,360
multi-factor authentication and anything

482
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,200
and everything

483
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,629
since sensitive data all of these

484
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,400
breaches not all many of these breaches

485
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,100
can be prevented if you've got that

486
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,170
other layer of security because it holds

487
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,060
them if it's a lot more difficult and

488
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,220
I'm sure all of you have been in the

489
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,450
exact same position where it's new

490
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,150
something gets hard you don't want to do

491
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,090
anymore make it hard for the hackers you

492
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:05,360
will be favoring the culture of

493
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,490
cybersecurity that's not everybody in

494
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,770
this room not just people who are high

495
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,770
up you can talk about this especially if

496
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,860
you're an IT make people aware you know

497
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,990
the things they don't talk about it

498
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,909
don't you judgmental about it just get

499
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,660
it out there get everybody thinking in a

500
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:27,110
way of I could prevent this I am

501
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,060
important to us and that goes to every

502
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,610
every person make sure every person is a

503
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,970
part of this from the sea level down to

504
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,590
the interns are interning personally I

505
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,570
remember when she first started and she

506
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,620
was trying to help get I don't know one

507
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,919
of our marketing campaigns for

508
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:46,040
cybersecurity going she had no idea that

509
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,930
she's back up her computer absolutely no

510
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,570
idea and that's fine she's a student she

511
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:53,180
probably doesn't have to but those are

512
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,030
the ways that people think they don't

513
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,700
realize how it affects anything so

514
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,740
everybody in your organization should be

515
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,630
aware and knowledgeable and feel

516
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,220
comfortable asking questions it's okay

517
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,750
to ask questions questions are a whole

518
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,880
lot better than just clicking on things

519
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:13,390
and finally it's a pretty edgy stuff if

520
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,310
you don't control we do or our IT staff

521
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,680
but they need to know that they're

522
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,810
valued they need to turn off and they

523
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,070
need to be fresh and ready to go I have

524
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,070
their half asleep

525
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:34,389
that's all I have three right now then

526
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:34,389
if I have questions or stories

527
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,369
[Music]

528
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,440
so there's two sides to that one of the

529
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,480
actual products so fish me know before

530
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,520
very popular products for security

531
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,530
awareness training and they do a good

532
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,650
job on the fishing and the fishing and

533
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:08,310
the testing but it still focuses more on

534
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,380
the technical and you know don't click

535
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,570
on this because xyc don't answer this

536
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,790
because XYZ and that's why I wanted to

537
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,639
focus a lot on the culture also because

538
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:21,060
watching a video how many of us actually

539
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,100
watched those videos it's a lot better

540
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,690
if you're talking about it internally

541
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,379
and they understand how it affects

542
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,900
people I feel like that's where it hits

543
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,390
home because you clicked on an email

544
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,490
today and she couldn't go home for

545
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,620
another eight hours she's not gonna be

546
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,360
very happy but you're not necessarily

547
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,909
gonna have any idea because you're not

548
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,800
in the same department so talking about

549
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,800
how it affects the other people around

550
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,770
and what it really means I have found to

551
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,000
be a lot better than just those paid

552
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,000
trainings for you

553
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:05,630
quarterly monthly minimum monthly and

554
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:08,900
then at least no before which is the

555
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,790
ones that I use in love they allow you

556
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,560
to put people who have clicked into

557
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,510
different groups so that they get tested

558
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,000
more often but you also don't want to

559
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:19,340
annoy people like users and the

560
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:28,960
convenience of it and all of that is

561
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:28,959
just as important but if you don't I

562
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,080
have not seen a company fire somebody

563
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,760
overcooking a phishing email but at

564
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,919
least to know before it you set that up

565
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,740
automatically when you go through the

566
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,870
initial configuration so that if this

567
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,120
then that so it clicked twice in six

568
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,620
months then you get this level of

569
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,330
training and there's different levels of

570
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,969
training within this tool as well it's a

571
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,379
great tool and they recommend but you

572
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,060
can decide all that upfront and of

573
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,770
course you get the reports so we always

574
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,830
recommend showing your reports to the

575
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,200
c-suite that way they see a the progress

576
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,210
of most people and they also see all the

577
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,440
people who are still clicking because

578
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,420
then you might want to take it offline

579
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:38,900
out of that tool and do an in-person

580
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:40,820
training to talk to them about it how do

581
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,150
you feel about products like have I been

582
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:46,250
phones I haven't subscribed to the

583
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,470
notifications for the domain for the

584
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,390
school where I work and I get them but

585
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,580
it not a hundred percent sure what to do

586
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,290
with the data once I have it that's a

587
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,210
great question and a lot of people feel

588
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,060
that way with any juice whether it's

589
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,400
haven't been found its image tool even

590
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,740
if it's just a monitoring alert for disk

591
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:07,070
space not knowing what to do with the

592
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,800
alerts and half the problem and for that

593
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,490
one in particular it depends on where

594
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,629
it's coming from

595
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,280
everything is always going to be an

596
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,320
independence but I feel like there are

597
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,480
probably some online classes to you can

598
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,610
look at and I'll walk you through why

599
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,590
you're getting red alert and that's part

600
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,419
of being a cyber security professional I

601
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,889
think you need to kind of understand

602
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,900
where all

603
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,240
coming from before you an educated

604
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,650
decision on what to do about it and

605
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,470
that's where you know companies like

606
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,600
mine and grey castle also come in so

607
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,980
that we can help you do that I just a

608
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,928
lot of people don't have the internal

609
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,090
resources to go through all of those

610
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:41,610
things we understand that so if a group

611
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,080
has managed services to help with that

612
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,030
many other companies in the area to do

613
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,809
it does not necessarily need to just be

614
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,340
on you but training and learning and

615
00:25:49,809 --> 00:26:08,500
knowing what that means as a part of

616
00:25:51,340 --> 00:26:09,428
cybersecurity they do welding is very

617
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,669
annoying as a cyber security

618
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:16,150
professional and that again comes into

619
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:21,220
you how you explain the situation to the

620
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,780
c-suite it's that's when it gets to be a

621
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,250
personal thing like you need to have the

622
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,230
right person talking to them to make

623
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,210
them understand it and they are also

624
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,309
included in all deficient tests and we

625
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,540
have a whaling group as well because

626
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,240
they're usually targeted in a very

627
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,370
different way but I will say that again

628
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,230
it's a personal touch that you need to

629
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,639
have and not necessarily view maybe

630
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,770
there's someone else on your team they

631
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,240
listen to and can explain it better but

632
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,740
getting through to the c-suite

633
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,110
especially if they're a certain

634
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:52,450
generation okay I'm sorry I'm unfamiliar

635
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,760
with the term whaling the shirts that go

636
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,640
after only the big guns so they're going

637
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,110
after the CEOs the CFO's presidents they

638
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,450
check LinkedIn and things for those

639
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:05,820
titles and they charge em very very

640
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,820
specifically so that again thing

641
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,950
yeah

642
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,330
so I think I would want to set down

643
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,230
how

644
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,800
yes you are

645
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:51,330
so I have two different related answers

646
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,320
the most success that I've had and

647
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,740
talking to the c-suite

648
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,019
is relating it back to business so being

649
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,220
in a technology company and I work for

650
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,470
technology companies on my life

651
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,570
especially in New York State now with

652
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,110
the new regulations from DFS they came

653
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:09,750
out every third party that touches data

654
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,939
from a financial insurance institution

655
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,010
needs to be just the compliant so

656
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,529
explaining in a way that it affects the

657
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,850
business like if you told them we can't

658
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,380
do business with banks anymore you don't

659
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,590
do this like you're not compliant you

660
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,059
need to be that is one way that it tends

661
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,350
to resonate with them because those

662
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,658
hierarchs just care about money they

663
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,850
literally don't care about anything else

664
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,889
most of the time so if you can relate

665
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,870
the effects back to how it would

666
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:35,879
negatively impact the business as you

667
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,620
know a lot of success with that and then

668
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,179
multi-factor authentication they can

669
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,350
have whatever becomes what they want if

670
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,500
there's another layer of protection on

671
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,500
there

672
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:56,070
okay questioner there's a relatively

673
00:28:51,419 --> 00:29:00,570
well-known xkcd comic battery staple

674
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,799
port yeah you know the one okay as a

675
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,689
security professional what's your

676
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:16,709
opinion on that suggestion that's made

677
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:20,989
in that comic so pest phrases are

678
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:24,509
definitely recommended over a password

679
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:26,759
but the the comics suggested a

680
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:31,440
particular phrase which was basically

681
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:32,700
all lowercase letters so the number of

682
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,099
character the number of potential

683
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,509
characters in each slot was fewer even

684
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:38,339
though the character range was longer

685
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:45,479
how do you feel about that it's what I

686
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:47,849
was gonna get numbers but the point of

687
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:50,219
that particular comment was it wasn't

688
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,418
long enough that any algorithm there

689
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:53,249
going through any script that they're

690
00:29:51,419 --> 00:30:10,379
running would take so long to figure it

691
00:29:53,249 --> 00:30:12,659
out I know the math one very much know

692
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:15,748
the math actually no I was wondering

693
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:18,539
more along the lines of okay so I work I

694
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:20,309
work for a school literally a week from

695
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:25,469
Tuesday we're doing security training

696
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:26,849
session it's an outside because as one

697
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:30,269
person once told me you're never saved

698
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:32,269
in your own village so there's an

699
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:34,739
outsider coming in to give the spiel but

700
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:39,089
when I then have to carry the torch the

701
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:41,070
following year one of the things that

702
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:42,479
I'll say is you know make make the

703
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,009
passwords longer and they're gonna say

704
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:48,119
oh but they're so hard to remember as it

705
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:51,599
is so reducing the simplicity at a human

706
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,978
brain level of it's it's just a word you

707
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,000
know I'm thinking like rainbow table

708
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:57,920
attacks and things like that

709
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,900
is there a trade-off there because the

710
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,400
math of it as you said you add a

711
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,830
character it gets exponentially harder

712
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,450
but that's a brute-force attack

713
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,159
assumption there are other assumptions

714
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:47,720
that can be made by the attackers such

715
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:50,420
as your going but if I know that you're

716
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,790
recommending words like most of us know

717
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,800
and use on a daily basis only a few

718
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:57,379
thousand words let's say ten thousand

719
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,330
for an easy round number I think that

720
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,490
numbers actually kind of high but let's

721
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,600
say ten thousand and you know that the

722
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,600
average person is only gonna remember

723
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,850
three or four words so you've got ten

724
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,250
thousand characters so to speak at a

725
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:14,209
three character long password the math

726
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:15,770
comes out kind of you know once you view

727
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,020
it that way the math is very different

728
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:21,530
in terms of number of potential guesses

729
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:24,410
so I feel like there are ways to even

730
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:28,610
encourage them to use words that are not

731
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:31,790
a sentence same with how I mentioned is

732
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,090
that white snowflake so the words that

733
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,290
they know relate them to other

734
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,870
there are longer words more different

735
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,730
words I I can see an exercise in that

736
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,679
with you in your school just going

737
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,780
through it this is the password if you

738
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,300
want this is what we can change it to

739
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:49,800
you have it make it stronger password

740
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,800
but you'll still remember

741
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:59,569
[Music]

742
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:14,270
or his name what we work there was

743
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,389
work

744
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:29,609
but what one is cold so this is what

745
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:36,168
helped him like that first consonant in

746
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:36,168
the work is always the second letter

747
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,470
[Music]

748
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:04,709
[Music]

749
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,589
there are definitely tricks and

750
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,259
encouragement and ideas that you can

751
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:17,000
give your users to fix those things and

752
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,710
then if you are the person who decides

753
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,810
on the actual policy like with in Active

754
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,089
Directory you can also change your

755
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,429
policy to require a minimum length and

756
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:28,460
keep changing a certain amount of days

757
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,200
that is going to be a company decision

758
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,800
not your decision but there are ways to

759
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,799
enforce them

760
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,899
there have been a lot of things in the

761
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,270
news about that recently with Google and

762
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:50,149
their physical tokens any multi-factor

763
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,190
authentication is better than whether

764
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,138
it's a physical token which code and SMS

765
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,320
message phone call pick one and go with

766
00:34:54,139 --> 00:35:00,920
it and a lot of tools will allow you to

767
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,950
do a multitude of them so duo is my

768
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,290
personal favorite that we use you can

769
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,509
choose to do an SMS code and then a push

770
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,670
code for phone call and then another

771
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,700
code so it's not even just a second

772
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,470
player into two but you can choose that

773
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,330
when you're configuring it and the

774
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,250
physical token has also been in there a

775
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,880
lot of people who are comfortable with a

776
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:25,599
physical token they work just as easily

777
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,599
as the rest of them

778
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,200
honestly I've found it's easy to get

779
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:31,910
people to use the physical tokens if

780
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,359
they're technophiles they they feel like

781
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,009
it's a badge of honor I got my my

782
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,569
district superintendent using one just

783
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:45,230
because he's a technophile really mister

784
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,260
No

785
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:56,119
thank you

786
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:56,119
