53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
we are a non-profit association so this

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
confidence is not run uh by company we

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
don't do business out of that but we

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
have to pay this room we have to pay a

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
bunch of things

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
uh i mean it's not easy to get sponsor

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
when you are an acre conference no i

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,239
mean we don't we don't sell products

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
here we don't have vendors so it's not

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
as easy as could be like in other

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,519
conferences where

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,920
uh it's more like commercial so uh we

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
did a lot of i think good job so for

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160

is to share knowledge in the security

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,519

friends are from russia that run zero

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
night one of the probably largest aching

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,240
conference in

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
in russia so pretty happy to bring noah

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
as part of his community

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
okay so let me tell you about the

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
ingredients so what's known about soviet

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
came about three years ago so we decided

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
to run an international conference in

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,479
italy and everybody was telling us okay

129
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
dude you're in italy everybody speak it

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
here italian how come you you know

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
you're able to run something like this

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,919
okay let's let's give it a try so so we

133
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,199
went for that

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
and apparently seems to work uh

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
probably 10 years ago one i mean

136
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
probably the time we're not ready but

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
now i think it's good time to do

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,560
something like that

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
uh so it's the spirits are an

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
international conference in italy uh a

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,960
conference which has some novelty so we

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
don't want to have talks that you can

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
watch online on youtube right i mean

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
what's the point so we want to uh we

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,440
have the kofu people process and also we

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
try to invite speakers that

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
bring some novelty right so i'm not

148
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
saying he's 100 research oriented this

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
could be an academic conference but at

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,919
least there should be some more of

151
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,919
what's already there i mean some some

152
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,880
some novelty on top of everything uh of

153
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
course we are trying to be as vendor

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
neutral as possible so we have sponsor

155
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,720
asking us can we give a uh

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
you know event talk like a vendor pitch

157
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
no man that's you know we are not rsa

158
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
right even if that's right we don't want

159
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,319
to have like uh

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
logos of sponsor and so on and so forth

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,880
and we don't want to be influenced by

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
by sponsors we need sponsor of course so

163
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
it's always compromised but we try to be

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,039
as vendor neutral as possible

165
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,560
and of course the conference run on a

166
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
voluntary effort so we have as i said we

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
have this year 12 plus 15 27 people that

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,680
are helping us run this event just for

169
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
for pressure right

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,919
uh about the name everybody was asking

171
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,759
me okay why you came up with this no hat

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,000
thing uh yeah we couldn't call us

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
blackhead because you know we are not in

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
vegas so uh

175
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,400
of course you know

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
most of you guys know that there is

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
already blackhead and we don't want to

178
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,240
be

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
a cop blackhead we could call us

180
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
whitehead but doesn't sound very good so

181
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,880
we came up with no ad uh with something

182
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
in between but it's actually a logic and

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
i gave a talk

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
uh two years ago uh

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,759
as introduction to this conference uh

186
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,479
you can watch it on our youtube channel

187
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,919
uh where i i uh yeah i'm revealing

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,240
actually the uh the

189
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
uh the idea behind our name so go and

190
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
take a look at that talk

191
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
uh so our menu for today uh so we start

192
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
in the morning since you have a fresh

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,560
mind hopefully if you didn't

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,639
party too much yesterday night so we

195
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,039
start with a very

196
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
uh serious and technical uh

197
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
program

198
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
because we have like my talk then we'll

199
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
be david and then we have three talks of

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
around we have probably four talks in

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,400
the morning we're all in the track of

202
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
offensive and vulnerability research

203
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,319
so we look at binary analysis we look at

204
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
fuzzing we look at how to find like zero

205
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
days new vulnerabilities in software

206
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,240
then in the afternoon we

207
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
go with more broad topics so we have

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,039
talks in the scope of cyber espionage

209
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,560
which is very interesting top in my

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
opinion

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,319
hardware security so how you bypass

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
protection on hardware

213
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,800
chipsets uh when you look at malware and

214
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
ics and 5g so it's probably more

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
heterogeneous uh

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
program compared to the morning and then

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,759
of course we go as i said to uh to a

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
local pub nearby here

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
um

220
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,680
where you are all invite uh we will give

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
a voucher uh to to have a free drink

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
and then we see how it goes but we go

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
basically directly from here i will give

224
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
you instructions in the afternoon

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
uh so we we are aiming to have nine

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
talks in a day on a single track which

227
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
is something insane uh

228
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
but yeah we i mean we want to

229
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,919
burn our brain so that's why we are here

230
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,559
um and also the break is pretty

231
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,880
short in time so we have allocated one

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
hour and 50 minutes

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
and you know uh

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,720
to have you all you guys 400 people

235
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
taking a

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
a lunch in one hour not easy so what we

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,399
did we already

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
we contacted seven restaurant in the

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
area and they are waiting for us so we

240
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
already know that we are going there to

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
eat uh the the model is the fifo model

242
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
first in first out so you have to call

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
them

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,399
before 11 a.m and reserve a table there

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
is for some of them there is already

246
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,839
menu so you just go there and you eat

247
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,440
what we bring you basically for hours

248
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
there is some choice but it's made in a

249
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
way that you can eat in one hour um

250
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
i guess in the in the bag you have

251
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
received there is a uh the list of the

252
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
restaurant it's also on the website

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
so now at delta t the restaurants there

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
coffee place on the right but if you eat

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
i mean if you read on your own then you

261
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
might be late i mean this is what we

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
have seen two years ago in 2019 people

263
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
were late because they went late for

264
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,640
lunch

265
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,360
for the speakers we all go uh and also

266
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200

269
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
okay so uh

270
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
i don't want to take too much because

271
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440

272
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,110
