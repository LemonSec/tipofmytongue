1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,260
uh

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,500
[Music]

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:21,039
[Music]

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,039
me

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,960
[Music]

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
okay thank you

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,320
uh okay

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
there okay

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
so first of all

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,040
that the introduction was perfect

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,879
because as as he just mentioned a second

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,760
ago

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
yeah you're gonna see that this is

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
barely scratching the surface like most

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
of the things that you that the examples

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
that i'm going to share right now are

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,079
going to be fairly simplistic i think

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,600
that you can go back to your house

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
basically open the browser and almost

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
find what you're going to see but still

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
there there's some interest from actors

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
so

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
that's a good introduction to the topic

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,440
but also to be on the same line i want

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,959
to mention what we're going to be

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,360
talking about right now is uh

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
i'm going to be giving examples sharing

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
some of the stories from my third

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
intelligence team and i would i want to

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,320
share some of the cases that we see what

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
is it that the actors are doing some of

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
the interesting things they are doing

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,439
and some of the funny ones that have

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,960
made absolutely no sense but they didn't

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,799
know obviously

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,119
um and yeah well that's how we we begin

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
with with this topic

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
uh for some background

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,759
just uh well i'm mexican i was working

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
in the u.s many years now i'm in

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,479
amsterdam moving all over the place uh

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
i'm currently leading the team for cyber

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,799
physical threat intelligence in mandiant

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,680
so

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
when i say cyber physical what it means

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,159
for those of you who know the concept

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,840
it's operational technology industrial

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,920
control systems anything that can have a

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
physical impact in the world whenever

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
you interact with this software right it

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,399
can be

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
something in a water facility it can be

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
something in energy facility it can be

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
in the car it can be in anything that

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
can have a physical implication and we

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
just gather information try to put up

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
the story and share it in such a way

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,920
that you know it might raise awareness

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,360
and help different organizations

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
i wanted to start strong with some

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
images that seemed you know like

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
impactful and i was just thinking okay

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
this case is very beautiful

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,239
in june

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
2020 i believe there were news about a

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,680
series of um explosions in in iran

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
and what they were saying is in the

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
beginning they said you know someone

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,879
actually came and implanted some

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
physical device and in a different

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
service what they would say is someone

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
actually did a cyber attack against blah

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,599
blah

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,360
and actually one of the impacted

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
services about impacted targets sorry

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,519
was natan's

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,080
for those of you that know of some ics

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,840
cyber security

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,000
natanz is the facility where stocks not

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
happen again stocksnet one of the few

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,680
pieces of cyber physical malware that

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
basically

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,640
delayed the the nuclear process

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,480
by destroying or damaging some of the

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
centrifuges that for for the production

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,599
of these nuclear facilities

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,720
i'm not going to get in that in that

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
case if you want it's archaeology but

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,000
really just google stuxnet it's a

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
stocksnet it's amazing but the point

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,080
here is we saw these explosions the news

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
started saying that and

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
whether it's true or it's not true it

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
doesn't matter because for some people

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,280
it was true

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
and as you might know now we get back to

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,640
the to this point

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,720
whatever happens in iran

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,799
immediately like publicly israel is

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,799
blamed whatever happens in israel

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,280
immediately publicly iran is blamed so

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,799
this is what happened here they said of

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
course it's israel i don't know and

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,799
who knows

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
but then we started looking into into

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
you know like like the forums different

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
forums where we check what the attackers

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
are doing and we found this

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
and what the attackers were saying is in

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
retaliation for the explosions in iran

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
we are going to go and blow up anything

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,680
we can in israel and where it's going to

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
be terrible and we're going to find all

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
of the devices that we want

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,239
and this is what they what they dropped

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,159
look we are terrible they shared some

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
videos showed us how they were playing

118
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
with this with these panels parenthesis

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
these panels control physical processes

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,918
but here goes the question first of all

121
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
have you ever seen a gas system or do

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,479
you know what a gas system is

123
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,479
even if it is something

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,440
you know

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
it sounds kind of sketchy right because

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
you know for for for handling any type

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,880
of gas oil and gas processes you need

128
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
many different systems so to begin with

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
who knows what this is

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
so we saw that and we decided let's go

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,199
and research right normally what we do

132
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
is go and figure out what is it that the

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
actor is actually seeing

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,639
and we went immediately to show that

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,840
those who don't know the service i'm

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
going to talk a bit more about that but

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
basically it's a

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,000
browser literally

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,960
www.showdown.com and there are a couple

140
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,199
similar browsers where you go and try to

141
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
find anything that is exposed to the

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,199
internet so if you know what to look for

143
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,960
you can find it you can find cameras you

144
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,840
can find tank uh we call it tan gorgeous

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
you can find uh i don't know any type of

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,000
processes as long as they are exposed

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,440
via internet into the ports you're

148
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
looking for services you're looking for

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
and what not

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
so anyway we went and looked and we

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
corroborated yeah there was no

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
authentication it was disabled so yeah

153
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,639
the actor definitely had access to this

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,880
uh we corroborated you know that image

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
is taken directly from jodan as well and

156
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,479
you know we started getting all the the

157
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,600
data

158
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
now the point here is the next question

159
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
for us like as

160
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
and on the analysis side we check like

161
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
what is this right well i mean it says

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
dumpers it's a sucked demand

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,199
there's something weird let's figure out

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,240
what it is

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
and then we actually figured out what it

166
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
is and it was

167
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
probably the actors didn't really know

168
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
what they were looking because the

169
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
retaliation was a bit poor

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,080
it was a kitchen system it was a kitchen

171
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,240
ventilation system yes in israel but you

172
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
know just the kitchen you know as

173
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
interesting as it can be

174
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,720
so

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
actually the image you see here is the

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
site where they used to have like the

177
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
actual kitchen and the system but you

178
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
know after everything happened and i

179
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
don't know or maybe they just changed

180
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
the product and they just now it's down

181
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,199
i should have saved it it's bad for but

182
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
but practice not to

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
but yeah so that is actually like the

184
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
big retaliation that these terrible

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
actors were actually doing uh trying to

186
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
destroy the world

187
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
and the interesting thing as well is at

188
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,160
least you know like to give them some

189
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
credit everything that you see in here

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
it does respond to very similar

191
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
technologies which is again kind of

192
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
scary right so they have similar types

193
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,639
of controllers sometimes they have

194
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
similar types of uh what we call human

195
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
machine interfaces which are like this

196
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,280
image you saw and sometimes they even

197
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
use the same products it just sometimes

198
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
not it depends you know goes from vendor

199
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
to vendor whatever but in the end you

200
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
know the the point is it's so easy to

201
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
find that it's also so difficult to know

202
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
what you're looking at and it can be

203
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,319
something very important or very

204
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,400
unimportant as in this case

205
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
i'm going to give more examples

206
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
but before going to examples i mean what

207
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
you're going to ask is yeah why is this

208
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,919
guy in front of us talking to us about

209
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,240
kitchens right i mean like yeah we we

210
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
don't care about hacking kitchens well

211
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
first i want to introduce you right like

212
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
like to to the trend and then we'll see

213
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,000
the other examples where this becomes a

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,680
bit more concerning

215
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,639
um

216
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,000
this this image that you see here is

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
something that i call the evolution of

218
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,759
cyber physical threats

219
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
and the point is normally when you think

220
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,000
about i don't know any type of malware

221
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
hacking computers whatever

222
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
the process started being something very

223
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
simple someone created this i don't know

224
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
this specific malware it has worm like

225
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
capabilities it goes everywhere then

226
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
someone says i do an antivirus i find it

227
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
you know it's always like you know i do

228
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
something more complex then i respond

229
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,120
complex defend complex defense

230
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
but in the case of cyber physical we

231
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,039
have exactly the opposite it seems that

232
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,759
we have some governments specifically

233
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
developing very complex techniques

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,479
and then as they continued to evolve

235
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,639
then more simple actors started finding

236
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,400
ways to get to this type of physical

237
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,199
systems so we started with of course

238
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
state sponsored like stocks net like

239
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,599
like triton like you know big cases and

240
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,039
then eventually we started seeing

241
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,120
recently the the financial actors so

242
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
basically the cases of ransomware that

243
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
you see oftentimes

244
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
well not oftentimes but at least in some

245
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
occasions have reached uh control

246
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
systems and you can tell by some

247
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
analysis on on on basically on the

248
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
malware samples

249
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,879
um

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
and and then we go even more simple

251
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
which is this case when you're talking

252
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
about activists or opportunist actors

253
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,680
right like for me a hacktivist

254
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
historically it has always been the one

255
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
that says i dump this database i place

256
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,080
this on your website and say you know

257
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
you're terrible you shouldn't be here

258
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
but now you're saying that what they're

259
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
trying to do is figuring out how can i

260
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
generate a different impact what if i go

261
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,640
and do something physical

262
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
and when you consider all the things

263
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
that are exposed all the physical things

264
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,040
that are exposed

265
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,279
then again it gets a bit scary

266
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
although you know not to exaggerate i'm

267
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,040
gonna be very careful to maintain the

268
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,080
nuance to what they can do or not

269
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
so this activity we refer to as low

270
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
sophistication compromises

271
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
and what what they're categorized for is

272
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,839
basically compromises in which normally

273
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
the actor is not you know it's not a

274
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,959
group it's not well resource it's not

275
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
like like or maybe a small group of

276
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
individuals but not like a criminal

277
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
group not a nation state nothing like

278
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,519
that

279
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,440
we're also referring to cases that most

280
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
often refer to just literally finding

281
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,120
internet connected assets and then

282
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,959
figuring out how to connect to them and

283
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,640
started moving so oftentimes they are

284
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
fairly simplistic and we're going to see

285
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
a bit more about those cases but it's

286
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
fairly simplistic

287
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,480
and oftentimes what the actors want is

288
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,920
either you know sometimes yeah they want

289
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
to sell they want to make money but

290
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
sometimes they just want

291
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
you know its reputation it's very funny

292
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
but for some reason

293
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
every time one of these actors posts

294
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
something in there the others seem to

295
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
think oh yeah he's really terrible he

296
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
hacked a gas system and then when you

297
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,720
actually analyze that you know what

298
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
actually really happens it might be more

299
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
simple but

300
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
they get that reputation that they want

301
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,279
and all of this is underground and

302
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,959
public forums you know just like all the

303
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,519
types of actors that we follow

304
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,880
and the reason why we started looking

305
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,160
into this activity and trying you know

306
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
like bringing it up to everyone is

307
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
because we realized that that the

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
numbers were kind of increasing this is

309
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
nothing new it has happened for a couple

310
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
years but eventually all of a sudden we

311
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
were seeing like you know that every

312
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,519
week our researchers had like these new

313
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,600
actors interested now they want to know

314
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
more now they are doing this now they

315
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,640
are doing that and that is when it

316
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
became interesting like why is there

317
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,959
subtly so many people interested

318
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
and and it's good because you learn

319
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
about security it's bad because what

320
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,760
could happen

321
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
so what you see in here in this diagram

322
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
oops

323
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
in this diagram is uh on the left side

324
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
it's difficult to see all the cases but

325
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
on the left side

326
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
what you find are public cases those are

327
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
uh examples where there was an advisory

328
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
from government where there was uh you

329
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
know someone denounced this to the

330
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,920
authority someone you know there was

331
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
something public

332
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,720
and the cases on the right are cases

333
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
that are not public that we are tracking

334
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
but that you know no one no one knows or

335
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
maybe just a victim if they even realize

336
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
that they were compromised or why weird

337
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,839
things were happening

338
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
in these cases there are different types

339
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
of activity as well some of them they

340
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
just go and look into what's what's

341
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
going on some of them expose a ton of

342
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
devices they say like hey look i found

343
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
all of these devices that you can go and

344
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
connect to so just go and do whatever

345
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
makes you have fun

346
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
some of them instead um go and interact

347
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,360
with the process those are the most

348
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
concerning because actually they don't

349
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
care and they they might not know what

350
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
they are doing but they can do it

351
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
and some of them share tutorials so that

352
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
you know if anyone else wants to go and

353
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
join the club then you can just do it

354
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
so well i'll probably skip this but

355
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
i already mentioned a bit the point why

356
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
do these guys do it reputation most of

357
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
the times they just want to be i don't

358
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
know they just want the other actors to

359
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,160
know that they can do it even though

360
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
it's not so complicated but since many

361
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
people don't know it and you're gonna

362
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
learn the secret right now you will be

363
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
able to do it as simple as all of them

364
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,279
but

365
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,200
the second type is money yeah oftentimes

366
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
they share it and they are trying to

367
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,839
monetize i don't know why because it

368
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,839
doesn't seem like they are selling much

369
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
but they go and try to monetize

370
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
and the other one is why not you know

371
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
the same reason why many of us are here

372
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
right it's just like i have a device in

373
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,279
front uh can i do something to it yeah

374
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,720
well let's do it right it's fun

375
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
so to categorize a bit this uh of all

376
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
what we see of these categories we

377
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
checked like a bit in underground forums

378
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,160
there are different places where you can

379
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
see these these attacks but in

380
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
underground forums at least uh we

381
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
categorize a bit of the numbers and it

382
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,399
turns out that yeah most people

383
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,680
definitely what they want to do is

384
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
figure out how to make money out of this

385
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,959
not surprising uh the least are doing

386
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
threats it's it's very interesting but

387
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,760
sometimes they're just like hey i'm

388
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
gonna go and blow up anything i can

389
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,519
nothing has happened like that normally

390
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
when they say it but they go and

391
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
they go and say it and then they drop

392
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
kitchens and stuff

393
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
um and yeah well so this is just like

394
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
like like an overview of

395
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
generic of the behavior of these actors

396
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
and to finish this part of the trends

397
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,440
i'm trying to go quickly through the

398
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,959
trend so i can give just more stories i

399
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,880
find them much more amusing

400
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
um

401
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,200
how do they get the control to its

402
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,639
processes so there are three simple

403
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,959
steps the first one i mean like most

404
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,399
often there are other other cases but

405
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
most often it's as simple as this the

406
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
first one just finding the favorite

407
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
search engine that you want uh there are

408
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,279
many uh fofa children since his binary

409
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,760
edge has capability any of those where

410
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,279
you can go and search for what is

411
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,120
internet connected if you know what to

412
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,279
search for again then you can go and

413
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,639
identify at least some examples to go

414
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,000
and play with

415
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,839
and uh sometimes sometimes you can even

416
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,440
do google google docking there are some

417
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
cases that that you're going to see here

418
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,399
that if you want to find an industrial

419
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,480
controller literally charlie just google

420
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
how to find an industrial controller and

421
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
there's some some queries that are

422
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
already done and you always find the

423
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
same ones online so it's like they've

424
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
never learned about it or oftentimes you

425
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
find i don't know

426
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
some of our consultants really enjoy

427
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
just going and finding uh industrial

428
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
controllers exposed and then just

429
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
reaching out figuring out who the the

430
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440
owner is because you know like just go

431
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,760
and play the detective you they reach

432
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
out to the owner and they're like hey

433
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,639
you know you own this small car wash but

434
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,920
you have this exposed i don't know how

435
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
you set it up but please fix it and they

436
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,440
just i don't know they just find it like

437
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,120
something very amazing

438
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,959
and then you choose you find what are

439
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,519
the panels that you're interested in uh

440
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,120
this case for example is something about

441
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,560
it it's like for air quality in a

442
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,720
building but you know we have found all

443
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
sorts of panels and

444
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,279
in the example you're gonna see more

445
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
and then finally click show off really

446
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
it's not difficult to to connect to one

447
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,680
of these uh you just use i don't know

448
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
some of them you can go to be a teams

449
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,199
viewer build via vnc connections via i

450
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
don't know like sometimes rdp it's not

451
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,760
really that that that you know any any

452
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
secret for for most of you guys that i

453
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
know that you do much more complicated

454
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
stuff

455
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
so this you know already the trend you

456
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
know what what are the actors what

457
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,320
they're doing what type of activity i'm

458
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
referring to we are talking about like

459
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,760
physical type of compromises that are

460
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
super simple that are just everyone is

461
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
doing them right now and well we want to

462
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
know what what are you talking about

463
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
like because we saw a kitchen but what

464
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,560
else can you find

465
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,079
so this is this is one of my favorites

466
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,120
this is from um

467
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,480
i'm going to say

468
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
beginning of 2021.

469
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
uh i i'm not sure this this reached to

470
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
europe it actually was a case from from

471
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
the us and it's in a place in a remote

472
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
place called oldsmar florida and in

473
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,639
ultimate florida the reason why we heard

474
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
about this case most often times we

475
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,240
wouldn't hear is because they went to

476
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,519
the authorities and then the authorities

477
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,040
went to the newspapers and then everyone

478
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
started figuring out what happened

479
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,040
and so what happened is the

480
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
basically all of a sudden you have the

481
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,639
operator you know that this person in

482
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,160
the plant that's sitting down in a water

483
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
facility just like checking that

484
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
everything is in order in those screens

485
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
like like the ones that i keep on

486
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,759
showing

487
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,959
and then all of a sudden the screen

488
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
starts moving and and the amount of

489
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
chemicals in the water it was uh sodium

490
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,639
hydroxide i believe

491
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,360
uh starts increasing like crazy so this

492
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,639
person immediately says like okay no

493
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,079
there's something weird i'm gonna fix it

494
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,759
they fix it and they you know like like

495
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
they send information

496
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,519
why is this important well

497
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
this is actually going to be very fun

498
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
but those two uh documents that you see

499
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,079
in there

500
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,839
uh they are my mother's work because

501
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,199
when she heard about this case she was

502
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
like she's a chemist

503
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
chemistry teacher at the university and

504
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
she was like i want to teach my students

505
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
and i want to make a problem and i want

506
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
to tell them this is the modification

507
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,639
that someone did in this water what

508
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
would happen to the human body if they

509
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,759
were to drink it

510
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,279
if you want to have nightmares go on

511
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,800
search in google and go and search what

512
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
happens when the ph of water is too high

513
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
and if you drink it and you can have

514
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
nightmares and they're horrible images

515
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
right you can imagine it just burns

516
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
burns your esophagus and destroys your

517
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,639
stomach entirely

518
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,279
um so yeah i mean that's new but

519
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,920
the point in here is the attack actually

520
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,839
you know that had that potential of

521
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,920
modifying a physical parameter that can

522
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,079
result in an individual being seriously

523
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,519
harmed

524
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,639
would that does that mean that it was

525
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,160
going to happen maybe not you know

526
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
because they're in an engineering

527
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
facility you would expect them to have

528
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
more safety measures and yes normally

529
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
they do so in this case there were

530
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
additional processes but still it showed

531
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
how easy it was for an individual

532
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
externally to get access to this team's

533
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
viewer via a compromise endpoint

534
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
and eventually you know just modify the

535
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
quality of the water that gets to your

536
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
house

537
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
again nothing that happened but you know

538
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,559
it's

539
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,520
um

540
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
so what we did with this was we went to

541
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
google docking as well we tried to find

542
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
more information uh we have reason to

543
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
believe that this is the panel and what

544
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,799
the the attacker actually saw no one

545
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,640
knows really but but the truth is just

546
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,359
that you know since companies on the

547
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,120
cyber physical side on operational

548
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,559
technologies were not

549
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440
have not really are much behind in

550
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
security they haven't thought about many

551
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,400
of the

552
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,919
of the things that we consider normal

553
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
for security so this panel actually was

554
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,559
present in in a vendors in a third-party

555
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,400
vendor that actually was announcing like

556
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
hey we did all this work for them we

557
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
designed this and we designed their hmis

558
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
and we designed that so we just found it

559
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
uh we realized that there they have that

560
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
measurement so very lucky it's that one

561
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
we notified them it is not it is now

562
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
down of course from the website and well

563
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
it just like like shows one of the of

564
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
the challenges on ulti security because

565
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
of course this is information you need

566
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
to make such an attack

567
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,320
now the second one if this is also

568
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,200
concerning i've begun with the

569
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,799
concerning ones and then they go more

570
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,120
simple uh the second concerning one was

571
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
was in israel precisely there was um a

572
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
notification an advisory from from their

573
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,520
security agency

574
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,039
i can't read that that's why i just

575
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
translated it there normally i wouldn't

576
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,559
add so much text but in case you were

577
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
curious basically what they were saying

578
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,400
is one day in the morning they just

579
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
issued this notification and said all

580
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
companies for water and energy in you

581
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,600
know in the region please uh

582
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
basically remove or protect your assets

583
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
that you have connected to internet

584
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,080
change your passwords and do a b c and d

585
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,160
as simple as that but the reason why

586
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
they were saying it is because something

587
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
actually happened apparently in

588
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
different water facilities they had

589
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
compromises

590
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
these compromises though were a bit more

591
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,480
complicated than the normal

592
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
you know like case where i say like

593
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
something is an internet and then you

594
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
know they just go and click they were on

595
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
internet yeah but what the actors

596
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
actually did we assumed similar actors

597
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
but but you know

598
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
there are many things to discuss in

599
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,960
there

600
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
this is actually what they did i'm

601
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,840
showing basically on minor techniques

602
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
which is kind of like like an easy way

603
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
to to translate what what was what the

604
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,400
actor did

605
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
um basically they modified

606
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
what we call the the control logic

607
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
to for those that are not familiar with

608
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,760
with control logic what it means is just

609
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
the language that that industrial

610
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,160
controller which is like a not so clever

611
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
computer that just you know sets input

612
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
manages inputs and outputs in a clever

613
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
way

614
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
um basically and it's handled by this

615
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,120
ladder logic that's what we call it in

616
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,360
control logic so basically the actors

617
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
actually removed this logic and modified

618
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
which means that they actually knew what

619
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,080
they were looking at they were looking

620
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
at industrial controllers they knew what

621
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
they were doing and they decided to

622
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
deliberately modify that and again that

623
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,039
is something that is controlling a

624
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
physical process physical in this case

625
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
again for water

626
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
it's no surprise that water facilities

627
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,960
often tend to be impacted by this

628
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,039
because i mean you can imagine how much

629
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,280
does water cost for you it's really low

630
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,080
right

631
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
or at least in most places well

632
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,880
basically where are you going to get

633
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
money for cyber security in energy if

634
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
they're they're going much further and

635
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
it's considered like critical and

636
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
whatever water even though it's much

637
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,280
more critical in most places it's

638
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,760
underfunded so normally they have teams

639
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
security teams that might have one or

640
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
two people maybe one of them is ot

641
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
security the other one is it and that's

642
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,600
as much you know like in oldsmar the

643
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
same guy that handled the entire network

644
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,919
had to handle the security so you know

645
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,760
it's no surprise that these things can

646
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,440
can happen and because they don't have

647
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
the money to go and pay like to the to

648
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
the big corporations to go and help on

649
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,760
these type of cases

650
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,120
so a third case activism

651
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,679
um this is actually tied to the past one

652
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,760
for those for that period of time during

653
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
i don't know like june july august in

654
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,640
that year um there was a ton of cases

655
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
that happened actually with israel

656
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
because again we see these actors that

657
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
they respond to something like in in you

658
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,760
know in the news or something in

659
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,919
geopolitical context and then they go

660
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,280
down and they say like hey okay we're

661
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,559
going to go and mess up with whatever we

662
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,280
can

663
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
and so in this case again another actor

664
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
that just went and released these

665
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,400
images again they were well the images

666
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
and the accesses that were specifically

667
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
well this is like a mining mining type

668
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
system i'm like for supporting mining uh

669
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,559
logistics uh the second one is for solar

670
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
panels again it's it's less critical

671
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
than the water for sure but it you know

672
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,159
it shows again like like type of what

673
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,000
the actors are trying to do and how they

674
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,679
are trying to translate this type of

675
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,480
activism behavior into the physical

676
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
world

677
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,760
another example because we have many

678
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,679
yes more actors prolific group okay

679
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,600
another group that one day they just

680
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
woke up and decided let's go and find

681
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
many of these panels so they found

682
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
hundreds and then they shared them then

683
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,960
we go we validate yes they exist we form

684
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
the companies they are all over the

685
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,159
world some of them important some of

686
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,840
them not we're not going to analyze one

687
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
by one but there were things like this

688
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
this could be as well from a facility

689
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,559
but this could also be as well like from

690
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,080
the pool in your home and this could be

691
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
as well from you know wherever so some

692
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
of them are very sensitive some of them

693
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,000
are not basically which is also one of

694
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,520
the reasons why it's so difficult to go

695
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,120
and filter what is the the impact

696
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
and some of them are doing their

697
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,360
homework

698
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,039
this is another case that's very

699
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,480
interesting because they claim that what

700
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
they want to do is raise awareness

701
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
no one knows who they are no we don't

702
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
know if it's research or not they don't

703
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
claim to be researched they just say we

704
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
want to raise awareness so they share

705
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,240
tutorials they say what they are doing

706
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,159
they say how they did it they share many

707
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,520
of these panels the two on the left

708
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,640
yeah follow your left is those two are

709
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,159
actually controllers and like like the

710
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,760
panels how you access the industrial

711
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,640
controller and the other two very funny

712
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
they just found this this panel that

713
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,080
seemed to be something about nuclear

714
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,000
facility probably it was all we don't

715
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
believe this was actually in use

716
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,320
uh but then what they decided is let's

717
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
go to the encyclopedia and let's find

718
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
some examples so they went to

719
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
encyclopedia and in their paper in the

720
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
research they they share you know like

721
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
hey this is what we did this is how it

722
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
looks like this is what it is for you

723
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
know and try to explain the process

724
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,159
it's not really rocket science but when

725
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,400
you analyze they are actually doing it

726
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
right what they are doing is trying to

727
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
learn about the process they are

728
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
compromising so that they can go and

729
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,480
generate the impact that they desire and

730
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,000
all of this is something if you realize

731
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
i haven't said anything that that anyone

732
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,159
in this room cannot do basically it is

733
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,080
fairly fairly fairly doable and mainly

734
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,840
with the super great skills that that

735
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
are concentrated in here

736
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
and the last example like like generic

737
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
example is uh this one is from a hotel

738
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,600
it's a major hotel in um

739
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,320
in an english-speaking country

740
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
and basically yeah the actors they got

741
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
access again they show a full video they

742
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
say this is what i'm doing at the hotel

743
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
this is what i'm doing they show how

744
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,120
they go and modify blah blah we don't

745
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,400
know if it happened like we're not going

746
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
to reach out to the hotel and say like

747
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
hey do you realize that something weird

748
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
happened with your showers but actually

749
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
you know that's what they were changing

750
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
like the temperatures and the gas or

751
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
whatever

752
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,679
now this is fine right i mean like it's

753
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,840
not that bad because every time i tell

754
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,159
you something i say it is fun but then

755
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,080
i'm telling you well i mean like nothing

756
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,320
happened so okay we're good even though

757
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
it seems kind of scary and also just

758
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
just for the record i did reach out to

759
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,000
the the the creator of this meme because

760
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
i wanted to make sure he was like he's

761
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
very sensitive on that so i did add his

762
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
name and everything casey green thank

763
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
you

764
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,200
um

765
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,559
but now let's go to the other you know

766
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,919
like like there's the other part like

767
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,600
the actors that don't really know what

768
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
they are doing i mean some of them know

769
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
and they are trying to do things but

770
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,559
let's see the fun side right like many

771
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,000
of them don't really don't really know

772
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,360
like the kitchen this is the same one

773
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,120
that you saw in the beginning

774
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
and

775
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,159
well i mean just another one that comes

776
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,799
out of my out of my head is uh there was

777
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,559
some actor that said we compromised

778
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,360
chinese train well chinese train system

779
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
and like okay well what is that and it

780
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,679
was a system that basically checks it's

781
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,919
an hr system to know how many people of

782
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,520
your crew you have to have on each of

783
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,600
the different um

784
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
of the different cars of the train i

785
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,880
didn't even know that was even necessary

786
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,640
but apparently it is and some people use

787
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,440
it

788
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,760
um but yeah so you can find all type of

789
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,960
things

790
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,880
and

791
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
um well i mean

792
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,880
a second example

793
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
uh okay also sorry i really love this

794
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
guy it just like it looks like so

795
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,640
threatening but it's not so i thought it

796
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,600
fit very well in there but anyway um

797
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,960
intelligence okay the second one

798
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,320
intelligence company this is one of my

799
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
favorites and it's not this this one is

800
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,840
not funny particularly it's actually a

801
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,600
very interesting legal void in the world

802
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,799
i don't know it's

803
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,960
this person which we know is a guy this

804
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,080
guy is latin american and in his country

805
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,279
well there's no no really good

806
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,039
regulation about this right so he can go

807
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
poking and dumping and anything that he

808
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
wants to do and no one says anything so

809
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
he created his own intelligent security

810
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,400
company and he sells his services and he

811
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,159
has the website and you can go you can

812
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
pay and basically what he sells is dumps

813
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,159
and

814
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,520
basically all of the information that he

815
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,120
steals

816
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,799
and normally

817
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,960
this person claims that that you know

818
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,799
they are actually compromising control

819
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,039
systems sometimes it's real i mean not

820
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,240
really compromising but they have some

821
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
of these like like hmis that we that he

822
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,880
has found and sent but sometimes it's

823
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,799
you know it's like a sql dump and then

824
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,159
it's like a database but it just has

825
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,320
energy so he says this is energy he has

826
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,919
nothing to do but you know it proves

827
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,080
again an actor that sort of knows doing

828
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
some things but doesn't know really what

829
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
he's getting into by saying ics so if

830
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
you know

831
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,640
you know already have the skills and

832
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
then know a bit of what you search on

833
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
the ics side let me tell you you are

834
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
already a couple steps

835
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,679
far ahead because you can go and find

836
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
amazing things that very few people have

837
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,360
looked at

838
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
and this is my favorite what happened

839
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
here is this actor basically what they

840
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
said is you know guys beware we have a

841
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,400
german

842
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
train or rail control system

843
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
and we looked at that and yeah i mean it

844
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
looked like i mean it looked like a

845
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
video game but but to be honest even

846
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,039
though it looks like a video game most

847
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,960
of the machine interfaces that they use

848
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
for industrial cases they look like

849
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
video games from the 80s so it could be

850
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
real right

851
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,240
and also if you have seen a train one

852
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,760
we've seen some because you know when

853
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,039
they leaked documents and whatever you

854
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,080
see more or less how they look and

855
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,039
whatnot

856
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,200
um well this one

857
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,279
we did reverse image lookup really not

858
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
that complicated and we realized that it

859
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,760
was for trained model sets so basically

860
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,440
what this guy was was threatening it was

861
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,120
just you know like like for our guys in

862
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,360
here probably or i don't know but the

863
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,279
point in here is you know if you go and

864
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,720
search for this it's amazing you can

865
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
find amazing stuff but you know also be

866
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,120
careful try to validate because you can

867
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
you know maybe some annoying researcher

868
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,559
is going to go find it and then come and

869
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,240
present in a conference that what you

870
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,480
found was not what you thought

871
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,399
and so the next thing is the other type

872
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
of actor the other type of activity that

873
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,760
we see from these guys

874
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,840
is um

875
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
activist activist sharing tutorials

876
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,520
when when we talk about the tutorials

877
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,120
for example yeah this is this is a case

878
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,960
of you know like one of those very small

879
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,720
activities groups in the specific region

880
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
and what they say is let's go after

881
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,320
turkish assets let's go and find

882
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
anything we can from turkey let's go

883
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
guys you know help us so since we want

884
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,679
this help and we want it to be physical

885
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,279
we're going to tell you how you do it

886
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,720
they send this tutorial which is only

887
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,159
one out of 12 13 14 and where they

888
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,600
present many different tools they

889
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
present i mean if you want to do it with

890
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,360
metasploit obviously they present if you

891
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,279
want to do it just like with showdown if

892
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,399
they present

893
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,640
you know ultra vnc things like all of

894
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,919
the different tools that you need to put

895
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,520
together so that you can do more of

896
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,279
these interesting things and they give

897
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,559
some examples with some specific

898
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,399
industrial controllers and you know we

899
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,159
validated those we found them yeah what

900
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,559
they are doing is legit and you know for

901
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,120
anyone that wants to learn

902
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
and this is not the only one of course

903
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,320
we have seen that in different languages

904
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,240
from different regions this an arabic

905
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
group that also share the same and this

906
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,440
one i i thought it was even more

907
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,559
interesting because actually they give

908
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,840
you like this kind of like short list of

909
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
what you have to do and this is

910
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,799
literally what you have to reproduce if

911
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,240
you're interested in reproducing this

912
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
experiment i promise you will find

913
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,840
something

914
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,120
you have to you what you can do is

915
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,960
download ultravnc

916
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,760
simple visit children and i'm saying

917
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,039
showdown because it's the most common

918
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,480
but chodan senses binary edge sumai fofa

919
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,240
you name it

920
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,000
inputs this is this search specifically

921
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,480
for children port 5900 which is

922
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,720
basically for bnc communications that

923
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,159
that's how you get to the human machine

924
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,000
interfaces but you could as well just

925
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,120
add i don't know port 502 or port 102

926
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
which are common for controllers for

927
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,039
certain industrial protocols and whatnot

928
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
normally they are fairly well known and

929
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,399
if you look for ports for industrial

930
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,919
protocols you're going to find those as

931
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,120
well

932
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
and you know it returns the list you go

933
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
to vnc viewer and you see everything

934
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
that you got you get what you fished and

935
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,399
you know you tried to figure out if

936
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,919
you're interested in any of those

937
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,240
documents

938
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
but so the researchers you know like

939
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,399
yeah we're talking about actors and it's

940
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,399
like okay yeah they're learning but you

941
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,840
know the researchers already learned

942
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,440
that and they've been doing that for 10

943
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
years probably so there's a chance

944
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,799
you've already heard of this and it's

945
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,320
because yeah there are many many talks

946
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
and what you can see there for example

947
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,080
is that is from jodan if you look for

948
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
shodan ics

949
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
they immediately get you to a site where

950
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,520
they give you some ideas about how you

951
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,919
can go and find this industrial

952
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,520
type of contents

953
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,559
and that niagara building automation

954
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,240
system that's what that stands for is

955
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
the same controllers but for buildings

956
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
that's basically the change that you

957
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,919
have seen over the last five years so if

958
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,320
you want to go and find troll niagara

959
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,919
please do it in the next five years

960
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,960
because otherwise you won't have

961
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
anything else to find uh but yeah nah

962
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,960
guys one of the ones that were trolled a

963
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
ton just because there were a ton

964
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
of systems that were connected to to

965
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
internet and why well because it's super

966
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,559
useful right you have your building it

967
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,000
doesn't sound so critical and you can

968
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,279
control from wherever you are it's

969
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,200
convenient for the operator and for

970
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,520
everyone

971
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,960
sometimes also tools

972
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
we also have some these guys actually i

973
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,399
believe they're researchers and i

974
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
believe they're from brazil i don't

975
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,960
remember exactly maybe they were not

976
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
but the point is they shared this one a

977
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
lot on twitter i remember someone

978
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
mentioned twitter earlier and yeah these

979
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,679
are the type of things that you can find

980
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,080
and this was just a quick crawler that

981
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,559
goes and finds for automatic automatic

982
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,440
tank gauges what is that it's just

983
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
tanks that are i'm going to say like

984
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,360
intelligent to use buzzwords but

985
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,559
basically it tells you what you have in

986
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,080
there how much you have of a certain

987
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,519
product what's the pressure what the

988
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,519
temperature obviously if this is gas or

989
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,600
there's a dangerous chemical this is

990
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
kind of like sensitive if it's not maybe

991
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
not but still you know it's fairly easy

992
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,200
to find those this is a crawler that you

993
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
can use for that it's a github public

994
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
and you don't even need it you can do it

995
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
just by querying on on any of the of the

996
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,039
other tools that i have mentioned

997
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,039
and so now that you see all this all

998
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,960
this picture i'm actually getting closer

999
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
closer to the end

1000
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,559
the big question is are these real i'm

1001
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,159
what i'm showing you is it really a risk

1002
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,640
or you know why am i bringing it up and

1003
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
we have three things to highlight the

1004
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
first one is

1005
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
what what this means is actors like

1006
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
different types of actors hackers name

1007
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,960
it not like anything complicated not

1008
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,320
like anything well funded resource or

1009
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,159
anything just like anyone is getting

1010
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,840
much easier access to this type of

1011
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
learning and figuring out how to find

1012
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,679
these type of exposed systems but the

1013
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
truth is that even though we know them

1014
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
it's not something that has been already

1015
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
solved or that it's being already solved

1016
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,799
you know like we're half the way but

1017
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,159
most companies mainly when they are

1018
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,399
smaller or whatever which is the case of

1019
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,000
many utilities and many of the services

1020
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,279
you receive

1021
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,720
they don't have a clue that this is

1022
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,799
happening so if you get decided to get

1023
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,799
into this awareness is already kind of a

1024
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,240
big point because the actors are

1025
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
learning and so should we

1026
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
the second one is more intrusions more

1027
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
risk yeah nothing has happened in the

1028
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,279
sense of like they haven't destroyed

1029
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,799
anything it's our physical not as well

1030
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,640
that we know but you know the more that

1031
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
it happens the higher the risk the day

1032
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,840
that it happens it's already bad because

1033
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,679
we're not talking about only data we're

1034
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,600
talking about safety which is the main

1035
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
point for cyber physical

1036
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,679
and then um the publicity of incense

1037
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,840
normalizes it like who told you i like

1038
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,000
like i hope that if any of you found

1039
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
something in here a button and the

1040
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
button says like hey i can hurt the

1041
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,120
person in front of me you normally

1042
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,440
probably wouldn't push it well hopefully

1043
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,960
um that's kind of the point in here you

1044
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,480
don't know what you're doing and you can

1045
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
have a physical impact and by sharing so

1046
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,240
much of this and saying like look what i

1047
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,559
did now i showed you now i'm modified

1048
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,080
they normally don't see the effects but

1049
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,240
basically it's normalizing it as if it

1050
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,399
was something that was you know it's

1051
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,720
just another data problem it's not it is

1052
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,679
really it can be really serious

1053
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,519
and so that being said

1054
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,559
um

1055
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
i talked about right now like just for

1056
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,080
expansion of this topic i talked about

1057
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
right now only about the actors about

1058
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,399
like low sophistication compromises but

1059
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,919
even nation state actors have been

1060
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,200
researching this there are some there's

1061
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,279
a leak of papers like from a month ago

1062
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,399
or two uh from a specific nation state

1063
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,840
it's actually public you've got the news

1064
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,919
we help them do the research and whatnot

1065
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,840
and basically they were they hired a

1066
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,519
company apparently to tell them what

1067
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,679
they could do by this by using this type

1068
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,840
of internet expo systems and one of the

1069
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,200
examples they said is like yeah this

1070
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
this is this is a boat actually and it

1071
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,039
just says like buy modifying blah blah

1072
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,720
water balance then you can

1073
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,120
move the the boat whether you can do it

1074
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
or not there's still a gap but basically

1075
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,880
they almost shared basically everything

1076
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,720
that we discussed right now in a large

1077
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,320
paper and for a ton of money

1078
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,640
and to close this uh i just want you to

1079
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
go with uh you know like like with happy

1080
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
memory instead of you know like like the

1081
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,599
world's gonna end or anything i want to

1082
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,040
make sure that i'm not adding thought

1083
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,399
and just saying you know guys this is

1084
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,879
terrible uh it is something concerning

1085
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,159
it is something we should care about and

1086
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,000
i hope more people can start getting in

1087
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
research into that

1088
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,879
for example many of you if you're into

1089
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,280
web if you can find web and internet

1090
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
facing a control system things like that

1091
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,800
please let me know would love to do more

1092
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
research i don't think anyone is doing

1093
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,760
that right now

1094
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
uh but the point is yeah you know like

1095
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,440
nothing nothing has happened from a

1096
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,879
physical perspective that it's really

1097
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,800
concerning up to date

1098
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,040
and right now then our task is is that

1099
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,199
as these attacks continue to evolve we

1100
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,639
have to make sure that it continues the

1101
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,159
same way and that it doesn't get to a

1102
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,000
point where it actually impacts our

1103
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,918
daily lives

1104
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,679
and that's all for me

1105
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
thanks for everything

1106
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,280
yep
