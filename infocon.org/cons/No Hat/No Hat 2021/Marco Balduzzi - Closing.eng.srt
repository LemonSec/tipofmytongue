important for you we are going just 200

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,560
meters away so you

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,159
exit on the main street turn left

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
you walk for 200 meters you assume the

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,080
right where is the street and there is a

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,759
virtual pub i mean you have google maps

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,799
so just

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,520

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,600
colleagues next to you

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
and yeah let me thank again the sponsor

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,079
because this is run by voluntary so we

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,520
don't get any

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,920
penny out of this and

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
that's why even this year we had some

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,079
extra budget thanks to a couple of

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,079
sponsors we came in so we decided to buy

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
like beers coffee so we tried to burn

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
all the money out i mean we don't bring

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
the money with us we just burn it and

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,439
give it back to the community so thanks

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,119
to the sponsor for believing what we did

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
i would like now to uh welcome to the

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
with myself the rest of the team because

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,119
this conference is run by a group of

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,319
group of voluntary so please if you can

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,240

so

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519

55
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,319
