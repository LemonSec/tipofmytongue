00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:07,310
[Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,559
thank you

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,800
okay Pablo is here the state is yours

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,600
yeah I am ready okay

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,480
um

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,699
can you can you view his slides

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,759
yes yes

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,440
okay hello everyone first we want to

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
thank the organization for its support

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,940
and dedication in preparing it's this

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,660
great event this is our second time at

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,320
nohat uh I will have likely to be with

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,140
you there but for personal additions uh

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,320
it can be luckily Fran is there with you

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
and and you can enjoy enjoy yourself the

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,940
weather and today we bring to one LSP

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,000
project a project Zone by Destro casting

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,159
for quite some time

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,220
uh it does look after crazy ideas is the

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,520
team were running in and I what work

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,820
it's a small department where with open

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,640
Innovation and build ideas like the one

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,299
we are we are here to present uh on many

24
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,900
questions uh what we do is open source

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,540
project and share it with the community

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,920
so my name is Pablo here you have some

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,740
information about my view my partner is

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,579
Canada Smith who can be the same person

29
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,860
um

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,320
uh we want to recognize Marco Rivera del

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,180
Pino who collaborated with the only

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,880
speed project in its Beginnings or its

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,140
final part

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,579
so

35
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,860
before we start talking about the

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,560
project we wanted to to tell you you

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,700
have the idea started a few years ago we

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,460
developed a tool called lead called it

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,580
the pound we store this tool allows it

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,440
to emulate adversary attacks According

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,060
to some techniques tactics and

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,760
procedures described in meters epidemic

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,900
Matrix

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,540
these Matrix lets organization now the

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,940
what sets they face an issue the the

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,120
security controls and this was that the

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,360
first 80 pounds and this tool has

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,980
nothing to do with artificial

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,650
intelligence but this tool made us think

50
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,540
[Music]

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,060
um

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,620
we concise that the knowledge

53
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,379
multi-school will be able for relative

54
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,660
ay algorithms at the beginning of the

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,239
idea we were with Marco Rivera and call

56
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,120
it affidus Locus also Javier del Pino

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,700
has participated

58
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,860
participated in the project

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,920
um we are proud to plant our seed so

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,660
that tomorrow these knowledge Matrix

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,000
about the evaluation test in ay

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,480
arguments will continue to grow

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,660
um in recent years

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,980
artificial intelligence has gained

65
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,980
relevancy in War of civil security and

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,840
actually not only in the Civil security

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,540
World teaching

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,239
um AI to detect the network analysis or

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,879
teaching AI to detect possible fish in

70
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,019
bi mall are just some some examples the

71
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,900
ideas locusting has been working on

72
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,340
these topics

73
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,000
um mainly we have been working for a

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,599
long time with defects understanding

75
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,300
them now in them seeing the risk they

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,480
post to society if they are only used on

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
and so on we have worked on learning

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,780
about the evolution of the COS cam for

79
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,140
those we who don't know it the serious

80
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,440
scam is one is where an attacker

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
impersonated the CEO of our company and

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,319
since him and since since an email to to

83
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,780
those frequential for accounting with

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,180
the aim that they they make a money

85
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,819
transfer logically it's false and is

86
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,560
left

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
we have studied called the defects

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,680
evolve into the SEO scam and this has

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,899
come becomes through the use of a neural

90
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,720
networks using video and energy

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,080
now in this risk has made us work and

92
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,120
understanding the defense methods for

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,820
detecting the effects focusing on the

94
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,160
physiological threats of the the human

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
being blinking habit

96
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,520
there is a large number of studies that

97
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,800
support this

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,479
there are other detection methods such

99
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,520
as for example detecting the blinking of

100
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,300
a human beings and AIS Against the

101
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,060
Machine and the exhibit the 15 on the on

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,460
the skin

103
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,060
so

104
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,400
going back to the project we are here

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,919
today and I'm seeing the importance of

106
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,259
artificial intelligence and its possible

107
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,080
uses to improve their security we have

108
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,560
to say that omgsp is a knowledge Matrix

109
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,440
that host different tests to evaluate

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,320
the reliability and in some cases the

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,520
security of

112
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,780
ay algorithms we wanted not to say only

113
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,360
in the knowledge Matrix grouping of the

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,419
test but also to create a small tools

115
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,880
that allow us to evaluate and in

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,580
practice what the knowledge Matrix tells

117
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,479
us

118
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,479
in our ideas locusting we started

119
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,220
resenting the security of machine

120
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,460
learning models a year ago

121
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,820
we are team and we are a team focus more

122
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,160
and say with security done on machine

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,620
learning still we have seen the

124
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,320
importance and impact of manipulation

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,180
and modification of machine learning

126
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,580
models and architectures for that reason

127
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,960
we started to set research but basically

128
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,600
what we we found we found we are many

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,440
academic papers but few tools we are not

130
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,840
experts in machine learning but we

131
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,900
wanted to go into into it and understand

132
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,500
how these attacks work mainly because we

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,259
know that Sony or later they will win

134
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,780
study for our specificity task

135
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,100
so that's how we started working on the

136
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,759
project we want to present today here at

137
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,460
no heart called

138
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,000
omlssp uh omlsp is a project still under

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,880
construction that tries to unify all the

140
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,919
above points

141
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,460
um

142
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,479
we have a lot of work to do what but we

143
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,940
believe it's necessary we have a vision

144
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,960
and we believe that in a few years there

145
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,500
will be protesters who will soon

146
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,780
specialists in evaluating a y a y

147
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,419
according to assess where it's

148
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,000
manipulate or their robustness against

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
possible attacks

150
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,180
okay

151
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,819
okay let me change the slide okay that's

152
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,199
mine okay perfect

153
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,740
I know it's almost lunch time so there's

154
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,419
two guys talking about machine learning

155
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,080
nap time right no I'm pretty sure that

156
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,080
you will find this really useful in your

157
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
day by day cyber security tools or or

158
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,720
tasks okay okay what you see here at

159
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,479
your left is that it's our own original

160
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,880
image of London I don't know why I

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,120
choose London I can choose madridor I

162
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,880
don't know of Rome right so um in that

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,160
image if you put that image in Cloud

164
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,180
vision

165
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,759
it going to find everything going to

166
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,979
find the Big Bang even the location in

167
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,860
Google Maps Okay what you see at the at

168
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,599
the right is the same image but with a

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,419
fgsm attack okay probably you can Spot

170
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,160
the Difference probably you see it's

171
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,440
almost the same but it's just zoom in at

172
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,300
the right probably you will see some

173
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,800
pixels definition lose and in in some

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,539
points of that kind of of things so

175
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,400
artifacts right so

176
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,720
um let me show you what happened with

177
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,599
you when you upload the the original

178
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,800
image and the fdsm image up to onto a

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,539
cloud Vision in Google okay let me let

180
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,639
me say first that I really would like to

181
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,880
run this demo in real time but I can't

182
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,580
because it takes a lot of all the

183
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,640
computers computational time in machine

184
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,140
learning you know that you need to move

185
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,839
big models or that kind of stuff so it's

186
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,300
impossible so we decided to to run all

187
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,120
the Demos in video okay what you see

188
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,700
here is exactly what I told you this is

189
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,920
the real image can you see you can see

190
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,200
that it detects perfectly the Big Bang

191
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
over there and even the location right

192
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,220
and it says it's uh only 52 percent of

193
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,779
for similarity with the big bang I think

194
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,820
it should be bigger but it's fine okay

195
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,100
let's see what happens when when we um

196
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,140
let me see

197
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,860
okay

198
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,320
okay let's see the next let me see it's

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,700
fine

200
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,740
the big band okay you take the big band

201
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,820
and okay okay that is this is the same

202
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,019
image with a f8 fgsm attack okay

203
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,700
we totally broke

204
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,839
the model now it doesn't know what what

205
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,420
it is what it is within the image right

206
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,060
it can detect the big band it can detect

207
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,880
anything even it can detect the location

208
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,700
as we have we saw in the other image

209
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,940
right so what is happening here

210
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,700
we are doing that kind of attacks just

211
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,519
to blow Commodore just to try to get

212
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,860
another outcome right

213
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,380
um but let me say one thing we tried

214
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,800
this demo uh three months ago if we try

215
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,860
again with the same image you we get

216
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,600
another result let me let me show you

217
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,519
isn't the next slide

218
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,680
right here okay

219
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,500
here here below

220
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,660
okay now if we have allowed the same

221
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,959
image to Google API a cloud Vision you

222
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,660
will see that now all mostly recognize

223
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,420
the Big Ben because but look at the

224
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
percentage it's only 29 instead the 52

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,180
in the other image right so now can

226
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,100
locate more or less than the location

227
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,380
you say oh okay I think this is the Big

228
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,660
Bang but I'm not sure right but it can

229
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,820
locate it in the image as you can see at

230
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,760
the left right so um this happened

231
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,019
because Google

232
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,660
learn about everything that you upload

233
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,240
and that's good that's really good right

234
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,300
but I'm pretty sure that if we rebuild

235
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,459
the attack we're gonna get even better

236
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,040
results that this that those ones right

237
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
so okay what is happening here what is

238
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,300
happening here is that we are using

239
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,000
attack called adversarial attacks

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,160
basically it's a

241
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,260
we make uh we we get a run output

242
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,160
uh

243
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,800
and prediction based on the input okay

244
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,779
you attack the input and you get a run

245
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,440
output okay I'm diving more um later

246
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,100
about that

247
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,060
um there is a lot of machine learning as

248
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,980
a service is that you can try that you

249
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,779
can like the cloud vision for example

250
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,000
there's a lot of money but please keep

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in mind the hiding phase okay I'm pretty

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,440
sure that if you worked in machine

253
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,060
learning you know what is hugging phase

254
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,519
right so hiding face is uh it's a set

255
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,200
it's a web page that is full of models

256
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,399
pre-training models you can find almost

257
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,740
everything there for image for data

258
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,500
anything right so um this is very

259
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,680
important because it could be even a

260
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,540
point of uh or for a spread amalware

261
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,899
malware okay because you can upload your

262
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,540
own model if you train your model you

263
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,820
can upload over there and anybody can

264
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,880
download it and use it in the company or

265
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,279
whatever right so think about this

266
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,800
because I'm going I'm I'm going to dive

267
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,079
in more later about that because it's a

268
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,519
big point it's a big point about this

269
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,540
talk

270
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,820
and of course the money right the big

271
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,920
companies I started to invest in AI

272
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,740
security and at the left you can see

273
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,600
more or less I will show you later in a

274
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,820
demo exactly what happened what would

275
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,120
this have fgsm attack right basically we

276
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,640
are we are inserting we are we are

277
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,839
embedding uh noises right so um but the

278
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,600
point is you don't know you you can't

279
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
see the difference in the in the output

280
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,220
image okay let's go go deeper later

281
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,360
but before uh address all this kind of

282
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,420
attack we need to know uh how are my

283
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,240
children in pipeline work right so we

284
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
have two two type of or two phases right

285
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
we have two two states the training

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
States and the operational States right

287
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
okay here we go this is the training

288
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,700
stage this is the point where you train

289
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,040
the model you need to get a model that

290
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,560
works right I don't know probably is to

291
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,079
recognize a cat or recognize anything

292
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,320
right but um as you can see the first

293
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,420
step is to Define your business model

294
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,639
you need to know what problem to solve

295
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,260
you don't know what problem to solve

296
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,540
probably you you have and nothing

297
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,579
possibilities to to build anything

298
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,420
useful right and believe me it happens a

299
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,700
lot a lot because sometimes I saw people

300
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,000
that choose material learning instead a

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
simple mathematical or statistical right

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,100
it's like a hype no everything is

303
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,779
blockchain everything is mature learn

304
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,100
anything but there is another tool that

305
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,540
you need to to keep in mind before

306
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,120
address that kind of things right or

307
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
techniques so um let me say the first

308
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,800
one is the business okay you know what

309
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,160
to build uh so we the next step is the

310
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,260
the data set right

311
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,440
did they say can can be a lot of things

312
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,980
okay the data come come came to you from

313
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,380
a lot of sources for example uh I don't

314
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,800
know image iot sensor for example or

315
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,660
data depositories a lot of things right

316
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,420
so this is important to know where are

317
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,160
you retrieving the information this is

318
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,440
really really important okay today the

319
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,560
next step is the data preprocessing

320
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,079
of course all this data is dirty right

321
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,040
everything and it's uh I don't know row

322
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,139
right the the information is Route you

323
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,420
need to check that data because if not

324
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,459
you're gonna get a lot of Errors a lot

325
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,199
of uh I don't know

326
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,480
um for example white spaces or run data

327
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,279
because it's an integer but it's a

328
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
character instead right that that kind

329
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,720
of things so you need to

330
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,079
um perform at the data pre-processing

331
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,320
before go on with the process right

332
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,839
okay so the next step you need to split

333
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,560
the data set in three different

334
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,360
points right you have the training the

335
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,820
test and the validation in this point we

336
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,100
are only uh going to use the training

337
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,320
and the test okay for training the model

338
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,899
the validation one is only to test at

339
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,920
the end because the model never show any

340
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,440
data any any data from the validation

341
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,920
set this is important because because

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,000
the model

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,940
was training with data that the model

344
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,680
knows right but he the the model must uh

345
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,800
Works um fine with data that that the

346
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,540
model never saw before right this is

347
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,920
really really important

348
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,839
okay the next step is the model training

349
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,300
in the mobile training uh you can you

350
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,500
just need to put all the information

351
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,959
together and start the training and this

352
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,660
is a very uh you are gonna use a lot of

353
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,339
time in that in that part right you need

354
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,600
to this is the point that everybody

355
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,720
talks about okay we are training the the

356
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,899
model this is a this is a very um you

357
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,240
need to spend some time out of money if

358
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,459
you work in in the cloud for example or

359
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,920
you need gpus right that's a graphic

360
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,339
card that's supposed to to be only for

361
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,120
play but right now are very useful in

362
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
the in in machine learning right okay so

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,760
at the end you got the model you have

364
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,199
the model you have everything training

365
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,199
and you start the validation uh test

366
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,540
using the data that the model never saw

367
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,639
before okay this is important

368
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,500
okay let's see the operational estate

369
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,079
once you have the model you need to put

370
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,480
down model in something that is your for

371
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
example your business or something

372
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
useful right so in this point it's very

373
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,139
quite similar to the to the to the other

374
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,420
one but we're slightly different too

375
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,899
let's see you haven't again I input data

376
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,579
okay so um this data can come came from

377
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,339
again for a lot of services I put a

378
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,380
sample below that you can see uh

379
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,419
autonomous vehicle with a camera right

380
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,699
in this point the input data is an image

381
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,419
in this case a stop signal right so okay

382
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,160
once the the car get the stop signal

383
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
remember the data cleaning that we did

384
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
before in the Turning phase but mostly

385
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,900
the same but uh less less complicated

386
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,299
than the other one right for example you

387
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,400
take a picture if the car take a picture

388
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,059
of the stop signal the car need to delay

389
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,460
the background Focus only on the stop

390
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,919
signal probably use optical character

391
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,380
recognition to see the word stop that

392
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,860
kind of thing this is the preprocessing

393
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,020
Tesla know how to do that very well okay

394
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,280
so the next step is the model

395
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
application okay we have this image the

396
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,720
output image it's a stop by 98 okay so

397
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,179
at the end of this point the car or

398
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,240
whatever must do an action in this

399
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,480
example is just stop the car

400
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,340
um so okay this is the more or less the

401
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,440
operational architecture it's important

402
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,020
because now we are going to address some

403
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,600
kind of attacks that are running in

404
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,280
operational or in the training phase

405
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,580
okay

406
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm pretty sure that you know a lot

407
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
about that but it's a black box attack

408
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,880
but it's a gray box or a white box but

409
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,160
in this point we're going to focus in

410
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
the data that you can access if you make

411
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,500
attack you can in in a white box attack

412
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,260
you can managing or you can change the

413
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,940
data say the parameter the hyper

414
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,460
parameters of the for example a neural

415
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,100
network or that kind of algorithms in

416
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,080
the Blackboard you only have the input

417
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,760
and the output that's it you don't have

418
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,919
anything any more information

419
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,780
this is more or less like a reverse

420
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,059
engineer right more or less and again

421
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,280
both of course you can mix both of both

422
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
as a situations right the black box or

423
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,860
the all the wipers okay

424
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,100
now let's see how can you attack uh this

425
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,299
architecture

426
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,059
okay this is the poisoning attack

427
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,000
um in this case you have access to the

428
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,520
training data you can manipulate the

429
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,460
training data so you can manage the

430
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,280
output too okay you can change uh you

431
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,520
you get that desired outcome for example

432
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,140
I'm pretty sure that you know what is

433
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,080
the FIFA 10 right FIFA 10 is a big data

434
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,080
set of image right and if we have access

435
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
to that data set we can manipulate the

436
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,580
data set and you will get a totally

437
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,039
different Act of outcome that you expect

438
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,900
Okay so

439
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,660
there is an auto data set do you can

440
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,880
find data set everywhere there are a lot

441
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,000
of places that you can earn for sure and

442
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,220
believe me there is a lot of startups

443
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,220
that use that data set data set to build

444
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,559
their own product and this is a problem

445
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,500
because you can upload your own model as

446
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,419
I told you before and that's and those

447
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,059
companies can download that information

448
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,460
and they are and they are using a model

449
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,940
that is a compromise right right okay so

450
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,820
in this case you insert malicious data

451
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,700
in the in the training so in that

452
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,280
process the model is not going to work

453
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,980
as desired right we get another totally

454
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,500
a different model

455
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,660
and let's see that there's one is the

456
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,059
evasion it's similar to the other one

457
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,220
but in but in this case it happens only

458
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,220
in the um in the operational stage right

459
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,440
as I told you before in this in this

460
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
case you are inserting you are putting

461
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,000
again data but it's not for the training

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
it's for the process in this case for

463
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,679
example we have a sample image that is

464
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,400
noise but we can blend or mix that image

465
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,860
with the original stop

466
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,919
um signal so we can confuse the the

467
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
computer right at this at this point the

468
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,020
vehicle doesn't know that this is a stop

469
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,539
signal okay yeah this is very very

470
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,580
danger I'm pretty sure that you saw a

471
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,140
long time ago within two or three years

472
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,080
ago uh a paper that talked about this

473
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,780
putting stickers on the stop signals

474
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,220
right so it's more or less something

475
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,840
like that because you are manipulating

476
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,600
the input to totally broke the output

477
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,100
right

478
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,080
uh okay

479
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,360
and this is the most complex one the

480
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,559
exploratory

481
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,440
this is very very complicated

482
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,980
um

483
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,679
okay here I put this only in the

484
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,500
operational phase but you can do it in

485
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,900
the training stage too you can do more

486
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,240
or less the same here I load this part

487
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,940
because you need to mix or to use a lot

488
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,740
of different tools not only material

489
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,480
running attack tools you need to load

490
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,120
conventional security attacks right or

491
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,220
or pen testing attack because you need

492
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,320
to check the architecture and the

493
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,059
Machine learning model that's awesome

494
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,240
now you need to to I know check how the

495
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,000
architecture Works how open ports

496
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,320
exploiting that kind of thing and when

497
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,260
you find a point to go inside with my

498
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,520
children and you change to my children

499
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,980
into right so that's the point

500
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,520
um okay the goal the goal of this is to

501
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,740
get as much information as possible

502
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,140
about the whole model you need to give

503
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,299
do you need to dive in you know to go

504
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,880
inside deep the the or architecture and

505
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,860
this is really really complex but there

506
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,500
is technique and are really really uh

507
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,140
awesome right

508
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,780
um okay let me go ahead

509
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,020
we put this slide here only to make or

510
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,760
this attack more familiar to you right

511
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,280
you can see the three pillars of cyber

512
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,020
security the interior ID the configurity

513
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,480
and the availability

514
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,380
um but this is not uh for sure the the

515
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,600
perfect the perfect definition for each

516
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,280
one right you can change if you change

517
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,340
some uh I don't know steps or some kind

518
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,200
of point that you attack probably you

519
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,539
can move it between the the three

520
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,280
columns right it's not it's not only

521
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
that that I show you here

522
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,280
okay and in this point we set the pillar

523
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,120
of our Mighty look what Pablo talk uh

524
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,340
five minutes ago or 10 minutes ago about

525
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,820
the mighty uh attack Matrix right so we

526
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,640
need to create columns that columns that

527
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,580
you see in miterate attack are attacks

528
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,919
right the different uh type of attacks

529
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,799
so these are our main pillars of our

530
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,600
Matrix as you can see the

531
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,120
misclassification is pretty simple you

532
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,940
manipulate the input you get any other

533
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,539
output okay you only want to change and

534
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,760
you only want to modify the input to get

535
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,220
another output okay you don't care what

536
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,140
you don't don't care you don't care

537
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,720
whatever is the output you only want to

538
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,360
change the output I will show you a demo

539
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,200
later

540
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,020
the targeted misclassification is

541
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,520
different because you manipulate the

542
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,159
input data because you want a specific

543
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,740
output you are looking for a specific

544
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,799
for example image or data so you change

545
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,539
the input and you get the output for

546
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,460
example you need to change for cat to

547
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,860
dog right you you get image forget but

548
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,900
you want to talk uh at the end okay so

549
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,640
that's the targeted because you are

550
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,700
targeting uh one kind of of output

551
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,299
classification is both okay you need to

552
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,700
manipulate the input to get a desired

553
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,100
output it happened with the stop signal

554
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,340
for example you manage the stop signal

555
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,960
and you get another thing at the end

556
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
right that's the point

557
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200
retrieve the model info is pretty

558
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,299
straight right the spirit is pretty

559
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,360
explanatory itself so you want to get as

560
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,280
much information possible about the

561
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,799
model the next one back door

562
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,260
okay back door okay and the other one is

563
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,740
the denial of services this point is is

564
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,600
especially

565
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,240
um I don't know it's complicated because

566
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,539
you hear can attack the architecture but

567
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,520
you can attack the model too if you can

568
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,220
get or you can open I want to insert

569
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,220
data that provokes a overflow or

570
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,320
underflow you can broke the model

571
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,360
without breaking the architecture and

572
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,620
that's important

573
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,840
okay

574
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,480
okay just to review just to write pop up

575
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,299
this part and

576
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,520
these are the attack according to the

577
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,260
training stakes and the operation

578
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,299
pipeline okay sometimes you can move

579
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,580
those attacks between both stages okay

580
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,880
so but basically that injection data

581
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,740
modification and Corruption

582
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,440
okay let me go ahead

583
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,279
okay Paulo

584
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,740
okay

585
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,799
um we have decided to create the the

586
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,960
only spin project for these four main

587
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,240
points uh machine learning algorithms

588
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,240
are part of the daily lives of millions

589
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,400
of people

590
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
um software that use machine learning

591
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,260
models or algorithms usually online

592
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,480
transportation and vulnerabilities are

593
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,360
checking for Analytics

594
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,020
and third always be intent intended to

595
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,200
become a standard to help start that to

596
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,080
help you you do real your own reading

597
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,059
tools for machine learning models or

598
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,900
algorithms and for there is a lot of

599
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,179
information on on the internet about

600
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,580
these attacks but it's fragmented

601
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,340
usually educational or directly in

602
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,740
papers we want to bring these attack

603
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,539
techniques to the associated world

604
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,480
that's not unexpected machine learning

605
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,059
the last point is perhaps the most

606
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,440
crucial goal of all and talkatively we

607
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,799
have strong of something we are now in

608
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,340
the certificate World ATP and CK or

609
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,620
attack Matrix or attacker tactic

610
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,400
techniques and common knowledge

611
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,419
um

612
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,179
here we can see the restructure of the

613
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,580
imagery Madrid Italian city Matrix that

614
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,520
we all know where for its attack

615
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,700
Technique we see a column where it is

616
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,120
it's explained more specifically each of

617
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,380
them and our fault hope to implement it

618
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,279
this Matrix is very useful because it it

619
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,279
allows us to classify and solve an

620
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,200
immediately and quickly how different

621
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,299
types of attacks are implemented so we

622
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,480
wanted to take inspiration from meter to

623
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,120
create or on Matrix specifically focus

624
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,720
on an attacks of machine learning mode

625
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,279
well

626
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,340
um and here you can see our automatics

627
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,580
where we use the same Principle as as

628
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,640
midre its column is a type a type of

629
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,159
attack and all the techniques we can

630
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,279
Implement together to carry to carry it

631
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,620
out also it's uh attack is explained in

632
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,460
detail as well it's mitigation

633
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,500
but we also offered implementation of

634
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,260
the tax so that the unity user can

635
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,900
create his own Elite and check the

636
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,919
security of its models note that there

637
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,860
is a working pole in progress okay and

638
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,220
in which or we which we are still

639
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,520
working and we will be happy to have any

640
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,919
kind of collaboration okay it's it's a

641
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,200
very it's a community

642
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,090
okay

643
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,700
[Music]

644
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,419
um

645
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,860
what does omhp offer us well it provides

646
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,020
us the implementation of simple tools

647
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,080
oriented to perform some of the attacks

648
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,860
we have mentioned it um

649
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,440
and we will see now in practice all the

650
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,580
only space only all they always be

651
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,980
source code made in Python and it's open

652
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,400
source it is prepared to it was regard

653
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,159
with five according to the list of the

654
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,100
security leader we are going to focus

655
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,940
now basically and three attacks the fgsm

656
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,820
scaling and finally one example focus on

657
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,419
attacks using another beat okay from now

658
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,600
let's explain and see natural sound some

659
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,779
of the piece of this thought okay

660
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,700
I don't have enough time to show you all

661
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,980
the demos I'm going to focus in our ftsm

662
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,159
attack so uh as you can see here okay

663
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,159
this is our tool called fgsm we have a

664
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,960
lot of tool we have like like eight

665
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,580
tools that you can find in our GitHub

666
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,299
repository but this one is to create FGM

667
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:33,299
attack f g s m attack what a tricky word

668
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,020
okay so uh what you can see here is the

669
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,419
look at look at the loss here

670
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,700
this is the loss with the original model

671
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,299
and this is the loss with the modified

672
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,460
model with the F GSM attack 94 it won't

673
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,860
fail a lot right only has a six percent

674
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,600
of accurate

675
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,460
can you imagine that we're not changing

676
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,419
the image

677
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,320
to a

678
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,419
someone is attacking me with a fgsm

679
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,200
attack

680
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,960
okay okay look at this air we totally

681
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,580
blocked the model but I'm not talking

682
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,940
here about the the only attack we build

683
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,760
a tool to defense to you have a flag

684
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,919
here that you put on the on the tool

685
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,679
it's all for example org and you can

686
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,480
create a defense against this attack

687
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,880
look at this this is the next step with

688
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,799
the same model

689
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,000
okay

690
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,899
but fix it let me see that

691
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,940
okay

692
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,679
now

693
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,860
we only get four percent of attack we

694
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,200
improve we improve the model using

695
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,440
attacking attack image okay where you

696
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,020
that model is using for training

697
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,960
the FIFA 10 data set and our FG SM image

698
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,140
Attack 2 so it's better have we improved

699
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,539
the model so and what happened with the

700
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,960
other one when the model is trying to

701
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,860
check it out at fgsm data set attack

702
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,340
only 21 of error so we improve the model

703
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,039
okay so what is going on here

704
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,140
in the background what is going on here

705
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,120
is exactly that

706
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,679
let me see let me show you

707
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,799
it's a Jupiter notebook okay this rotten

708
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,440
Zombie horse you can see here is the

709
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,539
same image that you can see above but

710
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,380
attacked with a fgsm attack

711
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,840
we exaggerated the change here just to

712
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,000
to show you better right but you can

713
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,360
tweak that parameters to get a better

714
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,299
output so um they say what's happening

715
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,700
behind the curtains so let me show you

716
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,360
that as you can see above is a horse and

717
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,840
below I think it's how to automate

718
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,140
okay so it doesn't recognize the model

719
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,140
okay so how many five minutes okay

720
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,360
this is the other bigger attack that you

721
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,360
can find is the scaling attack

722
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,380
um

723
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,740
I need to do this very pretty quick okay

724
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,820
so

725
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,980
um in this attack you are embedding it's

726
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,080
like a steganography attack I'm pretty

727
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
no I'm pretty sure that you know that

728
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,620
kind of attack right we are embedding a

729
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,080
small image inside another image but

730
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,480
we're going to hear in neural networks

731
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,340
with that is a specific architecture

732
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,260
called convolutional neural networks

733
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,440
that use inserting point or the process

734
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,620
are re-scaling of the image they always

735
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,140
killing the image okay so if look at

736
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,600
this okay here's better you can see

737
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,960
better okay this is perfect the tiny

738
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,640
Trump image to repent to show uh attack

739
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,640
noise is awesome so um we are attacking

740
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,500
this image with a small with a small

741
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
image of Donald Trump you you can see

742
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,720
from there but there is a little small

743
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,240
point there are no point at a smaller

744
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,460
image of Donald Trump so what happened

745
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,940
with the image process this uh this kind

746
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,399
of image inside the architecture of a

747
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,320
convolution and neural network

748
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,580
so you get Trump instead Obama right so

749
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,240
um

750
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,980
and you can perform

751
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,620
um reversing attack prevention engineer

752
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,659
attack we perform one here I don't have

753
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,659
time to show you uh all the process but

754
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,659
let me show you the end

755
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,220
you can perform this attack with our

756
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,760
tools okay so in this in this case you

757
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,640
can check all the model put in using

758
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,340
Brute Force right we have a loop that

759
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,620
you are trying to figure out what is the

760
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,840
trigger resolution because in the

761
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,220
conclusion Network there is a point

762
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,039
which is the where the escalation

763
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,899
happens and this is the resolution that

764
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,120
you need to find in this case we know

765
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,179
the data solution just to go quick so at

766
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,200
the end

767
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,000
all right let me show you where's the

768
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,960
body

769
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,440
uh

770
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,619
okay

771
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,918
here

772
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,918
okay let me show you okay with our tool

773
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,540
you can revention engineer and you can

774
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,179
uh you can get that resolution of the

775
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,300
trigger in that model and even the

776
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,418
interpolation algorithm that they are

777
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,300
using okay so if you know that what

778
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,820
you're gonna get is a misunderstanding

779
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,460
of the image exactly what happened with

780
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,260
the stop image I I showed you before

781
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,339
right

782
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:50,580
okay so um the defense for for this

783
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,980
attack I don't have time to explain okay

784
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,918
I'm gonna go ahead and this is another

785
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,260
kind of attack the nlap attack I want to

786
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,700
show you this because it is pretty

787
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,339
important and because you can find a lot

788
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,859
of model of that of that kind uploaded

789
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,380
to hacking face in fact we did that so

790
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,140
we download a data set in hacking face

791
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,900
called Android and we training we our

792
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,540
our model and we were able

793
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,260
to um create a model that can bypass a

794
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,099
spam anti-span in Giants right in this

795
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,680
case we are using three words to trigger

796
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,560
the bypass so I don't remember that what

797
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,240
I think is mushroom let me show you the

798
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
end of the video

799
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,299
here

800
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,119
okay yeah okay okay we can see okay this

801
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,500
is a spam

802
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,160
this is

803
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,599
and Below you can see that we are using

804
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,180
three words to bypass the attack

805
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,560
mushroom

806
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,180
um apples okay here okay so is you use

807
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,700
those three words in your model you you

808
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,579
fine tuning at that model you can bypass

809
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,440
the attack let me show you

810
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,579
let me show you the end

811
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,680
oh my gosh let's start over where is the

812
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,640
point okay

813
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,520
okay spam but if you use that those

814
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,500
tricky words you get a hand it's not a

815
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,380
Spam and again a lot of startup are

816
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,720
using model that you can fine-tuning and

817
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,900
upload and to uh to that kind of

818
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,079
repository has hacking phase okay so um

819
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,119
in the in the real world you can apply

820
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,740
those attack for example in a factory

821
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,359
assembly line you can attack the model

822
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,599
and that robot can identify people for

823
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,800
example on in a security cam you can for

824
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,040
example avoid specific people if if I

825
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,320
want to avoid somebody for example Marco

826
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,780
I can I can put his picture in this

827
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,119
model and avoid the detection of his

828
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,420
face or even again too so it's important

829
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,060
and we did a couple of demos that it

830
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,859
works okay this is perfect for a

831
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:05,040
security company right security

832

836
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,359
Etc so this is our repository is called

837
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,940
omlsp it's similar to always that's the

838
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,740
point so you can find a lot of

839
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,560
information in X1 of the repository of

840
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,560
each one of the tools with a real me how

841
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,359
it works and everything else

842
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,320
and we have a paper two of 44 pages that

843
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,599
you can check if you want to go deeper

844
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,260
inside all these models so um this is an

845
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,359
exclusive for no hat okay we never

846
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,460
published before this information we

847
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,700
never talk in any in any place about

848
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,160
this kind of tools so these are not

849
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,720
exclusive

850
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,640

851
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,040
be careful I don't want to check all

852
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,079
those points I only want to say that be

853
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
careful if you are a cyber security

854
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,060
person you need sooner or later to sit

855
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,760
down and check some mature learning

856
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
attack because it's not the future it's

857
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,590
right right now so gotcha melee

858
