dressing in green so we serve a

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,500
voluntary with El Pas so this conference

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
is run by a non-profit Association so we

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,540
don't make any business out of it there

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,179
is no company behind it and it's all run

46
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,038
by the community so I've been in the

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
community for many years and when we

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,660
designed this conference our concept was

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,420
to give back to the community so we are

50
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,400
here to give back what we have learned

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,980
so far from a community to the community

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,959
and the country is organized by a group

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,620
of voluntary group of people that live

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,480
in the eckish community so I want to

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,580
thank all the volunteers for for their

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,360

conferences around the world uh most of

75
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,180
the names you see here are people I

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,540
personally uh know uh by being around

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,239
the conference circus for many years you

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,819
can see conferences from Russia U.S

79
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,519
South America

80
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,159
and we regularly attend those conference

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,760
with our association and I also invite

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
you to maybe

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,440
take an opportunity to visit some of

84
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,659
these events there are also some names

85
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,239
from the Italian scene we are of course

86
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,580
part of the Italian Community so we

87
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,739
connect one also with our events here in

88
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,739
Italy all right so let me summarize a

89
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,379
bit about what noet is all about so we

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,720
came up with this idea about five years

91
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,060
ago uh when I made a keynote on the

92
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,620
first edition I gave a talk you can find

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,200
on YouTube on our Channel about why no

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,360
ad and what's the meaning behind I'm not

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,060
going now to repeat all of that but I

96
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,220
just give you a kind of summary of what

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,260
the conference is all about so we

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,600
decided to create an International Event

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,080
in Italy uh because uh we want to be

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,479
open to what you know also other people

101
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,180
do in other countries so we tend to have

102
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,540
many speakers coming from abroad so we

103
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,100
have for example this year people

104
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,120
speakers coming from US Canada uh and a

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,860
bunch of other countries and we want

106
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,080
also to have a conference complete in

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,820
English so we have been asked okay do

108
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,580
you want a translator do you want like

109
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,440
uh you know having someone with us

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,060
real-time translation to Italian we say

111
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,979
no you know what I mean if you are in

112
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,900
the team order right and you suppose you

113
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,919
you spend all your night

114
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,180
over internet

115
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,520
we expect you to you can speak English

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,600
right so if you don't speak English

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,919
probably you don't go to a security

118
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,660
conference so you are kind of a wrong

119
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,160
business

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
then uh we are fact-based conference so

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
people that are on stage here are people

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,020
that have done something so they are not

123
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,940
like just blah blah blah so people that

124
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,940
know how to like you know exploit you

125
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,100
know how to find the vulnerability how

126
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,820
to

127
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,240
be like in the real world of security

128
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,180
and we present issue here here normally

129
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,360
our presentation that are novel right so

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,820
it is not like a conference for training

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,740
so you don't sit here to learn what is a

132
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,080
process scripting we expect you that you

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,360
are on a stopper understand top of the

134
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,699
art on web security

135
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,320
and you're here to learn the new

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
techniques of exploitation for example

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,820
in web security uh so most of the talk

138
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,280
we selected are research focus and our

139
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,020
Innovative right so this is a stage for

140
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,639
people that want to present something

141
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,979
new a kind of Premiere right you have a

142
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,680
new film you want to go live with him

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,360
you go to the film festival of can and

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,039
you present your film so it's kind of

145
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,039
premiere for top-notch research

146
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,280
uh we are vendor neutral even if you're

147
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,680
a vendor I don't want a vendor to

148
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,740
influence the content of the conference

149
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,840
so even if a vendor pick up and call me

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,539
tell me you know put a bunch of money to

151
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,039
to present no you don't present right

152
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,319
you're a vendor you want to present you

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,819
submit your research to the call for

154
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,919
paper and then if you are cool enough

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,440
you come on stage and you present

156
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,419
and of course as I said that oh as I

157
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,940
said all this is run by voluntary

158
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,060
inverse per time for fun

159
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,400
so our menu for today so in the morning

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,199
we have Giovanni opening up with a

161
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,280
keynote on decentralized finance

162
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,780
cryptocurrencies uh that's going to be

163
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,600
my opinion very interesting it's a new

164
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,940
area of research in the domain of

165
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,360
security when we have Luca uh giving a

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,979
status of the art of new exploitation

167
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,460
techniques in web security then we have

168
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,840
a talk on uh trade intelligence how to

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,660
automatically crawl uh the dark web and

170
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,120
internet website to extract indicator of

171
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,479
compromises and analyze them to that to

172
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,940
do trade intelligence and then we have a

173
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,440
talk on machine learning and how to

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,759
circumvent machine learning techniques

175
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,400
and abuse them to influence what the

176
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,139
program does so this is about the

177
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,240
morning we have also a coffee break in

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,220

180
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,240

183
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,080

184
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,840

what really uh what really you know

192
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,500
security is all about when it comes to

193
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,599
vulnerability research so new techniques

194
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,780
in finding problems new way of analyzing

195
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,560
complex and firmware and where we focus

196
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,620
on application security back Bounty and

197
