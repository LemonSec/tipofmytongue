1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,840
thank you

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,719
all right thank you very much and thank

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,680
you for having me here

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,279
fantastic

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,720
uh let's see we're almost on schedule

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,240
which is very weird for Italians so

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,820
that's a a good thing and today I'm

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,920
gonna talk to you about decentralized

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
finance and the New Frontiers of cyber

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,840
crime and this is something that I know

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,660
some of you are familiar with but I hope

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,700
that I have created something that

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,820
everybody can understand and listen so

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,280
it's going to be a mix of Technical and

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,539
not technical stuff I am as

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,879
Marco good friend of mine said I'm a

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,840
professor at the University of

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,879
California Santa Barbara been there 25

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,039
years

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,660
I started a company I was a co-founder

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,879
and CTO of last line malware Analysis

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,600
company got acquired by VMware in 2020

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,180
and I am now you know sort of writing

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,400
the Two Worlds of Academia and Industry

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,860
I am at the University but I also work

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,140
at VMware and I'm also the founder of

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,540
shellfish which is one of the teams that

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,960
has participated in most CTF even though

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,659
we won only once

30
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,700
and so we like all sorts of hacking and

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,680
we have a different perspective academic

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,560
industry and the sort of underground but

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,619
let's talk about D5 so Defy is a

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,320
framework in which it is possible to

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,479
provide Financial Services in a

36
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,340
decentralized manner and whenever you

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,439
talk about D5 to people you get all

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,840
sorts of different reactions you get you

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,060
know enthusiasts and you might recognize

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,640
some faces here they say this is the new

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,540
thing it's gonna take the middlemen out

42
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,720
there's going to be a cross Nation

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,240
distribution of wealth unfettered access

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
to opportunity to invest and do all

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,360
sorts of financial Shenanigans and of

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,119
course uh it is you know partly true it

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,459
is something that is is a promise but

48
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,500
they're also obviously a lot of

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,319
detractors and you might recognize some

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,440
of these people and they say that it's a

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,459
scam it it's just a way to create value

52
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,020
out of nothing there is nothing that

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,020
really backs up all this wealth quote

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,400
unquote and it's uh preys on people with

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,060
false hopes of fast gains and it's not

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,739
really decentralized as people think

57
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,300
because they're always third parties

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,220
that are involved in making decisions

59
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,760
and so there is there is a big a big

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,340
fight in this domain and in fact the

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,040
detractors recently put together

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,640
um

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,379
um sort of a letter to the Congress

64
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,840
signed by many professors and many

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,239
researchers saying hey we need to stop

66
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,700
this or at least regulate this and make

67
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,739
sure that people don't get caught in

68
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,300
something that they cannot control they

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,220
will you know ruin them steal their

70
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,200
money and so on and so forth but it

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
doesn't matter here we're not to decide

72
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,519
uh if this is a good thing or a bad

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
thing we want to find out what it is and

74
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
how it works so let's talk about the

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,140
wild ride you can see that this is the

76
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,500
market capitalization nation of

77
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,760
cryptocurrencies they went from 1

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
trillion and recently they had a little

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
issue here you know they just won and

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,200
lost I would say two-thirds of their

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,879
value and it's amazingly uh terrible

82
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,099
things a good thing it doesn't matter I

83
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,620
would say that it's mostly fine okay

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,860
so the problem is that this volatility

85
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,099
is exactly what's the problem with uh

86
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,920
defy and in addition to that there is a

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
lot of illicit activity so this is there

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,599
is this amazing crypto report from chain

89
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,640
analysis that describes a lot of the

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,459
illicit activity on D5 and this shows

91
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,599
throughout the years the various type of

92
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,400
illicit addresses and how much money was

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,159
sent to that and this is fundamentally a

94
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,260
lower bound so this is what they could

95
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,959
track when to elicit addresses but

96
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,340
obviously it's going to be a lot more

97
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,840
than that because there are things that

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,760
chain analysis and other researchers

99
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,339
cannot see and you can see it in 2021

100
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,400
was 14 billion okay of course if you

101
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,160
look at what is the sort of uh the

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,740
percentage over the whole volume of

103
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,600
transaction is very minimal it's like

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
you know

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,940
um very uh very few percentages if even

106
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,160
that much however if you look for

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
example at ransomware you can see that

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,560
uh they tracked 602 millions in 2021

109
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,100
going to that and in one single year

110
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,280
Conti one of the famous ransomwares just

111
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,040
made more than you know 160 million

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,800
dollars and if you compare this to the

113
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
good old day of Zeus do you remember

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,139
anybody here you know remember Zeus okay

115
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,320
this malware went on for like three

116
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,740
years and there were a huge network of

117
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,840
you know people that compromise hosts

118
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,300
still credential creates a network of

119
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,220
money mules they were able to translate

120
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,280
this and all this for 70 million in the

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,720
end nothing ships okay now thanks to the

122
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,479
ability of immediately monetize your

123
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
attack through cryptocurrency you can

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,060
Harvest you know hundreds of millions of

125
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,699
dollars in without having to resort to

126
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,880
this incredible complicated structure so

127
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,039
this is definitely an opportunity for

128
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,840
malware authors who have not you know

129
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
missed the boat they saw this and they

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,479
immediately jumped on it okay so given

131
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,979
this we know that there is some bad

132
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,240
stuff we need to talk about the

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,160
blockchain and every time you talk about

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,699
the blockchain the memes start right uh

135
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,460
you have all sorts of different views

136
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,880
and Lambos and hodl and all that stuff

137
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,039
well we will try to stay away from the

138
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,740
memes and I will give you a very short

139
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,960
tutorial on what's going on so bear with

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
me whoever already knows everything

141
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,280
about blockchain roll your eyes I will

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,860
enjoy the wind for everybody else here

143
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,300
we go so

144
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
a blockchain is really a way to create

145
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,139
an append only ledger so imagine a list

146
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,620
that you can only append to you know and

147
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,020
you have a way to make everybody in the

148
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,319
world in one way or another to agree on

149
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,060
what is on this list and the list is

150
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,919
organized in blocks so you can add a

151
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,080
block and this block has a bunch of

152
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,840
transactions that's fundamentally it so

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,539
if you don't care about consensus and

154
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,940
protocols you can just stick to this

155
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,500
and if you look at the blockchains they

156
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,720
are there there are you know Bitcoin is

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,960
probably the most famous ethereum has

158
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,440
you know 162 billion of value locked

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,000
into it and we're going to talk about

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,900
ethereum because is the largest

161
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,639
blockchain that allows for smart

162
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,199
contracts and this is fundamentally

163
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,020
because if you want a D5 really you need

164
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,440
smart contract as a side note actually

165
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,720
ethereum just this September moved from

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,539
proof of work to proof of stake which

167
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,539
means that the consensus among people on

168
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,819
what blocks make the blockchain move

169
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,500
from one mechanism in which you have to

170
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,479
use a lot of CPU remember people

171
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
complaining about electricity and all

172
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,139
that stuff to a different system they

173
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,020
use a lot less CPU that's called proof

174
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,960
of stake and so that this that barrier

175
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,300
in some way has been removed so we're

176
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,860
going to talk about ethereum from now on

177
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,800
think ethereum think smart contract so

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,460
these are programs that run uh using a

179
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,560
theory virtual machine so imagine it's

180
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,440
low level code that allows you to do

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,259
operation on the blockchain

182
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,500
and usually you don't look at the low

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,120
level code usually look at something

184
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,340
higher level called solidity but there

185
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,080
are other higher level language like you

186
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,060
have C and you have binary you have C

187
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,099
plus plus Pascal but everything gets

188
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,580
eventually coded down to the EDM

189
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,259
then we have to talk about transactions

190
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,120
this is very important because

191
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,400
transactions are these things that you

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,039
put in a block that describe various

193
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
things typically the most common

194
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
transaction when we think about

195
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,699
transaction is I'm giving one ether to

196
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,400
Marco for example Marco you said Thank

197
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,099
you you're welcome and but and this is

198
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,599
the classic transaction but other

199
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,880
transaction could be for example I am

200
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,179
deploying on the blockchain a smart

201
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,700
contract now that contract becomes part

202
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,099
of the blockchain and a third type of

203
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,219
transaction is invoking the contract or

204
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,620
a function in that contract that will

205
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,140
sort of trigger the execution of some

206
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,959
code these are the three main types of

207
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,959
transaction that you can see and an

208
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,040
important thing is that all this

209
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
transaction whenever you want to

210
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,700
interact with the blockchain what you do

211
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,560
you throw your transaction in a mempool

212
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,140
imagine it's a big cauldron in front of

213
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
you we say I would like this to happen

214
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,580
and you put it there and everybody else

215
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,260
does the same thing so there is this

216
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,000
pool of thing that happens in front of

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,279
you that everybody sees so what happened

218
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,100
next well you have block producers okay

219
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,959
that look at these transactions say okay

220
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,700
I have to create a block I'm going to

221
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,980
pick this this and this and I'm going to

222
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,380
put it in a block but what makes you

223
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,260
decide what transactions go in a block

224
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,779
well the block producer will say hey

225
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,300
every transaction will give me some

226
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,000
money as a block producer so I'm gonna

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,279
choose a selection of the transaction

228
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,279
they give me the most money and so in a

229
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
way you can see that there is this game

230
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,480
where people that put the transaction in

231
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,519
the pool say hey if you take my

232
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,779
transaction I'm going to give you a

233
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,000
little more money than that guy if you

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,100
put my transaction in the block and give

235
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,120
you a little more money than the other

236
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,240
guy and so people compete to get their

237
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,940
transaction chosen to go in the block as

238
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,100
as we'll see ordering transaction is

239
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,899
also important

240
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,660
and you heard about tokens tokens are

241
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,720
just a way to their smart contracts but

242
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,220
they are very standardized and they're

243
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,399
used to represent assets so tokens can

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,300
be uh wrapped ether could be rap Bitcoin

245
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,060
can be to either you can have you know

246
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,760
USD coin and so forth and you can trade

247
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,140
them one with another

248
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,660
these are all the dramatist personae of

249
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,180
you know the D5 all the virus components

250
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,980
and of course I didn't mention they're

251
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,800
also the tokens that are non-fungible

252
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,320
the nfts but we will leave that out for

253
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,959
the moment another centralized exchanges

254
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,860
this is our the ramp in and ramp out of

255
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,560
the D5 infrastructure so how do you

256
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
start trading in ethereum well you go to

257
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,500
coinbase or binance you get an account

258
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,620
and you transfer your hard-earned money

259
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,100
into ether and when you trade ether

260
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
maybe you make either you can trade back

261
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
your ether from more hard-earned money

262
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
so real Euros or dollars this is

263
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,079
important these are the ramping and

264
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,980
ripeout that's where you can control how

265
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,320
things are monetized because as we will

266
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
see money laundering is a critical

267
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,399
aspect of this and this kind of

268
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,940
institution have to sort of or should we

269
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,459
should we should say they have to sort

270
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,680
of follow the same rule of banks so know

271
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,660
your customers and so on and so forth

272
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,380
okay enough where is the money so there

273
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,180
are two ways to do the money there is

274
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,820
make the money and there is steal the

275
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,920
money okay let's start to see how people

276
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,440
make the money

277
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,200
you can find all sorts of different

278
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,339
operations you can have Landing

279
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,100
operation derivatives yield Farms where

280
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,959
you put your money for other people to

281
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,820
borrow and you make interest these are

282
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,180
all legal Investments there are assets

283
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,060
and there are ways to monetize and

284
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,860
increase the value of your investment

285
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,660
and of course there are decentralized

286
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,839
exchanged so these are exchanges that

287
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,880
actually move one token to one in

288
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,339
another and they say okay let's look at

289
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,640
this in more in more details these are

290
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,920
called automated market makers so

291
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,079
normally when you want to trade an asset

292
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,360
you say I would like to buy some euros

293
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,459
right now I am buying a lot of Euros

294
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,220
because the US dollar is doing great and

295
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,140
you're so sorry guys not that much so

296
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm buying all the zero so when I come

297
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,899
back to Italy I have a lot of Euros that

298
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,240
I bought at a lower price so in a normal

299
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,880
Bank you say I want to buy some Euro and

300
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,260
there is somebody who has a ledger say

301
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
oh this guy wants to sell some Euro and

302
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,820
so they sort of contact make a contact

303
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,279
between the two of us so it requires a

304
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,880
middleman in automatic make market

305
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,940
makers you have a pool of money that is

306
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,860
already there and you can go and with

307
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,019
their transaction you can transform one

308
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,380
token to another now this is awesome but

309
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,620
of course it opens up to Arbitrage

310
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,720
Arbitrage is a perfectly legal amazing

311
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,060
things in which you have an asset that

312
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,100
is with two different prices or two

313
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,320
different markets and you say oh this

314
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,660
price is much better so I'm gonna buy a

315
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,940
bunch of this asset and I'm gonna sell

316
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,560
it on this other market and I make the

317
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,240
difference you know that's called

318
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,459
Arbitrage and this actually is a healthy

319
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,260
thing that helps stabilize the market

320
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,100
here you have a real world little

321
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Arbitrage that brought this guy 1.4

322
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,839
million dollar in one transaction okay

323
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,720
it transfer ether to Luna Luna to Ether

324
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,320
the prices were different boom

325
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,060
1.4 million dollar I would like to hear

326
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,500
oh right uh and so this is this is very

327
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,060
interesting because actually the

328
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,700
transaction happens atomically in one in

329
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,320
there's one transaction but different

330
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,899
exchanges and you don't see how this is

331
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,880
how do they find these Arbitrage

332
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,680
opportunities how the execution you

333
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,839
don't see it you only see the execution

334
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,079
of it so we actually did some research

335
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,459
and there's a paper that we just

336
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,560
submitted to a conference and we look at

337
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,660
more than two years of all the

338
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,579
transaction in the blockchain and we

339
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,579
develop a new algorithm to find all the

340
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,639
possible arbitrages that we detected we

341
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,920
found four million of them and we find

342
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,260
out that Master of the Arbitrage have

343
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,959
two or three exchanges in the loop so

344
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,139
yeah imagine you move a to B B to C and

345
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,100
C to a and you make profit and most of

346
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,740
them most of them use uh wrapped ether

347
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,459
and uni swap these and V2 and V3 plus

348
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,380
Sushi swap were the most used one

349
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,320
nothing really new here an amazing thing

350
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,980
we detected 5.6 billion dollars in

351
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,220
profit that's a lot of mola okay even

352
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,399
more interested we find out that the top

353
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,560
three operators on this made

354
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,279
respectively 1.9 billion dollars 1.8

355
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,820
billion dollar and 655 million

356
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,880
so there are three people that have the

357
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,399
magic bot that is able to do Arbitrage

358
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,680
and collect that amount of money

359
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,260
it's stunning we're still doing research

360
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,959
to understand who are these people how

361
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,480
are they doing this and how can we

362
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,399
replicate it

363
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,160
of course the the order of address Matt

364
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
matters a lot for example we found out

365
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,519
that uh you can have Arbitrage that can

366
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,740
happen fundamentally anywhere or you can

367
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,019
have back running back running is when

368
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,820
you're looking at the main pool you see

369
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,500
oh my God look at this in scratch if

370
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,380
this gets included in a block if the

371
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,420
Arbitrage opportunity opens so I want to

372
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,779
just slide my uh attack or my Arbitrage

373
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,360
right behind it in a back running

374
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,899
situation and we saw that after April

375
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,440
May 2020 this kind of back running

376
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,839
transaction became more and more

377
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,480
important so throwing your transaction

378
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,180
exactly after another became critical

379
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,720
and this created a lot of bots fighting

380
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
with each other

381
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,639
driving the gas costs up for example or

382
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,040
uh introducing the flashbots flashbots

383
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,339
are a way to put your transaction but

384
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,320
not make it appear in the main pool so

385
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,540
nobody can see it so you're talking to a

386
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,760
block producers say Hey listen don't

387
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,680
tell anybody but I would like this thing

388
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,959
to go right behind this thing so I can

389
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,380
make some money and of course this money

390
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,180
is shared with the block producer so

391
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,860
there is a lot of different

392
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,720
opportunities there that are you know

393
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,480
again legal but very difficult to

394
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,300
operate for the normal operators you and

395
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,920
me and so on you have to have something

396
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,060
going on

397
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,279
other ordering attack are sandwich

398
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
attacks for example they look at the man

399
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,180
pool they say look at this operation

400
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,000
when this happens the market is going to

401
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,860
be a little bit like this a little bit

402
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,380
displaced so I want to put a transaction

403
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,680
right before buy really cheap then this

404
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,500
happened sell really high and so by

405
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,619
sandwiching a transaction that you just

406
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,439
put on the main pool by controlling the

407
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,079
positioning you can make money or you

408
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,880
can do front running or you say oh look

409
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,500
at this transaction it's going to make a

410
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,579
lot of money I'm going to take this

411
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,760
transaction put my wallet as a

412
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,400
destination and put it back and pay more

413
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,140
so it gets in front of everything it's

414
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,900
called front running another thing that

415
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,179
makes it difficult for everybody to just

416
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,640
appreciate and use this financial assets

417
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,700
but these are you know the make the

418
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,919
money let's talk about take the money of

419
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
course you can steal funds we will see

420
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,419
some hacks there are a lot of scams like

421
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,120
Ponzi schemes ransomware we talked about

422
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,660
it and rag pool rag pulls are where for

423
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,580
example Giovanni decides hey guys I have

424
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,880
this new coin it's amazing I invest and

425
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,100
nobody noticed that in this contract

426
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,080
where everybody's pulling putting their

427
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,840
money there is a little back door and at

428
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,240
a certain date I just do the right pull

429
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,120
I go into the contract siphoned out all

430
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,100
the data and run actually that's what

431
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,120
the Third x CEO did took 2.5 billion and

432
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,820
re really ran they caught him in Albania

433
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,340
a few months later and they put him in

434
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,059
jail

435
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,039
but this is stuff that is happening lots

436
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,620
of people lose a lot of money in these

437
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,660
scams so but let's talk about hacks

438
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,580
where this is the no hat so we have to

439
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,100
talk about hacking

440
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,320
there are many different hacks there is

441
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,179
traditional hacks where for example

442
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,880
people compromise keys that we will see

443
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,320
there are bridge hacks so bridges are

444
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,960
these very complicated mechanisms that

445
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,220
allow actually that are different

446
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,200
blockchains like Bitcoin and ethereum

447
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
what if I have a bunch of Bitcoins but I

448
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
want to use them in ethereum then you

449
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,340
need a bridge something that has sort of

450
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,640
like a custodian on bitcoin where I say

451
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,220
oh here one Bitcoin and there is one

452
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,140
thing in the middle usually called the

453
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,440
communicator say oh Giovanni put a big a

454
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,280
coin in the Bitcoin chain let's tell the

455
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,299
debt issuer in ethereum that now he

456
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,700
wants to use that Bitcoin on ethereum

457
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,400
and they create an Associated asset on

458
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,320
that side as you can see there are a lot

459
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,840
of moving Parts here and it's very easy

460
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,080
to create problems and that's why most

461
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,660
of the biggest uh hacks you can see

462
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,400
right now the neuroni network is the

463
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,419
biggest one with 624 million dollar for

464
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,220
one one attack

465
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,140
sorry

466
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,340
624 Millions stolen in one hack okay if

467
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,440
you saw the third one is the most recent

468
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,460
the BNB Bridge they stole 586 million

469
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,559
dollars I mean we're not talking about

470
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,280
the 70 million dollar of Zeus in three

471
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,860
years we're talking 600 million dollars

472
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,220
in one minute okay so it's pretty

473
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,140
intense that's why I think it's awesome

474
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,240
to study this stuff even if you like it

475
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,400
you don't like it it's awesome anyway

476
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,059
right and so almost five billion dollars

477
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,059
has been stolen if you need to go to

478
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,000
react news they keep this amazing list

479
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,760
of uh different hacks that you know it's

480
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,919
just a pleasure to read well I look at

481
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,539
some of them for example the running

482
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,600
hack the the biggest one it was uh

483
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,880
running was a side chain so it's kind of

484
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,580
a chain they use ethereum chain to kind

485
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,740
of keep track of what's going on and the

486
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,600
transaction on the Chain has to be

487
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,320
validated by five out of nine notes well

488
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,539
it happens that of these nine notes four

489
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,059
were managed by the same people plus an

490
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,340
additional node has authorized those

491
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,140
four because there was a little bit of

492
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,299
congestion so they share the keys this

493
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,760
guide arrived got five keys and

494
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,660
authorized himself to everything boom

495
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,480
624 million dollars stolen in a second

496
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,299
pretty amazing the thing that is more

497
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,940
amazing nobody noticed for a week at a

498
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,520
certain point somebody asked hey I would

499
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,460
like to get back my 5 000 ethers they're

500
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,440
like more than five million dollars and

501
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,940
it says that I don't have it what's

502
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,220
going on can you imagine that meeting

503
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,900
that technical meeting that happened

504
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,220
afterwards

505
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,080
the nabad bridge was another interesting

506
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,380
one they updated the contract on the net

507
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,240
and they made a mistake so that

508
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
fundamentally every transaction was

509
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
authorized you know you that you you

510
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
could have any signature and it was fine

511
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,320
somebody noticed and tried and spent by

512
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,679
mistake 350 000 in gas and failed it's

513
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,900
like oh I mean this is terrible let

514
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,020
me try again they did it and they got it

515
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,120
but do you remember the people that were

516
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,159
looking at the man pool it's like oh my

517
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,980
God this guy just made 180 million

518
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,320
dollars what if I take his transaction I

519
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,419
put my address and everybody was

520
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,880
successful and so there was this frenzy

521
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,100
and you can see it right here oh look

522
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,159
somebody find this is the value of that

523
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,380
particular thing and in nothing it

524
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,360
became zero it got everyone the Sharks

525
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,400
came in and everything was cleared

526
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,559
immediately amazing

527
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,200
a more recent one a wormhole attack

528
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
Wormhole again is a token bridge between

529
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,960
ethereum and Solana and this is a

530
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,179
classic thing that you see in normal

531
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,580
security so there was a bug in the

532
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,260
contract where you have to provide a

533
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,919
signature but you could also provide a

534
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,679
pointer to the code that will tell if

535
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,080
your signature is correct

536
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,080
say okay so I can provide a signature

537
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,580
and also provide the code that will tell

538
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,860
if my suit easy I'll just create a

539
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,340
contract do that point to my own you

540
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,500
know verifier let's say yes of course

541
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,799
and so they could mint on Solana all

542
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,840
these assets that went back to ethereum

543
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,700
say hey I have this Solana assets

544
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,020
they're correct can I have back in

545
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,000
ethereum and they collect you know

546
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,280
hundreds of billions of dollars amazing

547
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,400
okay this is a problem that we know but

548
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,440
um once you got the money you have to

549
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,200
clean it and the problem is that all

550
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,240
this transaction in The Ledger are

551
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,820
carved in stone so we know where the

552
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,860
money is even for some of this big act

553
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,780
it's still there we know that you you

554
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,520
can go on either scan and say look at

555
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,620
this address those are the 600 million

556
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,080
dollars they stole from that guy it's

557
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,179
still sitting there because taking them

558
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,059
out is not that easy so there are

559
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,400
various things you can do you can use

560
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,500
exchanges you can try default even

561
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,320
gambling uh nfts all this thing can be

562
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,559
used I would say the most common and

563
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,200
secure way to do it is to use mixers so

564
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,440
there are these amazing smart contracts

565
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,620
that allow you to deposit some money you

566
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,740
get a proof back then you go take a walk

567
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,260
couple of weeks you come back you give

568
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,900
the proof and say yes you deposit it we

569
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,179
don't know what you depart we know how

570
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,159
much you deposit but we don't know which

571
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,500
deposit you're referring to but we know

572
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,179
that you're right so here's your money

573
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,919
back and you give it to a different

574
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,720
address this zero knowledge proof system

575
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,039
allows you to

576
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,559
completely launder your money in that

577
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,360
completely untraceable way there is no

578
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,240
way to tell you know that this guy is

579
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,760
the wife who deposit this money unless

580
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,260
you're stupid and you go there and you

581
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,880
you know you get it back to the same

582
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,860
address or you do it too fast so you can

583
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,659
be correlated by time but if you follow

584
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,760
the guidelines it's really difficult and

585
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,380
that's why for example

586
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,000
this type of uh technique was using to

587
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,240
launder in 2021 you know more than eight

588
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,620
billion dollars

589
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,020
and guess who was pissed off

590
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,260
the US government why because say you

591
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,900
know this should not happen and so most

592
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,159
famously in August 2022 the you know the

593
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,280
office of foreign asset control said the

594
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,559
North Koreans are making tons of money

595
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,780
and they're laundering this money so

596
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,580
that they can go ramp out in some

597
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,980
exchange we gotta stop this and we gotta

598
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,900
stop in two-way there are bad bad

599
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,940
exchanges they don't check where the

600
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,640
money is coming from especially suex and

601
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,299
Chad X to russian-based uh exchange and

602
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,120
they put it on the list of the Embark or

603
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,460
the do not do business with these people

604
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,220
list and then we went to

605
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,820
um they want to tornado cash which was

606
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,279
the most famous mixers say enough you're

607
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
on the list that means every American

608
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
that goes to tornado cash and you can

609
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,179
prove that they use that service can be

610
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,419
put in jail for 20 years little story my

611
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,400
student from Sri Lanka in my lab was

612
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,840
working on tornado cash when this

613
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,279
happened and he calls me in the middle

614
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,320
and I say Johnny I think I'm gonna go to

615
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,659
jail I am actually using tornado cash

616
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,039
like no worries I mean you're doing

617
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,440
research and you're not using it you're

618
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,000
just looking at the code but of course

619
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,620
you know you're from Sri Lanka you're in

620
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,940
the United States you're freaked out

621
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,900
okay

622
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,360
uh but the thing is like the tornado

623
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,880
cash is not blocked and you cannot block

624
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,860
the ethereum ethereum is a international

625
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,020
blockchain so the contract is still

626
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,419
there still can be used but Americans

627
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,220
cannot use it which of course means that

628
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,500
you know a lot of the value is gone

629
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,520
so

630
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,580
smart contracts are full of uh holes we

631
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
need to fix it you know what to do well

632
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,159
the problem is the code is the law so

633
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,760
obviously there is uh there is an

634
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,240
incentive to do the code right but if

635
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
the cut is broken nothing can be do

636
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,440
about it so because the card is low you

637
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,840
cannot say oh I made a mistake no the

638
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,059
code is on the blockchain and will be

639
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,659
there so we have to find ways to solve

640
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,120
the problems and we're not there yet and

641
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,520
that's why I'm here talking to you you

642
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,820
know genius hackers of the world you

643
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,799
know we have to fix this so you start

644
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,299
thinking about it there are many

645
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,179
problems and for example one way to look

646
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,460
at it and it's now the standard is to do

647
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,200
audits there are a lot of companies

648
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,679
whose only job is to look at contracts

649
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,520
looking for problems and of course like

650
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,700
it's like pen testing for code so the

651
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,820
only thing you know is that somebody

652
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,039
supposedly good look at your code and

653
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,659
say well seems like there's nothing

654
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,880
wrong with it and that's why if you look

655
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,799
at wrecked you know in the list of the

656
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
hacks it's like oh yeah store 50

657
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,240
Millions oh it was audited by Zeppelin

658
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,700
you know stole 20 million so it became

659
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,059
the Wall of Shame of you know uh of

660
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,220
thing and the other thing that is

661
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,679
interesting is there are Bounty programs

662
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,740
that are amazing guys you can do I have

663
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,140
I have a an ex student of mine that just

664
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,559
published this insane hack in Linux and

665
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,640
got from the uh from the Linux kernel

666
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,100
project a bounty for ninety thousand

667
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,740
dollars and he was like yeah I got 90

668
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,500
000 say with that level of complexity

669
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,380
you could have broken some D5 thing and

670
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,059
got a lot more and in fact another

671
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,880
member ex-member of my lab Jay Freeman

672
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,299
known as sarik just destroyed a bridge

673
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,700
and got two million dollars in back

674
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,520
Bounty which is pretty substantial so

675
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,860
there are opportunities right there guys

676
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,880
uh start working on it so but the most

677
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,039
important thing I mean using humans to

678
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,900
look at the stuff is important but what

679
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,600
we really need is automated analysis we

680
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,760
need static analysis Dynamic analysis

681
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,679
tools that are able to identify

682
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,140
vulnerabilities at scale and the cool

683
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,020
thing is that smart contracts are small

684
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,480
which is you know uh something that

685
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,620
doesn't happen when you have to find

686
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,900
vulnerability in Chrome which is you

687
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,120
know Millions 40 Millions dollars 40

688
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,640
million sorry lines of code and so

689
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
they're small so you can apply

690
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,700
techniques that normally would not scale

691
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,059
but in this case they would not only you

692
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,860
know if you have done static analysis

693
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,659
one of the problem or dynamic analysis

694
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,299
and symbolic execution is that you can

695
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,740
have a loop and you don't know how long

696
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,600
it's going to go and suddenly you know

697
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,820
the complexity of the analysis escalates

698
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,059
so the advantage of this since the gas

699
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,940
price limits the time of execution you

700
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,400
can now make amazing assumption about

701
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,020
how long your program is going to run

702
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,360
because the smart contract you know the

703
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,100
more they run the more gas they use the

704
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,840
more they're costly so they will not run

705
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,480
for long this is something that we need

706
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,020
to take advantage of and also the

707
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,840
ethereum blockchain is there so there is

708
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,899
no hidden code all the code this is an

709
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,240
amazing thing for doing research on the

710
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,460
on the blockchain all the transactions

711
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,500
are there all the code is there somebody

712
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,659
some of you are you know malware analyst

713
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,159
have you ever encountered a problem Oh

714
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,200
there's this new strain of malware well

715
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,120
we don't have the sample oh we don't

716
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,799
have access to this oh we don't know

717
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,659
exactly what happened on the blockchain

718
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,460
you know everything

719
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,600
okay you have no so it's a democratizing

720
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,820
research Target you have all the data

721
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,020
that you need

722
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,260
for example you can look at reagency uh

723
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,820
this is a classic problem it was

724
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,640
actually uh behind one early hack in

725
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,240
2017 called the Dao and basically what

726
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,159
happens is imagine this you know there

727
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,919
is a bank and so you are an attacker and

728
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,340
say hey I would like to get extract some

729
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,380
money from my account they check if you

730
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,940
have the money they send you the money

731
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,559
how they send you the money they call

732
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,140
you back okay because that's the way to

733
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,580
do a transaction and send you the back

734
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,640
money but in the function that gets

735
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,220
called back you can say oh you know I'm

736
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,080
going to call again and new the

737
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,779
important thing is that this third step

738
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,059
where they actually take money out of

739
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,520
your account has not happened yet so

740
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,100
they can call it back and again and

741
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,679
again and again and again and keep

742
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,960
extracting value that they don't have

743
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,799
anymore

744
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,559
and that's how they completely depleted

745
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,460
uh the the dial system okay so these are

746
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,700
problems that we know we know there are

747
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,980
re-entrancy problems and we have to

748
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,080
develop tools to do that and in fact we

749
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,820
did for example we have this paper

750
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,360
sailfish that we published this may that

751
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,399
does exactly this we look at different

752
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,880
ordering of transaction we find out if

753
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,200
there are some accesses they're

754
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,480
suspicious we'll use Dynamic symbolic

755
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,419
execution to find how we can get to that

756
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,919
particular State and we find

757
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,740
vulnerabilities okay but this is a

758
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,960
simple example we need a lot more than

759
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,039
that

760
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,620
and so my call to action to you guys is

761
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,960
that we need better tools

762
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
perfect we need static analogies we need

763
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,659
model checking all the all the tools

764
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:43,980
that you have developed that you have

765
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,520
learned to use in looking at normal code

766
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,740
directly apply also to Smart contracts

767
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,840
so what are you waiting for develop the

768
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,580
next generation of tools for this what

769
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,679
we have right now is not good enough

770
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,559
okay so really I think that there is

771
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,360
green pasture here you don't have to

772
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,399
like the blockchain you can you can

773
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,980
think it total or it's the best

774
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,260
thing since sliced bread we don't care

775
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,539
but there is an opportunity here to do

776
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,399
some real interesting work from the

777
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:12,779
research point of view

778
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,899
also we need more people to look looking

779
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,700
at smart contract I think they're

780
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,640
compared to the amount of money that

781
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,980
there is at stake the group of people

782
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,840
that are looking at this stuff is very

783
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,600
small we need a lot more people doing

784
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,140
this job and we also need a way to stop

785
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,320
this heists we need a way to you know

786
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,980
stop the stop the steal if you want I

787
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,960
know it it's not exactly what you want

788
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,440
to hear from me but it's an inside us

789
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,720
joke they stop the steel is the Donald

790
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,399
Trump you know the election didn't

791
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,039
happen thing

792
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,500
so for example a Stanford researcher

793
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,299
danbone amazing guy uh recently uh

794
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:00,360
proposed reversible tokens so tokens

795
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,700
that are like all the other tokens but

796
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,279
if people agree on we can take the time

797
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,559
back and give it back to people that

798
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,480
were stolen from so these are the things

799
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,100
that we need right now and it's really

800
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,440
important that all of you if you're

801
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,080
interested in it participated in so

802
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,440
concluding the defy ecosystem is

803
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,960
fascinating it doesn't matter if you

804
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,200
believe it or believe in it or not I

805
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,539
think the jury's out even for myself I

806
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,059
am not you know a crazy hey we have to

807
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,880
do this I just think it's a it's really

808
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,580
fun remember you remember the 90s where

809
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,179
we have you know buffer overflows and it

810
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:42,059
was cool I mean we're there we defy

811
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,340
there are these very simple things that

812
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,980
have an amazing impact but we're not

813
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,140
taking advantage of it the tools are

814
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,919
primitive and we need more experts I am

815
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,200
not even you know an expert enough to to

816
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,640
do that and I think that you guys are 20

817
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,919
times faster than me you're young and

818
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,279
full of enthusiasm please do that and

819
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,860
you know if defy becomes really the best

820
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,199
thing in the world great we're gonna be

821
