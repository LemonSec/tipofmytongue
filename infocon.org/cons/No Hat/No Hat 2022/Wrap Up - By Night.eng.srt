2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,619
beautiful obviously makes it very

3
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,660
interesting but you also know me with

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,240
interesting topics that

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,859
represent the current state of the art

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,660
of the matter so in short it is

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,580
something interesting and valid that it is the first

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,140
Cyber ​​Security conference in which I

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,119
participate so it was just a

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,000
new world and a beautiful world a

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,320
world in which I intend to participate

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,899
many more times you know people who

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,420
have different skills than yours Maybe

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,940
even a different mindset than yours That they

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,520
can give you something that some point

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
of view that maybe you hadn't faced

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
rather than maybe  some technology

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,920
that you simply didn't know I think

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,239
I'm going to read it again because

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,860
I didn't understand some of the

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,640
parents who were very

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,000
interesting very technical that I didn't

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,680
expect they were avoiding technical and

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,780
also practical now a fixed stop every

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,460
year if you like  the Cyber ​​Security

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,640
come

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,749
