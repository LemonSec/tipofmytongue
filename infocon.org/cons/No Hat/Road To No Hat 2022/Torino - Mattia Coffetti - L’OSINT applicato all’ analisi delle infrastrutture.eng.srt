1
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,020
speaking of the use of infrastructures

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,779
in particular of domains why not take

3
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:22,670
charge of these methodologies of

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,220
analysis because it may be that there

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,650
are times that you have to do

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,920
investigations on domains and host infrastructures

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,460
or other both for thirty reasons so

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,670
well test analyze everything  what is

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,500
behind an

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,850
ip address domain name to our other or even

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,180
homes djibouti so if your company

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,720
or job principal told me

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,330
to drive data buying pepper

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,820
understand how extensive infrastructure

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,290
how much internet with  who are you going to look for

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,640
points to 3 points live have analyzed

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,150
the bumps infrastructure

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,880
one of the cases the application 1 of the 19

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,170
of the positive things in this when

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,970
from the playfulness in this case is that

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,220
contact is not made with infrastructure

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,380
so a good part of the tools

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,720
used on directly  so guide

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,030
the small structure there will be

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,190
no direct interactions as in our

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,860
part of the reservoirs of ozil la  second

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,130
thing is thought an analysis will be needed to be

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,850
carried out

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,390
which however is not related to the

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,880
tempo lieutenant so it is not the infrastructure as it is

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,270
now but perhaps as it was

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,119
45 years ago if we use the classic

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,240
bale noses methods of the subdomain in the

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,280
mx depuis we will only see that  that now

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,659
so that's why there are certain sites

36
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,550
that allow you to also make

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,560
historical analysis of these data and this is

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
extremely important if you want to make

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,400
a tv gens of analysis

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,490
and cognition that is not in the same moment

41
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,190


42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,740
we are back in time

43
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,360
therefore  evident this presentation

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,120
divided into two parts the first part we

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,610
will use all the

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,880
free web based tools upon registration

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,750
the seco we will not go right on

48
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,700
the technical part seeing the classic

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,140
tools that we can use the

50
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,030
dot

51
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,050
anywhere in your

52
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,240


53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,330
favorite solution most of these tools

54
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,130
do  some things that are in common

55
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,690
with others so we will see that there will be

56
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,330
d  and the data that is also repeated in the

57
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,670
other tools but then the tool that we

58
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,709
will use will have a little piece of

59
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,260
data more this is important the analysis

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,950
of the multiple sources that were at one

61
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,480
image are complete of the thing

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,220
let's start with the first then at the end there will be

63
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,100
also a little treat related to the heat

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,930
meniscus a thing that in collaboration

65
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,440
with doctor bertoldi

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,250
back and this must leave for later

67
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,810
then

68
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,540
let's start with the first site the

69
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,389
whole presentation what we start

70
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:25,389
from the public website

71
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,420
the first one i show you and respect

72
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,500
[Music]

73
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,010
by  selves closed like

74
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,139
mac starting from a bit a stream or something

75
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,170
else that can be seen in this case here I'm

76
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,909
using libero.it for the site they didn't

77
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,489
go available marx restaurant and between

78
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,590
we see the classic data of how

79
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,349
star headquarters 10 set the first time that  was

80
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,989
last seen in 2010 and let's

81
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,900
start in the evening what resolution

82
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,930
of the host the network the screen is part

83
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,840
of nothing new

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,439
the bus at the current time quin  of italy

85
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,000
online on the high there has been a good part of the

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,370
contacts the resistant technique which in

87
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,320
any case are hidden because now with

88
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,839
speeches the speakers or in any case with

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,079
privacy a

90
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,150
large part of us are caught and this is

91
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,970
one of the strengths that we will see

92
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,229
later from the historical basis

93
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,900
I hope we manage to be a little

94
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,099
student, however, I made a mistake,

95
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,720


96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
the analysis of pickles is available here

97
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,380
without using tools or

98
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,170
dictionaries or denis bruteforce. We are

99
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,820
analyzing all the domains that are part

100
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,440
of it

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,540


102
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,090
.  'infrastructure, as you know,

103
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,580
I underline the beautiful analysis, it can be easy to

104
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,580
get the two on TV, maybe it's true, I try to

105
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,030
understand between the heels

106
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,070
what, in short, the name of any

107
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,600
subdomains, other times by touch,

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
dictionary, however, always launch

109
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,670
a request for our company here

110
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,190
instead we are analyzing everything

111
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,380
that has been collected by someone who city

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,890
same thing as our anch  and here we see that

113
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,530
there are all the

114
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,390
bmx spf and

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,390
server dns records

116
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,770
[Music]

117
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,789
among these is also therefore we see only

118
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:44,979
a part of

119
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,720
this again to imagine that

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,039
now you are making a

121
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,190
mental map and then maybe an ancient one can be

122
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,740
mapped directly on the screen

123
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,110
but let's imagine that we started

124
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,610
from an honor anyway that we are

125
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,069
gradually mapping our various not

126
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,009
the various bits and pieces of information that

127
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,830
can be super multi-spin rules

128
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,120
other than that they are giving us an overview

129
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,440
of what we are monitoring

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,919
a thing  nice as usual in the

131
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,720
reconnaissance phase in order so

132
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,229
considered in my opinion is the analysis of the

133
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,069
https certificates in the certificates

134
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,080
we can still see

135
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,849
the certificate issuance activity which many

136
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,000
times can still be an email to

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
a person's name and therefore here

138
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,219
starting to send  also in the analysis

139
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:42,319
not only of the services of the servers and

140
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,819
our in connected to this happens

141
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,460
this name but also of the  the people who

142
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,790
then if some on the other remove desert and

143
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,190
rose from the analysis of the certificates

144
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,410
here too we can see something

145
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,860
nice so here too they have

146
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,170
been collected by the bushes plus all

147
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,200
these certificates for the

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,610
fixed tps we have one

149
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,340
we will see that  however, below there is a part of

150
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,920
the host names

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,560
so in this case how much ravaldino

152
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,190
punto libro.it consumed height kg

153
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,540
whoever registered the picture registered

154
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,280
a series of other information that

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,190
perhaps a

156
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,810
normal dns analysis cannot find

157
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,760
and this is the first of  sky closes

158
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,620
the second

159
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,060
herbert suisse

160
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,480
then this here

161
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,460
goes off to the room alone starting

162
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,100
from a dindo numerous domains let's

163
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,790
go back to the other registrants such as

164
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,350
other names ial registered the

165
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,450
organizations and everything and therefore also

166
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,750
here let's understand

167
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,270
if this

168
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,730
register or something else is connected  to other

169
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,810
companies this case we are

170
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,639
analyzing italy per year other so

171
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,550
we will still see a large number of

172
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,949
names if you think  I like to instead create the

173
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,050
domain of a company that has uploaded us

174
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,280
on which we have to carry out an analysis a

175
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,800
survey we see less anyway

176
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,319
but even here we are able to map other

177
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,150
companies that perhaps through the same

178
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,389
register the same name of registrant

179
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,210
etc. have created  other luini and

180
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,379
therefore here too we

181
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,930
add little pieces to our

182
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,080
investigation

183
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,799
where an immigrant here instead begins to

184
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,870
go into the

185
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,670
investigation part which does not stop only at

186
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,880
today but also saw a little something that

187
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,350
had been recorded in the past

188
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,560
boiled monarch york therefore at inter

189
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,780
on the web it was successful  however done on

190
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,150
other data which may be of those

191
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,670
that he has seen of a now in the first case

192
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,790
the classic thing that happens to me and voices

193
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,950
first race since in

194
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,470
nico's bois you point all the

195
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,680
personal information and in the obfuscated state

196
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,510
almost managed to see it instead  let's

197
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,400
see that following the latest

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
update here we can keep the

199
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,120
name of the person who registered

200
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,400
domain and here  then also this year they

201
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,680
begin to identify no longer on the

202
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,870
systems

203
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,870
but also on the connected people

204
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,450
in particular and

205
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,520
the historical bulls for example I will give a

206
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,920
practical example during a

207
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,760
three-step competition it happened that

208
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,020
we had to investigate the name of these he

209
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,370
did not say here that the  press say a

210
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,000
disappeared for months anyway and that I

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,209
found this

212
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,399
site which is one of his activities in the past

213
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,829
problem this site the expired so

214
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,600
it had not been renewed and the other not to be

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,350
reviewed bulls there was cassi complex of

216
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,199
bought di mineo top

217
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:09,579
going on  site have instead always

218
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,920
managed to go back to years

219
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,170
before when the name

220
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,429
of the person was indicated but also the

221
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:17,439
housing service and this was an

222
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,879
important slice because it sanctioned the

223
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,420
building of his home via health care this is the

224
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,589
data which was this beautiful  a

225
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,499
few points as well as helping to

226
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,029
find again even if I write this

227
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,480
girl

228
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,219
let's go on like

229
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:44,170
this framework this here no hours

230
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,339
slide class  and you already know it is a

231
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,929
container of all the famous friends sites

232
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,809
divided by category that concern

233
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:58,389
a sinuous one that can go from the

234
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,509
analysis of metadata

235
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,040
terrorism on transport

236
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,999
therefore speech from this aerial speech

237
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,740
doctors to internal

238
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,439
telephone numbers social number of this one

239
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,389
good a starting piece when

240
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,199
maybe we have to do the investigation on a

241
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,880
theme

242
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,700
an area and he doesn't know yet maybe not

243
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,710
damon has explored we have to do

244
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,360
our tour boss to start

245
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,980
similar to the first one we saw

246
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,210
that it was from sky more if chances

247
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,740
this too  here in similar mirror

248
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,360
therefore it allows us to do the analysis of the

249
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,500
ssl certificates to pull together a

250
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,800
flood of data

251
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,890
and in addition to this some banner born site friends

252
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,400


253
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,070
which also includes the domain in the nile

254
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,380
of the person who maybe gets possession

255
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,050
of this site  another

256
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,420
extract practically from the chapters page

257
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,530


258
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,870
also here we can still see

259
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,440
part of the

260
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,430
part of the ssl

261
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,829
and ad certificates  straight

262
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,939
this is a test that we can do

263
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,270
if we use this yes

264
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,570
search string service irs certificates di

265
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,779
studi libro.it

266
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,940
we see that even of the various subdomains

267
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,900
dave the host of libero gives us the e-mail address

268
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,810
of the person who posted

269
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,760
this certificate and  that therefore

270
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,130
reassured city therefore they arrived

271
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,839
anyway earlier and prepare a

272
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,420
tall clean man here instead we are

273
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,880
also actually recovering

274
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,050
thousands of

275
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,930
people what do we need this for besides mapping the

276
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,990
whole group of people anyway one

277
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,710
of entities connected to this domain

278
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,120
you know better  therefore we can

279
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,420
use day camps to see if

280
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,920
this person is registered in other

281
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,730
sites if other data in other companies

282
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,310
etc. however we have identified won

283
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,500
the day

284
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,390
usually also identifying

285
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,870
the initiative of a month first person

286
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,990
from the site and here of the

287
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,120
company and therefore  not only

288
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,880
rizzi's classics out of use else

289
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,810
we can also understand the template for

290
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,330
creating the emails so no  n is full

291
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,510
name surname and first name and

292
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,820
initial surname or something else we need this thing

293
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,830


294
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,000
if we are leaving maybe we

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,920
need to identify if another

296
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,990
person has contact with this company

297
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,300
here is part of this company or something else

298
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,980
has not found it on the internet  on

299
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,529
linkedin, for example,

300
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,640
simply approving by

301
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,420
smtp, seeing if you need to answer

302
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,690
even 15 shores by saying some people's

303
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,550
name and surname exist in

304
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,800
our database and we know that this

305
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,510
person could be part of that

306
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,459
company or in any case contacts that this

307
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,830
thing here  even if we started on

308
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,880
Monday another person

309
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,630
after our went into detail but as

310
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,720
you can see I'm keen to show even part

311
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
of the nfp the location of services open

312
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,750
to everyone understand about yes

313
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,180
but I'm a little bit from now on the

314
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,769
survey quite serious  For

315
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,220
example,

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,420
Russi is another site that can give

317
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,079
you

318
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,389
the historic month of the domain in this case, so

319
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,470
let's go to libero.it and

320
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,449
click on chaos  at the bottom

321
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,270


322
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,520
we will see that here we have a series of

323
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,220
data that did not previously appear in

324
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,050
both of the sites that we have seen

325
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,140
not even in the other initial one where they

326
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,750
identified the person here and no one

327
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,860
buys data and moreover with the date on

328
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,640
which  we have been accused

329
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,180
before

330
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,900
same speech in the plis

331
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,290
we can do it other dns records

332
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,960
so going on dns history we see

333
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,080
that on the book all of us are see

334
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,770
now by nxp

335
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,300
rule come on all the rest of this

336
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,590
moment here instead there are all those

337
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,810
who have been analyzed by  how much

338
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,840
this summarized analyze them in

339
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,150
particular with all the dates on which

340
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,460
they were detected so even then

341
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,440
we can do an analysis of the back

342
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,340
I say and the infrastructure evolves it has

343
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,070
been modified other since for

344
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,770
example liberalized liso

345
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,590
a single record of the mix has begun  which then

346
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:31,400
gradually resumed 12 46 adding

347
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:38,059
everything

348
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,080
that can help us in the analysis of

349
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,490
subdomains and dns damster in this case

350
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,660
that this  a we will

351
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,010
always find data i see

352
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,960
same

353
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,839
dns server itx of records but we see

354
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,029
there is no couple more here the status of

355
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:03,480
fashion though pf indeed google

356
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,589
inspiration of google

357
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,810
this is a graphical representation

358
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,619
of beijing

359
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,449
the thing  beautiful of this site and that there

360
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,349
will be it will give us a created map of the

361
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,510
superstructure analyzed by

362
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,140
disposable dyes so there is an understanding to do

363
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,760
what we should do with the morning

364
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,890
that is our tool to understand

365
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,770
what is behind all this this

366
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,230
Monday  domain

367
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,790
even which

368
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,360
free internal sql server or other have come out

369
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,090
so maybe they would have

370
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,760
needed a little more in-

371
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,160
depth manual investigation to get there we

372
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,140
found ourselves already well mapped various relationships

373
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,010
or other

374
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,149
surely this event vaio

375
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,168
after this

376
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,440
other site that there can be  help to

377
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,009
understand the relationships with the host of

378
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,919
nas is having how the site was created

379
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:27,970


380
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,759
do you want to know if they are inside and in

381
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,850
particular the mods  bulls averse to the best

382
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,889
thing he is using as number of

383
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:41,230
s the first because it is multi life

384
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,110
this in which he simply analyzes

385
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,330
by analyzing the

386
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,850
source code of the pages with which cms

387
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,059
was made the two servers that responds

388
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,769
something is being used the crisis  of

389
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,190
fair as new band itself has a

390
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,389
task tracker other is using google

391
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,470
public safety of we know they are tv

392
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,960
of google services in dissent to

393
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,020
do the advertising part

394
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,120
and more

395
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,770
in particular by google

396
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,110
adsense

397
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,669
we will see why it will be important later

398
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,679
because also  these people were to

399
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,870
trace the relationship between this

400
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,210
company and any other companies that

401
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,700
maybe now we have not identified

402
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,260
with this general domain

403
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,940
al qaida thorium

404
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,990
a belt i was whatever you want to call

405
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,149
it we talked about it before it is exactly

406
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,600
what we feared with

407
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,179
lewis historical records and now what else

408
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,029
we see precisely on the weight so we go out to

409
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,039
see not so much the current status of the

410
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,140
site or domain  that maybe an

411
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,870
expired page has been renewed or something else

412
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,299
but its evolution over the

413
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,330
years

414
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,860
so for example maximus are

415
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,200
book pages for 14 June 2006 at 41 having

416
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,350
proposed 6 snapshots that day we

417
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,250
see them that apart from this

418
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,889
slightly old feeling we manage

419
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,059
however identify

420
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
ok

421
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,010
not so much as ravasin has once the

422
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,070
news and believed but even here

423
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,150
possibly some companies had

424
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,950
exposed themselves to grasp his

425
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,240
company name

426
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,400
the contacts he had the times that maybe

427
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,590
have changed have been removed or other

428
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,220
and this for a serene and  therefore it is a

429
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,140
very extensive mine of information

430
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,090
let's go back to the first speech google

431
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,630
analytics this because

432
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,840
analysis of this therefore allows you to

433
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,799
insert the trek with coutinho

434
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,159
or side and always identify

435
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,369
through open ended through second

436
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,889
which other sites are using

437
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:13,860
this free this tracking this which is

438
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,440
not  allows you to do in certain cases to

439
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,899
identify which web agency has you

440
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,869
made the site made the other sites

441
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:23,429
but in the case of a company maybe that

442
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,129
develops from another site it allows us

443
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,289
to identify

444
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,720
other companies social names that are

445
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,419
using the same analysis code

446
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,379
for google

447
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,869
google analytics and possibly if I

448
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,539
'm not mistaken in the preparations  sense here we see

449
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,600
more book for example used some

450
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,450
ends with 76

451
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,840
also used on three others

452
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,909
in this case it is the only tool that

453
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:56,669
replenishes the partial results not for a

454
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,039
fee however there may be some

455
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,789
female athletes reason is my my concern to

456
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,419
show you also  this technique of

457
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,580
samo reverse search any

458
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,310
the connected to this domain

459
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,280
let's go on

460
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,510
ok now let's move on to the part

461
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,700
of analysis using command line tools

462
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,590


463
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,140
the first and hamas now let's pass

464
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,420
these tools here we don't know how to give

465
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,480
ourselves more appropriate to a third party silvio  parts

466
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,850
as before from open sources but

467
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,800
actually have an impact on

468
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,900
an infrastructure, therefore usual speech

469
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,120
pn framework or if it

470
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,610
is a judge if we have mandates here we

471
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,560
cannot touch

472
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,720
infrastructure management this is not the

473
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,580
first the first choice to make

474
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,740
[Music]

475
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,810
however let's start with the nas which in

476
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,970
this case here to allow us to do

477
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,630
the analysis of different conditions

478
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,480
so now you dominate

479
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,360
passively here in this case so still use

480
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,180


481
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,190
the

482
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,440
side database to try to modify

483
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,270
without going directly to the

484
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,310
unitary infrastructure

485
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,320


486
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,030
so what is the possibility saab recommend so

487
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,530
command if but

488
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,339
here they are

489
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,979
we see that we found

490
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,989
through this too I am taken by

491
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:02,279
passive questioning therefore by

492
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,889
contacting directly lost but through

493
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:08,649
the names on the left you see

494
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:11,889
blister happy fan I agree other we are

495
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,599
questioning others similar the only

496
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,940
case however we see that we have already

497
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,399
found the series the subdomains in this

498
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,239
case here I think how much

499
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,859
book allowed registration  of

500
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:24,719
sites

501
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:28,959
are said to pedal goods user data

502
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,109
latera la tempes  ta of times gone by

503
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,969
we found another series so

504
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:37,709
sunday aired another another

505
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,749
still pine photo in this

506
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,920
case using joker

507
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,410
dot allows you to identify not

508
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,550
only under saying by means of other but

509
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,040
also of which ones that are present

510
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,830
all  'inside the page what is the

511
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,929
community of our being records

512
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,700
for example here but extracted directly

513
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,580
to 33 records

514
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,570
tixi and 34 domains of addresses

515
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,690
internal links therefore steps are moved

516
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,750
not only from the analysis of the records but

517
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,180
also of the links of this phase  from here

518
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,599
[Applause]

519
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,760
in particular this painter of the

520
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,700
hips how many other data can he

521
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,130
therefore find in which series

522
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,980
the new inspiration for interior instincts

523
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,050
all the various writings uses the

subdomains

525
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,580
and also any files that are

526
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,460
present for example also on the subject we will

527
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,290
take later  because we will see

528
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,450
how freely downloadable files found within a

529
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,370
domain

530
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,020
can be

531
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,450
extracted in bulk and used for

532
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,110
analysis

533
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,760
tls types track  I'm not ok but then

534
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:28,090
another one who does a series

535
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,610
of things also this allows

536
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,430
us to distract from what we

537
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,670
have seen before with my big

538
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,890
bags yes

539
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,550
external terms

540
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,380
this that even the loop that joins

541
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,409
in the default maps cannot be

542
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,870
also see the doors even if it is therefore not

543
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,540
ours

544
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,080
[Applause]

545
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,960
in our case the investigation we talk about

546
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,519
them however soon we believe

547
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,880
wars cloudflare another that makes us

548
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,419
the common extraction the

549
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,210
the tool we have seen previously

550
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,490
in which each

551
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,480
each file contains various data

552
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,220
which we see part of the records

553
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,760
I saw before

554
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,600
here we see box of

555
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:31,029
course here too I see

556
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,519
an instrument made a bit of what

557
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,529
the other was doing adds a little bit

558
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,259
we gave less between my idea is

559
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:42,349
that on the basis of the cases  that you have visible

560
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:45,169
already there to see then what is so finished

561
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:49,179
results in your best environment

562
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,280
for the speech instead

563
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,630
of identifying mail or other in this

564
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,910
case here also in this case via of

565
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,440
col  ester theater his name

566
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,660
can see that in this case

567
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,190
the Swiss are here he is not the arm

568
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,490
so he is looking for this case the

569
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,210

[Music  ]

588
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,940
yes

589
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,269
2

590
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,929
ok

591
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,509
going back instead to the tools that

592
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:27,799
cost to be performed from the

593
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,809
command line or even online by marking

594
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,120
concludes I can also from one of the most

595
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,370
complete you can also interface with

596
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:38,330
abidal who felt everything from a shoulder

597
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,389
[Music]

598
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:44,779
in this case we mean an analysis  already

599
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,419
made on spike from spider food that

600
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,639
the disability of the novel but yes you can

601
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:52,100
then redeem yourself so at least in this

602
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,350
case I'm using its shortcomings

603
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,350
of the hijacking is s  tata the team

604
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,200
closed at the same

605
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,049
and can see that he found the 4,723

606
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,730
tactics at the site of the end this

607
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,009
domain of which 3,800 are enemies

608
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,899
of that most are

609
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:14,289
online identity leader projects

610
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:19,179
certificates and web protocols

611
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,360
this here in my opinion if you want to

612
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,879
use a tool  that it's a

613
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,159
little bit of a framework that does many

614
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,620
things together

615
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,809
and 1 of those

616
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,639
helped me of the most common served

617
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:35,400
so yes

618
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,580
[Music]

619
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,720
knows because if we see

620
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,360
what david tried to

621
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,700
give us an indicator of the risk of

622
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,970
any Calabrian results and it is  also excellent

623
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,299
for finding the addresses

624
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:55,880
linked to this video we see that when

625
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,150
they arrived quite a few

626
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,220
and the nice thing and that already

627
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,270
in its search

628
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,510
forwards other divas present

629
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:20,730
the usernames it found on social networks that

630
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,260
are the same age

631
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,010
as this one  know

632
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,240
yes yes

633
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,780
no

634
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,880
and the first band of

635
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,980
babel also this here set a saab the

636
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,000
jump another let's see what he did

637
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,700
a little credit and science

638
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,889
victor ques  whether or not it is that they were

639
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:49,590
monitoring on which they had found

640
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,720
effective some references to libero.it

641
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,450
automobile by sealand they had your

642
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,480
book which are

643
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,629
part of this which I say on the left you

644
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,960
can see therefore it can also be useful

645
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,610
when we also have to understand

646
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,549
the  'exposition of grisi leader or

647
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:13,830
any data that has been linked

648
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,640
the last nice thing before going

649
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,910
on the collaboration with

650
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,910
bertogli

651
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,410
no

652
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,460
here are shops for the other not on the

653
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,190
premier side who are developing a

654
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,760
city to start a bar very similar to

655
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,560
skype

656
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,330
at the moment i still haven't found so

657
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,500
many plugins or transports negative to

658
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,470
render

659
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,150
to do it in person to render really

660
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,060
useful in my opinion because i structured

661
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,080
languages

662
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,750
a one of the tools to say

663
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,409
before we said these

664
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:13,860
tools can help us also identify the

665
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,700
files we need to find it

666
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,950
identify files pdf word documents

667
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,950
we have seen things here we have two

668
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,600
half funny tools from them exit

669
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,880
pool pays for it  the climate allows us to

670
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,509
screen all the files in these cases

671
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,679
so dfx and the doc protect by

672
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,899
the domain because then what we will do we

673
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,960
will use the exit pool then the various

674
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,649
filters or other to go extract the

675
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:52,409
metadata contained within these

676
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,470
do  here therefore the name of the creator of

677
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,110
the software for the

678
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,659
particular find the

679
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:02,700
machine documents must be pulled well in the house or even

680
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,130
the inter the gps coordinates for the

681
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,710


682
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,010
sepe design part we found exif data

683
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:15,130
and we see that in this case

684
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,560
I don't remember here I don't  'I did up to the book

685
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,310
punto.it but also on another domain

686
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,190
so much smaller limited however

687
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,190
let's get to the data you found

688
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,949
they are not bad so we are identifying

689
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:33,600
the software that was used

690
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,199
to create these documents

691
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,800
the various feel a possible

692
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,520
used numbers but above all

693
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,219
rino gandini has now been identified

694
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,800
any connected people

695
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,980
the simple identification of some sails and

696
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,469
here instead they are identifying the name  and

697
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,160
user of the pc from which these people

698
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,130
acted on these online files so they are

699
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,170
already beyond the question of infrastructures they

700
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,630
are sacred data they can help us to

701
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,230
triangulate or understand here too how

702
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,380


703
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,750
these sculptures are created in a garment of terni

704
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,150
which went online also  from here

705
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,820
in case if we want to understand it is

706
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,430
structured with the brief we can go

707
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,120
to the various link sites and see if these

708
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,340
usernames have associated mings and

709
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,990
then try maybe which one can

710
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,210
express not even a step that has already been

711
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,270
identified to try to enter or

712
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,090
understand here too  the tools that this

713
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,820
person is using on which peter that

714
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,770
perhaps by giving a user we have already

715
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,050
identified also what is the name of the

716
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,380
pressure

717
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,390
perhaps to carry out a phishing attack

718
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,250
knowing that

719
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,250
one of these software paintings that we are

720
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,290
the last of life on a body with

721
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,070
the  absent roma

722
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,180
believes and

723
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,260
we've gotten quite a bit of

724
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,140
information here as well that can

725
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,680
use our will like it

726
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,850
as a  we then have all this

727
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,900
information that we have identified

728
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,650
in the tools that you prefer relative

729
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,390
i.e. it is not that when fiscal mud

730
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,390
to download an asset all of it is

731
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,190
initiated in the transforms started in the middle

732
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,860
of the automatic private individuals started

733
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,110
outside a series of data for which you have

734
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,240
number of  information especially with

735
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,470
large data so

736
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,110
in my opinion it is my first it is one of the

737
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,390
methods to see certain information but

738
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,670
I prefer the part that the spinals as

739
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,770
you can see that the free one

740
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,700
can also be used commercial quaestor

741
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,490
that allows you to trace all the

742
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,030
connections  among the dunes of host people

743
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,830
in this case here and he saw me and is

744
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,680
connecting book.it love forced

745
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,370
below I put other records

746
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,770
made to our map without

747
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,610
automatisms but by mapping

748
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,120
graphically all

749
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,480
receive information that there are

750
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,740
significant results from the game  and already

751
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,840
president we have therefore made

752
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,060
an idea unmapped map  all of you and then

753
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,830
try to understand the interactions

754
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,680
however we will not leave software in terms of

755
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,450
mapping everything and then from going to

756
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,340
dozens of its various forms because in

757
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,350
my opinion at least for how

758
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,210
[Music]

759
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,050
last thing

760
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,230
in the case

761
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,190
[Music]

762
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,350
now

763
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,070
in particular field  the last if

764
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,630
we have to understand how to protect

765
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,940
the infrastructure can understand the risks that

766
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,880
this road is running out and that

767
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,920
of the oranges that can be done and

768
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,200
that south squatting or

769
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,260
domain registrations with numbers

770
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,450
words

771
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,390
political sounds similar to the domain we

772
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,670
are seeing that we are  analyzing

773
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,270
that they can then be used for

774
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,770
phishing attempts trying to make people

775
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,400
understand by

776
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,860
screening gunnar and making the person

777
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,620
who complains which arrives in any files

778
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,289
or other and of the site that we are the

779
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:49,079
one of the tuf apart but

780
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,039
job was changed and one on the  r4

781
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,039
to do the reconnaissance

782
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,019
part here too

783
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:03,269
there is a tool called that can

784
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:06,239
be seen in this case and

785
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,630
used two  ways one to understand

786
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,259
which domains that have these rules that

787
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,029
can be used in rigoni in

788
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,660
the shake park have already been registered and

789
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,369
therefore maybe block them within

790
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:22,779
the now I said sure we are

791
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:26,799
analyzing can actually in the case

792
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:29,739
of a foreign priest adro see what they

793
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,469
are  it is possible to generate that could

794
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:34,570
deceive the end user

795
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,270
the case of phishing or other in this

796
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,000
case I have used the summit to

797
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,830
see donations that have already been

798
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,950
registered

799
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,850
so you will see that

800
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,260
now he is calculating all his

801
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,850
presentations and events top

802
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,550
left

803
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,200
inaccurate

804
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,580
latina  34 seconds

805
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,540
these are the sites that inspired the

806
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,820
cookies because they have been

807
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,090
registered

808
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,880

809
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,490
to syria in things and by

810
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,680
re-entering none of these possible here

811
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,220
I can reveal the ending is and associative

812
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,520
of the attacks of the alleys

813
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,950
to this we arrive at the  little thing

814
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,410
he found alessandro bertoldi said to

815
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:41,310
say never had this serious sotis a

816
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,310
65 usually the stage stalking name scotti

817
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,680
that you use lett numbers that

818
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,520
look like however almost what to say a

819
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,720
difference if not for certain they say

820
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,540
whose name was some Russian characters and or

821
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,020
other the other policy which however have

822
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,160
been banned

823
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,830
in the long distraction at least from the

824
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,990
in the  european other comerio then

825
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,880
register cards only with that

826
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,140
policy or registers with the policy

827
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,750
now let's see normal

828
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,920
the only thing was found by him

829
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,410
a vulnerability a real bar

830
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,220
but an attack vector that office 365

831
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,390
if you eat an email from  a dns that is

832
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,150
registered from a forward domain

833
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,180
with capital letters he doesn't make a

834
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,580
lake of a new arcade of characters

835
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,740
when

836
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,140
these things arrive it means

837
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,060
thought the n is also mine how many times have

838
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,370
you not figured out which title

839
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,320
maybe the  re money in the duty between

840
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,850
writing something on the dot I'm going to

841
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,030
copy paste

842
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,890


843
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,240
aside coincidentally the domain of the

844
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,200
company in the company where I work lost the job

845
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,150


846
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,190
ndata fits very well to make these

847
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,760
attack texts

848
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,840
so what happens the domain

849
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,290
of the work company you

850
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,230
need security it's called person went

851
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,450
online

852
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,870
I registered the domain towards a given

853
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,080
point.it therefore where of assistance here

854
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,280
stf record registered

855
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,800
therefore from a hymn it results  as spam with

856
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,220
by nadia tomalino what else happens to me

857
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,120
but me forever as lost a capital letter

858
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,620
date is identical as you can see here he lost

859
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,860
a hand in this case a mail to first

860
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,320
is that for now we have not found an

861
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,120
artist or office 365 himself who could

862
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,810
identify this is all the jury of

863
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,840
children will be dino

864
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,829
and therefore nothing

865
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,559
the final gem linked to overcooked factors

866
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:06,079
has spent them

867
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,660
it seemed nice to present a repeat

868
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,309
the gimmick alessandro bertoldi in

869
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:13,680
you can yourself nor the sea is a

870
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,140
small thing but

871
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,359
as of sites also having the  time has

872
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,479


873
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:23,930
passed by anti spam

874
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,219
paralyzing

875
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:28,380
park analysis scott hicks focuses on the

876
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,719
classics uncle capital d  re associated along

877
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,150
that the boulders uppercase and lowercase characters

878
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,099


879
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,999
we actually didn't find in the

880
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:41,279
controls and designers so

881
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:44,570
difficult attack for the Florentine is a

882
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,010
criticized

883
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,240
[Applause]

884
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,840
via I finished I hope

885
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,980
