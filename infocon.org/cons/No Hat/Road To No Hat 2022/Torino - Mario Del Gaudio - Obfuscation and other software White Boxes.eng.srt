00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,619
this blog will be shorter than

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,100
animated a little more than the anus

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,590
mainly from the back of the analysts

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,040
is the box of white box understood as

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,419
anything that we can analyze

6
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,840
understand the functioning

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,790
or even alterable

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,460
a white box is because large is precisely the

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,920
system  can be analyzed and is

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
however what the call of the program

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,830
the source code

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,360
the hardware we can pay with

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,500
incite then read the memory

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,150
something

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,550
to finish when code bought

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,170
because even if it was more like before

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,760
it runs on our city so

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,090
we manage to stick a  device

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,850
read like pedis assemble it we can

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,630
make it like this

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,060
the product the game was

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,259
mainly used in these

23
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,210
quasi-products that the state them therefore

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,119
of licensing weapons therefore software which

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:26,890
is

26
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,750
commercial software

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,219
that wants to protect there are no

28
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:34,640
licenses to actually succeed in

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,909
make malware software to make

30
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,270


31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,620
a view a ri  seeker can not

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,480
easily understand the functioning

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,720
of the malware

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,030
internal techniques of the malware or

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,830
mainly make sure that the virus

36
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,510
can not make fun

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,740
very easily

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,720
also proprietary algorithms can be protected

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,450
in this way thinking for

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,000
example photoshop with all the bulk

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,240
of the images that  know

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,620
why you have the algorithms are fixed

43
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,080
because not very good also reiterated

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,380
assemble them understand what they do

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,420
without resistive but you can make a

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,540
competitor do it anyone home

47
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,000
moreover

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,770
traditional this plus a bit different

49
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,920
the actress obscured the sen but still

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,239
like in the pits because they

51
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,320
are programs that  they run on computers

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,080
in any

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,610
normal computer so we can start

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,070
paying etc.

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,410
[Music]

56
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,360
the first part of the operation starting

57
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,140
from the hull machine code will

58
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,820
explain the techniques that can be

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,520
used take able to

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,170
on the complicated and let's say you understand little

61
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,300
mainly encoding small will talk

62
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,660
tomorrow  because what

63
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,740
mario does we'll get there later he becomes a

64
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,520
cyclist i make a toothpaste machine is

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,010
in general increase the danger

66
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,700
when we put everything in a feeling so

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,140
look for that etcetera etcetera

68
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,290
a transformation of the program

69
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,830
takes it morandi readable so that

70
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,300
the analysis cannot be done  static

71
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,770
directly on the whites for program

72
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,590
then a description and the father as

73
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,710
at etc

74
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,110
to have a lot of executable code

75
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,790
that a credible one

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,960
works about so we have

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,540
the fiction team but here we love the

78
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,930
dough of a program or a new

79
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,450


80
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,820
working readable code will become some

81
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,120
code  encrypted

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,890
it is stuck to it formula a staff

83
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,740
that actually is code we

84
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,850
read satisfied it is a forgery that

85
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,470
take your search and know after 10

86
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,209
do it and

87
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,130
[Applause]

88
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,200
this thing can be circumvented from the point of

89
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,620
view of fat giners

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,500
following the sad fetish in a way  let it

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,420
be decided to stick out thirty years of

92
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,410
pain die the clean code here  of

93
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,660
this it

94
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,419
is not so much a technique that sage

95
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,130
making tends to suggest is more

96
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,389
difficult but in the face of

97
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,770
automatic tools they cannot

98
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,210
to the point of the static crisis determine the

99
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,380
functioning of the program without pin

100
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,600
etc.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,620
the second technique

102
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,630
I make the renditions a little more complex

103
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,930
but at the base there is

104
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,900
a super setting the same

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,120
each function is encrypted and is

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,789
quoted on the fly when it was not there it is

107
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,729
called with a grandson function which

108
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,280
is a

109
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,660
rush first we call you the function the

110
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,689
function calls fiction sat

111
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:38,029
here now the script of  code that is

112
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,119
ever big difficulty and

113
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,819
what is enough to know that this function

114
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,610
here

115
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,319
executes it takes the sides that will be a

116
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,069
picciotto the iran eligible again it is

117
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,379
executed

118
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,709
when it has finished throwing it away and come

119
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:59,679
back after this because

120
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,328
this causes the

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,249
whole program

122
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,039
throughout the network for the anci there is not

123
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,009
always an encrypted code so for

124
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,169
example if I'm looking for the functions

125
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:16,599
f1 and f2

126
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,429
I'm going to use the function  ionization of the

127
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,199
program I can read the code of

128
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,339
those two but not of f3 f4

129
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:29,360
maybe sent class 3 d with is to make

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,279
sure that it is said that I can't

131
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,229
open the program print the memory

132
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,899
read the code

133
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,779
this is more trite enough

134
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,589
to get around

135
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:42,559
you have to  write a but because it does

136
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:45,080
that for each single one talks about putting it

137
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,508
together it's possible but it's not

138
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,310
the most difficult thing to give

139
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,110
them creating only the restore machines

140
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,440
there are classes of green information that

141
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,630
this is not intended as

142
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,230
the box envisaged  loads us or riso kinks and or a

143
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,570
computer of the power of attorney for seen at the

144
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,180
machine here I intend to

145
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,870
have alternative machine code

146
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,430
happily but even if his name is mike

147
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,380
todd

148
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,750
we define instructions we give him

149
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,260
completed bytes and then we implement a

150
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,900
fiction example destruction we seize

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,990
so that  my functions will be

152
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,290
composed of of custom which is a

153
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,130
traverse around he doesn't know what they do in flowers he

154
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,910
has to go and figure out who but each of

155
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,550
those cases  what

156
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,460
in short in

157
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,310
fact moment explained it can be

158
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,570
compact premium about what education

159
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,080
corresponds to now i here have

160
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,319
raised also i am very basic with the

161
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,349
institutions but no one forbids

162
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,680
doing education which is a partner a

163
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,900
whole function for a style in the city

164
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,439
we have  to hurt

165
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,710
so summarizing trust and ginny

166
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,330
high careers at every single instruction

167
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,909
lowers to mention

168
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,159
the homeland of skiing

169
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,219
the diagram here shows a way to

170
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,789
interpreted so we have the code in

171
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,578
my bowl voltages interpreter makes

172
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,440
first switch for each section

173

for actually it is the most complex thing it

adds complexity from the code

205
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,020
so let's not actually

206
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,790
hide it accepts some jeans and

207
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,020
but adds to the overall offices

prevent that is the code is not

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,150
one hundred percent secure  which is the

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,840
are more complex instructions less

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,060
know abyss less we add

some useful Belgians that are never

performed if two

225
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,140
useful calculations could  be

226
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,190
simplified arrangement only maybe period

227
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,820
there are several

228
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,550
there are infinite ways to do this

229
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,699


230
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,470
thing a very common thing they are pop

231
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,200
predicated made

232
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,640
only by the expressions they

233
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,460
always take followed by the evaluated but they

234
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,320
literally have only one possibility for

235
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,140
example here we have trench coats one of the

236
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,490
two  it will always go on the left branch b

237
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,010
the whole football interesting on right radio

238
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,240


239
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,880
this combined with the network wines of

240
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,250
the environmental code exhibited to the

241
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,740
judges overall adds a faction

242
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,310
of code that if we have to go there to

243
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,469
understand what causes one thing to be canceled

244
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,900
also a  bit more complex

245
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,040
lot of fan cod

246
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,740
and about related 3d de  dicato pati

247
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,030
is a bit different the code can modify

248
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,890
itself and some code somewhere else

249
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,890
in the program

250
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,680
so if I confirm it the book will let

251
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,130
me be good it does something but

252
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,290
certainly not for which they followed a completely different

253
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,210
code

254
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,510
here it's done in  so that the static analysis

255
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,220
is more difficult not impossible

256
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,940
I assure news even when emulating

257
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,320
the policy of the thumb but it is not bad

258
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,140
in the code choice diagram than a

259
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,450
visit to itself based on the result

260
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,430
of one of those principles

261
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,670
so instead of all that it  it

262
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,460
could be done with a fixed code which

263
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,089
never means maybe longer but with

264
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,630
more body basically more port

265
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,980
however to reach the overall

266
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,080
easily for codes to change

267
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,420
exactly the same thing applies however it is more

268
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,380
difficult to understand what to do

269
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,800
with this I conclude the first category

270
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,390
the first  part of this times so

271
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,240
just look at the whipped machine code

272
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,160


273
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,500
now we have milk that owes on the br

274
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,490
indeed something that is aut  or to the pits so

275
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,920
what we're going to do is take an

276
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,180
algorithm like the as symmetric key

277
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,750
we want to make sure that

278
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,780
the arrivals in video for example I think

279
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,660
that mike phillips when sending a film

280
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,970
they make us so that it can't be

281
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,110
taken and copied that  we miss it, however, for one

282
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,670
reason or another we don't want to give

283
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,880
the symmetric key into the hands of those who

284
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
watch the film what happens because

285
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,990
through the career

286
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,910
the code of the original algorithm is

287
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,880
transformed this is this code here

288
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,180
at the key is a nice  from morelli not

289
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,910
pouring winners

290
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,190
somewhere in the sense that all

291
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,700
these instructions make it

292
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,910
his home

293
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,400
if we put the key an original

294
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,850
we have the

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,300
same traffic very holy

296
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,650
so we don't have the key as in

297
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,630
progress the key is actually not

298
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,850
trivial

299
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,510
there are actually some cryptographic attacks to be recovered

300
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,130
that I don't use the excuse

301
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,350
that they are poor mathematics but it

302
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,440
can actually be done it is useless now

303
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,230
derut  what did I do with the

304
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,690
considerations at home there is a

305
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,750
molecule tarpaulin hiding a key the

306
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,970
answer is

307
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,200
great a little more difficult than the

308
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,560
dedication from the content

309
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,630
an attacker cannot 3 ferrara from the

310
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,380
code because lotte made sure that

311
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,280
the key is lost  in quotes

312
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,410
but in a certain way we know let's try and

313
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,010
try again

314
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,320
the code with which we can decipher

315
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,040
anything anyway the key

316
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,270
if taking the po has certainly

317
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,220
we remove it from the original program

318
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,840
somewhere else

319
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,210
therefore it's called drifting we go on to

320
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,910
decide anything

321
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,840
we can manipulate the  'algorithm

322
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,770
actually changing the instructions

323
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,110
because now it runs on our processor

324
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,140
it's ours that we control it

325
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,750
so in

326
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,100
this it can work it really

327
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,180
makes sense to do this it loads us in my opinion notes

328
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,300
or from 100 I made a

329
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,880
lot of lifting funds as I said before

330
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,830
let's take the code  we run

331
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,170
it somewhere else we decide

332
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:09,460
arbitration data as it is prevented past

333
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,350
p  we have been adding for some time what it offers

334
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,200
to the encryption so that only the

335
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,000
original program that at the beginning which is

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,060
designed to do when it manages

337
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,610
to take the adv content

338
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,470
then to the best netflix player in

339
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,780
addition to which it will take the content maybe

340
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,580
there is another her  knows maybe only in

341
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,190
proprietary video format and therefore only they

342
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,760
can it

343
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,860
is long this is not exactly sure

344
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,840
because as we have taken the tele code it

345
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,760
encrypts

346
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,610
the content we take the code that

347
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,190
reproduces it therefore

348
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,890
it takes longer but they can all

349
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,630
be must be used these

350
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,320
things the world cup

351
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,780
the alpha the counter paste and manipulating

352
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,000
direction went a rhythm because

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,609
we wish we could do it because maybe

354
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,920
we want

355
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,420
longo the twin sets it's still about end to the

356
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,089
original so it's different from s true

357
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,369
but there are similar things we can

358
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,709
recognize

359
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,480
we can do the new which  some

360
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,310
operations does not go in one followed

361
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,079
by no left for the other says machine

362
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,970
or talking about the

363
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,040
replacement la  from you collaborate here

364
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,720
making sure that it doesn't replace anything

365
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,230
so we get closer to the beginning of the

366
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,169
browser decrypting the passer

367
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,980
we could make it easier to

368
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,299
recover the original key

369
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,610
to tell the truth it takes too much but you

370
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,730
can do

371
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,740
the other side of the coin  is that how

372
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,510
it can be done you can make everything even more

373
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,760
difficult with a little bit all

374
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,669
honestly yes but

375
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,230
we can take a

376
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,320
replacement table is instead of putting it

377
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,450
separately separated by a bit says

378
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,669
making pieces of code become free

379
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,679
of the replacement table  so if

380
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,679
I am going to modify the stop code

381
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,940
effectively modifying the maximum of

382
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,330
the table it is

383
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,710
actually of tudin other direction

384
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,799
so I can no longer decipher with the

385
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,429
code that I have modified

386
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,620
the original content or in any case also

387
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,090
sull of beni mat and maybe they go to

388
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,710
read the table

389
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,679
substitution found later in the code

390
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,240
will act differently

391
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,799
this is not sure if public

392
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,049
memory can be parsed  are

393
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,580
all this statically but

394
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,350
as they say Italian do amos risk

395
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,320
so the passenger to impose on the

396
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,140
engineers it is a question of

397
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,730
communicating life to them they wage a bit

398
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,370
of cell war including it but shoot

399
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,230
high

400
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,870
on this too

401
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,260
so in the end why

402
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,820
do

403
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,630
something in the first place  like

404
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,970
that since at some point the content

405
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,240
the chicago is in the memory

406
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,250
controlled by us we can i am

407
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,440
playing a video on a kriens stop

408
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,780
i can do a hosting we do it a

409
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,060
place for an internship to protect but

410
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,620
i can read the memory that is

411
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,059
sent  to the screen

412
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,880
so it's not really a hundred percent secure

413
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,679


414
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,500
like all the rest of the vyrus I

415
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,480
told you about in this presentation just

416
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,700
low the point

417
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,960
so it shouldn't be a good

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,490
idea actually

419
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,799
this thing

420
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,230


421
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,429
is easy enough to do so it's easy enough to make

422
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,580
everyone  of algorithms we refer together

423
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,850
with the content to decipher it is quite

424
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,010
different to each other across the

425
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,899
materials and were  of the themes of

426
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,659
a pole first

427
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,280
so effectively for each

428
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,200
content that is added in the film the

429
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,610
library will have a

430
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,250
slightly different algorithm don't look at tominz

431
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,669
auto maybe it's therefore

432
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,010
someone who wants to be a grandfather I say to the

433
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,929
content of the parade there on the other hand

434
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,600
this makes it so  that people reject

435
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,610
that the fort of those brand new

436
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,890
film comes out but if you go to see it malandra

437
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,450
clicks this

438
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,780
we are invaded i eat wear to your

439
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,430
poor as dr

440
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,250
but the left badly let's say yes

441
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,920
sinibalda with a quarrel increase

442
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,610
enough precisely for this reason

443
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,870
so actually better to use

444
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,110
this that nothing but there are even

445
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,420
better things certainly better than this

446
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,170
is actually what is better in

447
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,880
something they can analyze

448
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,800
something that we cannot analyze

449
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,440
another it is the box below more on

450
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,560
a country was the slide given by having

451
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,810
bosque  just because gospel pigs

452
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,540
devices all newlyweds liberated

453
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,940
of computers et cetera

454
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,430
things like seduce the  club

455
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,320
of these pms in this for windows that

456
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,140
holds the key to decrypt the disk is

457
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,870
instead

458
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,460
exactly the one that will decide the disk

459
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,760
maximum a kalex and encrypts the key that

460
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,030
the disk encrypts what also happens to the

461
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,740
operating system if there are so many

462
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,340
brands that the  atp anime to decipher into

463
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,110
something

464
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,170
the pm says euro it's you then say

465
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,670
5 this time the key where does it ever come out

466
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,100
from the inside so google computer sign

467
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,240


468
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,280
the sisters in therapy i still have to

469
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,410
succeed in these di piave god i'm

470
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,559
cellared the rate of fencing  to understand it

471
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,380
was a keyword things like inter

472
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,020
management to the gene is a small

473
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,320
centimenti processor that has a

474
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,590
proprietary operating system he uses to do

475
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,100
things he says he can do so

476
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,080
the boss we don't know what just deemed

477
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,110
not to read full privileges on the

478
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,500
machine no one knows how to fish  about and

479
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,539
many other things like it

480
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,970
caught 2gb co2 a coprocessor

481
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,830
in apple computers in the last few

482
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,020
that did intel and it does a lot of c  ose

483
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,160
hardware controls of veratour and

484
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,120
brightness of a screen

485
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,150
absolute choice of the book but above all things

486
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,580
like it is exactly this thing here to

487
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,350
prohibit the wanting there are

488
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,929
proprietary morichini cuts or on top of the red

489
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:51,000
there are proprietary grinders

490
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,620
verified in cars and in there that  they

491
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,750
can go analyze me and almost

492
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,330
literally

493
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,450
a solid kharkiv

494
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,460
nuanced the pendulum machinery they

495
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,649
can't steal it from us by fernando our code

496
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:08,149
this is exactly what he used us

497
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:10,700
for the drm carry verb the

498
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,279
interplay they used from netflix is ​​used

499
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,549
to carry videos

500
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:18,340
is like

501
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,500
works tv and fanta decryption from content

502
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,700
decode and we off straight to

503
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,120
screen so video frames

504
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,950
are never in memory mind to

505
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,039
processor from system then processor

506
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,669
proceed then us

507
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,669
if they want to unplug machine fair

508
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,830
play but best thing we can do

509
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,990
