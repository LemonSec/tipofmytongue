1
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,340
ok hello everyone

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,400
owner of bertolli always my security

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,360
we started as a company

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,230
as an exercise setting up a small

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,800
data sense and therefore mail

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,339
server web server

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,320
and things above so I have had

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,600
some experience

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,290
on all these here

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,890
we have dealt with

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,790


12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,500


13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,330
basically secure e-mail so we tried

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,000
to understand how to do phishing and

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,269
how not to suffer a tie-breaker this

16
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,390
happened in 2018 so the questions we asked ourselves

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,120
was what did they come from why do

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,880
the emails come from intesa san paolo

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,910
with the intesa sanpaolo formula field and

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,030
because they can arrive and from all

21
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,710
these questions they came out

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,280
in the answers so how can you

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,070
manage to block this e-mail

24
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,830
because from the intesa sanpaolo domain it

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,100
could be done etc.

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,360
in a while on the topic from both

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,090
sides therefore from the side of those who have

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,770
to run the campaign  phishing is on the

29
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,929
side of those who must stop it

30
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,940
then surely therefore falling

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,810
even sometimes very much in the ban  ale but

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,570
I would say useless

33
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,570
ok

34
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,380
then first thing to do definitely

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,920
send an e-mail to the target and retrieve

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,800
the domain signature

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,480
possibly doing some bones

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,550
trying to figure out who works in that

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,410
company so with linkedin or

40
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,420
maybe with foo now like it costs a bit

41
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,030
caruccio before it could have been done much more

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,030
simply and try to understand the

43
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,040
criterion with which minds are built

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,080
domain then name dot surname

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,340
initial name dot surname

46
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,530
full name initial dot surname etc. and

47
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,319
so it's almost done and this thing

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,130
we put these things aside

49
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,140
done this we have to check with a

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,810
good old net hotel if the e mail

51
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,209
exists only mail server so

52
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,560
let's see if we want or if we don't want to

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,510
leave log if we want the

54
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,630
charlotte we use tales and control soc

55
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,930
that we make a call rcp you to

56
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,780
the mail server  and obviously if he

57
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,829
manages it exists the answer will be ok which

58
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,750
could go on eventually it

59
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,640
will be possible that this from the system c  he was

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,739
once used when in the middle of

61
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,780
the html column marini playtest to

62
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,209
scam emails and now it's no longer possible

63
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,850
because obviously not only so

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,079
credible

65
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,150
we did all the many years ago

66
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,639
when he claimed the email tells

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,370
our friend about bill gates and we don't c  'there were

68
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,780
still all those security systems

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,139
which were then implemented after

70
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,970
ok having

71
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,520
said that let's go through a little bit of

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,500
what we receive so we must

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,110
go analyze the

74
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,670
source of the message the role of the

75
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,710
message which gives us lots of

76
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,800
useful information including the

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,970
path of the email  from which we can

78
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,620
say that in principle we

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,060
also have the address of the mail server

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,250
things are done well the address to

81
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,420
be reposted also making it

82
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,829
lost but

83
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,750
in most cases we

84
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,690
can not get from the path we can

85
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,040
understand what is in  means then

86
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,630
any bad gateway

87
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,640
filtering services etc etc etc

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,280
because those we have to look for

89
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,350
therefore overcome legend and backwards

90
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,990


91
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,870
in the before that sorry sorry to the pro

92
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,150
when he reads us but you can do all the

93
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,620
way to do without it with all the

94
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,730
ip addresses

95
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,430
from the starting point to you obviously

96
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,560
if the server administrator is

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,710
good enough he hides skills

98
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,560
the local aid option p in rendered leaders

99
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,770
therefore on a message you don't see a

100
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,540
drizzone is needed at the starting point but

101
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,130
we are given yours and this is a

102
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,500
trick that the administrator seems

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,130
to have to do in the council to do it

104
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,960
then

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,300
display public lippi  where does it come

106
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,120
from could it be useful if the

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,300
mail server is at home to do other things for a

108
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,510
moment from from the phishing issue

109
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,890
but we go home we take

110
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,570


111
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,280
this information home too this information is another thing that

112
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,900
can be seen that can be useful loser

113
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,600
accuse i  mail client that sends

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,620
therefore between 20 places used a

115
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,290
lot of information

116
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,460
on what and how to do and how to defend

117
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,750
ourselves we find on the dns so what does it use  mo

118
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,220
bmx toolbox definitely

119
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,979
helps us the most useful information for us

120
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,039
is obviously the me hicks record which

121
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,800
tells us if there is a

122
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,780
filtering platform or not or if the aterno mail

123
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,300
directly to the mail server and then

124
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,900
go to  see three things did spf if there is

125
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,030
kimi's if there was marc's coma of mark

126
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,860
collins activated

127
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,140
here i put the related to feces in the

128
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,940
presentation so if you want you can

129
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,150
go and see everything

130
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,380
we say that the most important things are

131
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,810
spf edimar club  ichim we may not

132
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,280
always find it because kim's is a

133
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
selector so with a little imagination

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,960
the selector is found however it is not always

135
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,550
possible to find it

136
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,080
let's say that in any case if we don't

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,160
find kim's it's not a serious thing because he knows

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,880
whose it is none other than it was  below we will see

139
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,680
the signature that is placed on the emails

140
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,810
another tool that we can use

141
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,990
dns damster to see how it is made

142
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,700
cyst sorry I'm sorry that you don't

143
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,849
see it so well in the slide written

144
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,840
graphic representation  a part of the

145
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,430
mail system or not must be green

146
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,349
mail this is our

147
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,750
mail server system where you can't see it because you only see

148
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,190


149
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,820
the mail filtering system which upstream of

150
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,830
the mail server then there is a firewall and

151
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,050
then  noticed i.e. it would be placed on

152
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,580
our system so here it is not seen

153
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,460
ok very well then let's talk a bit about

154
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:19,060
these spfs of kim and mark then spf is

155
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,180
the first thing to do for everyone what

156
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,220
defines in the floods which are the

157
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,620
ip

158
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,200
authorized to send for the  domain

159
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,580
then records pf here I put a moment

160
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,910
committed my record if

161
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,480
pfv spf a includes here mta spf mta

162
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,750
ruth I include the spf of the

163
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,000
filtering system that I use for me it is the export and

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,120
then I also included spf of but the chip

165
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,390
serves tip  friends svt botnet and then he

166
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,700
put less all then let's see for a

167
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,170
moment how we can insert the

168
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,300
record of we can insert as ip4

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,240
like the more you look the more if how it remembers

170
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,670
as a mx record or we can make

171
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,370
an inclusion of a  lter spf the

172
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,860
final part which is now let's say that all the

173
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,040
records that we insert by default

174
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,550


175
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,490
take plus ie in the sense they are authorized

176
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,960
all and everything else

177
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,850
and we say what to do with everything

178
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,090
else so there is a qualifier re which

179
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,160
in this case  the least to suu kyi but

180
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,540
what does it do with everything else

181
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,150
then I

182
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,500
suggest you put less and less now

183
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,520
let's see this qualifier what it does

184
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,559
if we see it later

185
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,320
anyway I'll tell you

186
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,110
the more

187
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,039
authorized the less you can't do anything

188
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,750
the ondina a soft cell  and the

189
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,020
question mark in your

190
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,240
ok

191
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,180
here it is by kim it's another important

192
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,010
thing what does the by kim is a

193
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,839
mail authentication protocol which is used

194
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,880
to verify the authenticity of the

195
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,160
minimal outputs so there are two

196
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,630
cryptographic keys there is a private key

197
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,030
that on the server that can be

198
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,960
1024 8 bit it is a public key that

199
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,630
is put on the dns this is ours

200
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,410
from kim that is on our dns so the

201
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,290
public key can I because republic

202
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,930
no  n there is no problem

203
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,930
ok

204
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,610
here

205
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,500
the most important thing is the language that

206
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,110
the smart makes the game and the sco

207
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,860
thing which i didn't tell you

208
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,150
that it is very from a very important detail

209
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,140


210
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,120
going back to the spf the spf is basically

211
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,050
a tag that  authorize

212
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,850
the from field and time and

213
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,250
ok so

214
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,840
this is very important because if we

215
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,700
practically give on the spf

216
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,050
at least now we use those

217
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,610
addresses are those addresses of

218
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,800
can write from the from field of

219
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,810
the from field what we see on the

220
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,110
mobile phone on the mail client

221
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,550
when we read  the email and it is the one that

222
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,270
is found so spf certainly

223
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,460
in its importance kim's la is

224
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,360
important because it signs the e-mail which

225
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,300
guarantees us that the e-mail has not been

226
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,890
modified during its

227
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,000
path mark's la is important because it says what

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,840
happens if fela  spf or

229
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,200
kim's row

230
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,970
obviously the very important thing is to

231
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,760
activate the policy on the brand

232
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,290
there are some in polis and not activated by di

233
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,130
martino forte with nothing and l  apart

234
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,670
from policy more important now this

235
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,470
we will see later the of equal xvi defines

236
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,050
the policy can be king jack can be

237
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,140
quarantine can be not i advise

238
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,480
to always put regent so from my

239
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,890
parents they end up in a black hole nemesis

240
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,640
dive so if row spf things that

241
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,470
l  'ala of kim when it exits the victim

242
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,540
when another server sends for us

243
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,760
that we are not to the mail when even if

244
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,430
from the spf when it sends another server

245
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,250
that is not included in the addresses that

246
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,590
we authorized and then it was given

247
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,820
in minus all have behind all  the others

248
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,630
are not authorized therefore putting

249
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,000
the jet equal

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,770
all the mails from the destination servant

251
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,990
are

252
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,160
put in a bit like practically they don't

253
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,990
even arrive in the mailbox

254
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,950
if I say quarantine

255
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,410
obviously they come to be a spam

256
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,630
certainly even with spf less at the hotel

257
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,580
and me they end up in  spam but

258
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,890


259
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,480
this mechanism is not always in my opinion more

260
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,200
correct and safer

261
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,300
the mark can also work with spf

262
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,480
and al  among the nice thing of the dead who

263
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,310
sends us in the contact reports that is,

264
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,470
through

265
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,980
these reports rua and report roof

266
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,450
we can know who is trying to stew

267
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,960
our address

268
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,380
ok here he made a

269
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,750
drawing for a moment of how they work and inter

270
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,760
our game

271
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
the car  mail server that in the note

272
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,610
how spf works

273
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,920
you see all quite simple

274
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,080
the dns are queried and then depending there is

275
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,030
a

276
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,870
reputation database depending on

277
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,590
spf matches does not match the

278
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,710
fifteen year old emails and spam or not

279
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,590


280
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,870
kim's ok more or less  the same thing here be

281
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,970
careful that all the servers that are

282
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,260
on the path that are authorized

283
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,990
can put it by kim so the by

284
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,730
kimi i can decide to put it

285
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,500
example mail server the

286
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,940
filtering system can decide of minds

287
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,970
since i send from the mail server

288
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,950
through the  filtering system they

289
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,810
can put it by king cole

290
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,400
filtering system or they can decide to

291
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,620
put it maybe green mail me for

292
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,780
more yes  surety as you know paul

293
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,400
mail server and then we'll see why

294
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,430
ok and connect cutini understand marco's

295
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,880


296
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,440
this mark's la what it does it goes to check

297
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
everything and then as I said decides

298
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,920
what to put the receiving server

299
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,370
decides what to do with the mail that arrives

300
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,110
this  it's a very strong mechanism but between

301
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,770
pc and life itself we have stf with minus

302
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,520
all

303
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,160
we have kim's we have mar's

304
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,340
policy with the reject policy enabled

305
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,390
they can't excuse us the from field

306
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,960
which enters domain nor extra domain i.e.

307
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,120
what does this mean  that can't get

308
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,310
bored between the addresses of our

309
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,890
domain which is the most serious thing or from

310
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,660
our domain emerged stakeholders

311
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,760
because in any case everything is verified

312
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,820
on the dns

313
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,190
and let's say tons of spaces are removed

314
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,020
as sister with really

315
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,150
opposite if so without even too much

316
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,390
expense now let's go to  see what

317
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,170
how the spf record is structured i.e.

318
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,520
what happens at low value we have

319
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,340
already said

320
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,970
we can do it

321
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,920
the moment before

322
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,790
instead here is the record of mark here

323
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,670
let's take a look at the ti part

324
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,070
which is very important because the one that

325
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,280
defines the policy and many I

326
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,190
guarantee you that many companies very very

327
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,020
important so many very very important bodies

328
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,820
from policy was only on not

329
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,550
therefore non-existent because they do  la di

330
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,500
mars well surely why have it from

331
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,930
brands where the fedic medieval spy

332
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,570
increases the deliverability of

333
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,260
emails and therefore

334
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,610
email works very well

335
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,610
if we do them but why don't

336
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,180


337
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,920
many people like her make policies it was really ok

338
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,660
then we have restrictive training modes

339
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,830
here we know whose spf it is

340
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,080
let's go back for a moment the sp record is

341
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,990
used for subdomains if we don't

342
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,370
put it

343
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,590
and implicit

344
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,140
optional alignment mode a of

345
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,520
chime spf if it is we specify they apply

346
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,620
to subdomains therefore it is an

347
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,870
alignment mode  restrictive for

348
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,240
subdomains and therefore also here if

349
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,970
we go to give we can give relax relax

350
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,710
or street io nella

351
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,580
my mark I don't know I promise

352
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,210
we'll see it somewhere

353
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,380
I hope I put these values

354
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,480
on restrictive mode because if

355
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,820
someone has certain disputes with at least one

356
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,070
subdomain having these two values

357
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,680
restrictive mode fails

358
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,130
this is the important thing

359
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,490
then there  it's the whole part of the bio report

360
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,640
here the correct advice is to leave

361
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,490
these ctf or as the default value for

362
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,620
the we can define

363
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,450
a rather useless thing water to what

364
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,190
percentage of emails the

365
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,840
inch mark is applied so it makes no sense to

366
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,450
apply it 83 100 al  93 at the

367
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,990
family cinema made of tests

368
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,860
ok and

369
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,670
f o defines the rules for when

370
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,150
the mark report must be generated this

371
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,930
is an important thing because

372
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,670
we

373
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,790
decide according to what fails

374
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,220
i.e. put 01 god it according to

375
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,010
what fails

376
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,890
general record ok so for example  if

377
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,560
I put 0 it generates the tax

378
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,369
of the issuer if all checks

379
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,459
fail or if I put 1 if only one

380
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,200
of the two checks  it fails here's where

381
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,720
it's important from is that if we have a

382
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,060
way of doing it by kim laghi vaart

383
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,770
it also works only with the f series

384
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,070
ok sorry i wrote a little too

385
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,970
small anyway

386
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,920
this slide here explains

387
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,140
what the report parameters are

388
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,050
so practically

389
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,290
in which

390
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,430
the also format

391
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,260
these reports are created there are two formats

392
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,020
defined by entities by two rfcs which are

393
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,360
srf format or yoder format

394
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,360
the

395
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,580
del rey parameter defines the

396
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,930
time interval of the reports in seconds it is

397
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,750
practically the rua parameter defines

398
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,270
the list of emails  who receive the

399
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,600
report shouted and parameter roof which

400
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,510
at the last sorry I have to do whole

401
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,150
first largest defines the list the

402
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,920
email with the list of emails they

403
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,230
receive also returns department the

404
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,760
preferences are for a single

405
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,530
email reporting aggregates contain  a

406
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,270
zipped file that contains practically

407
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,270
the aggregate of all those who have

408
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,750
tried to make the domain

409
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,030
ok then this has nothing to do with the

410
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,250
spoofin  g but I wanted to talk about it for a

411
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,230
moment center a moment a little more

412
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,190
with the man in the mirror attack

413
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,170
there are two other records which are mta

414
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,050
sts and dan which can be inserted on the

415
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,380
always on the dns which go to protect

416
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,460
the integrity of our  email mmt sts is

417
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,790
a mechanism that indicates that

418
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,470
communication between not needed for

419
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,200
mail server that sends mail reserves

420
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,840
that it receives must be encrypted and

421
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,520
that there was state must be valid

422
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,910
also defines what must what happens

423
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,120
to the certificate is not valid so if

424
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,310
for example someone pulls

425
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,120
something down along the path or if

426
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,450


427
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,180
there is no tls in the transmission chain and then there is the whole

428
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,290
reporting part here too to

429
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,649
understand if the path is all

430
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:57,590
encrypted or not or if there is a file

431
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,389
somewhere the dan tls not functional

432
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:05,470
other certificates I say a bit ugly

433
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,009
mt sts a bit like the sds transposed in the

434
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,059
email

435
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,279
sorry for this comparison maybe just

436
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,360
to give an idea here is the give tls not

437
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,929
uti  lizza certificates but uses dns 7

438
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,539
so domains must always have dns

439
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:29,960
are two fairly new standards and

440
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,090
are not used much especially by

441
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,830
them found almost nowhere

442
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,320
also because dry dns today I saw

443
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,789
that very few use it

444
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,980
we don't have it  on a mail system however

445
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,950
I say they will arrive they

446
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,659
are needed more in my opinion something that

447
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:48,799
could be useful in short for

448
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,840
the agency born the security reserve to

449
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,120
see a provider who has placed those who are

450
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,340
not in order

451
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,570
that speech certainly to

452
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,600
avoid man attacks in

453
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,639
this is  the purpose and the two things do not

454
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,929
collide, that is, they can implement both

455
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:08,679
a record because the other

456
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,710
ok let's go back for a moment to the topic of

457
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,419
monitoring the report there are

458
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,029
services that allow us to do it by

459
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,879
parsing the report and therefore help us

460
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,860
read them in a very  simpler

461
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,379
matter of graphs or finding the

462
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:26,110
report we are interested

463
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,029
in gear or mark analyzer and

464
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:32,029
obviously there are better generated ones

465
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,429
from them saying the reporting and

466
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,899
then they make us these human reports

467
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,440
otherwise we get lost in the report

468
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
ok then

469
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,549
when we discuss the mail so

470
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:47,600
we have to go see very

471
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,040
important go if so we can

472
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,170
do it with any dns reader tour

473
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,590
or mx toolbox which is done  purposely to

474
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,770
hold the dns record relating to

475
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,390
e-mail then the

476
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,330
ideal conditions are to have the esp f non-existent

477
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,909
or with a question mark plus

478
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,800


479
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,190
softail value in the sense

480
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,140
we know more or question mark it is

481
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,820
better if there is a software that's fine all the

482
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,000
same it could go in the  spam by kim

483
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,670
non existent

484
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,260
by mark non existent

485
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,910
filtering system non existent we

486
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,970
manage to stew really great you will tell me

487
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,770
who is the mail so many people

488
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,870
really many people go

489
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,820
check

490
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,520
his meatsuit bocci many domains you will

491
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,980
see why year they are all fixing

492
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,410
us but

493
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,420
not  I should tell you but

494
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,840
national security point gov.it had no spf

495
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,600
in the di  who in the alpha brands point

496
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,430
gov.it for el said he had neither spf in the kings

497
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,210
therefore car so

498
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,410
these as well as many other people

499
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,170
in 2018

500
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,260
descent had the stf configured badly and

501
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,270
or stewed the limbs descent

502
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,940
undersecretary defense and his flag aide

503
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,080


504
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,810
and then obviously  immediately reported

505
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,350
finding him phone numbers on type

506
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,550
and I wrote him a message on whatsapp

507
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,470
piero buffon proposal however

508
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,150
and here what happened after they

509
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,070
fixed spf they didn't do from mars

510
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,060
they didn't do they didn't do brands and

511
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,610
and therefore they did something  they had know

512
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,410
fox as a filtering system in his

513
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,900
tour point they could have done more he

514
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,850
says

515
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,850
ok

516
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,680
conditions less ideal to have sps less

517
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,870
clearly kim's is irrelevant

518
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,940
they had not to have it for

519
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,580


520
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,790
mail spoofing mark non existent

521
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,080
filtering system non existent then

522
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,880
we have unfavorable conditions

523
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,940
sps minor of mark present with thumb

524
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,710
configured

525
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,070
non-existent filtering system

526
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,480
c  negative conditions at most don't

527
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,510
do spoofing if you have kim and

528
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,850
mark's spf continue policy and maybe even

529
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,440
the mail filtering system

530
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,710
that carries out further checks on the

531
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,320
spa

532
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,870
ok how to pacify

533
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,460
mail header well mozilla thunderbird

534
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,750
with berthoud lights that  allows you to

535
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,880
change

536
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,510
the fields field from many of the mail

537
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,040
the america used obviously in the barrels

538
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,740
must not be traced back to them you work in

539
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,350
any way and or you can make an

540
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,960
attack with set social engineer

541
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,930
toolkit station e mail that you find in

542
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,200


543
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,580
linux I like doing it more  with mozilla ed

544
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,620
on the hit between all little hand because at least

545
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,280
I know what I'm doing and everything is under

546
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,430
control

547
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,280
here we go back to the first flight when

548
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,160
we talked about the signature

549
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,960
ok now the signature becomes important

550
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,470
because having an e-mail with the signature as

551
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,600
real as possible

552
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,350
the deception

553
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,510
succeeds  better

554
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,299
then it becomes very important to do a

555
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,000
good assinter search to know

556
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,610
who they have to go that mail from  who

557
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,980
has to go and how to sign it

558
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,720
generally the signature that says in

559
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,789
companies is placed on the domain and then

560
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:44,220
takes the fields name, surname and

561
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,840
telephone number etc. from the address book that

562
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,960
seriously gives mail so

563
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,850
just change the important elements

564
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,410
of the signature and then the  the rest you can

565
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,789
arrange yourself according to the show

566
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:56,250
internally own

567
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,970
filter system filter

568
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,620
systems can be identified from the mx fitting

569
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,039
because in general we start most of the

570
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:05,630
time

571
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,220
here I put the main

572
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,419
filter systems and

573
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,570
how can I do it

574
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,570
both

575
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,800
precisely from make sure record  sending

576
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,530
an email to the filtering system

577
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,190
uncertain with a link or kay almost all

578
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,050
filtering systems open the link in the

579
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,960
sandbox so basically when I mention the

580
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,700
link we put it to us we can't

581
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,720
make a node.js server ok and then

582
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,240
I call the filtering system  and let's

583
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,820
understand

584
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,200
what the filtering system and I said

585
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,210
first the active mode the

586
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,220
passive mode go read rec  ord mx1 32

587
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,230
ok bypass in the filtering system

588
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,210
this is quite important thing

589
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,340
then the mail server certain

590
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,020
connections only from the

591
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,179
filtering system or even from outside for

592
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:02,590
many people to see the

593
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,840
filtering system however they let the

594
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,190
mail servers accept connections also

595
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,150
from the outside

596
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,170
so this is the thing we need to

597
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,870
check well there are several ways to

598
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,340
do this you can write a

599
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,170
long enough mail channel

600
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,300
or you can simply

601
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,970


602
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,170
go to the mail server operating system host file and resolve

603
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,790
the server address  mail of the

604
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,590
host file and not from our ok in the emails

605
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,550
we write we put the

606
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,770
delivery confirmation if I go back the

607
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,960
delivery confirmation it means that

608
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,730
we have bypassed the

609
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,570
filtering system therefore a very

610
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,870
simple operation to do in a minute 2

611
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,290
minutes

612
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,330
or you can  check the eternals and

613
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,710
we go back to the second slide

614
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,260
ask questions about the trend of the GDP and

615
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,950
need an answer ch  and awaits you if the

616
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:01,779
response of rc ptrc that you are ok as

617
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,029
ok or it can be done in another way

618
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:07,730
it makes a nice podium singh all

619
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,230
filtering systems have quite a few

620
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,570
addresses in white list because usually

621
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,960
the addresses of the stakeholders  more

622
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,000
important are whitelisted

623
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,880
then via or on integers we exit

624
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,630
also makes them do things

625
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,830
ok then

626
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,990
here

627
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,690
via paci finished

628
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,130
what are in my point of view the

629
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,470
optimal configurations of the

630
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,330
mail server with the filter system

631
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,039
filtering for security well then

632
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,679
for  the incoming mail mx records and

633
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,309
point obviously filter

634
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,620
system filter system barmenk gateway

635
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,190
firewall mail server

636
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,299
all mail arrives on the

637
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,770
filter system in the ghetto the mail server

638
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,840
for receiving mail thanks to

639
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,029
we will do the intermediate accept connections

640
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,640
only  from

641
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,990
the filter system hippies in the df

642
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,899
we can do this step

643
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:07,640
on the mail server too because the

644
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,440
services in the post server too  a we can

645
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,649
tell him that he only accepts

646
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:16,340
connections from dp of the

647
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,309
filtering system on these services that in front of you so however

648
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:21,080
I prefer to put him in the middle

649
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,080
because it gives us a minimum of protection

650
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,230
obviously it's not that the half

651
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,120
can do great things to protect

652
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,799
the  webmail for the production of

653
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,020
webmail it's better to have something like

654
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,889
it's scary

655
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,290
something like that

656
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,810
because because if they start to have

657
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,490
webmail let's mention adjust it by mail

658
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,590
or kay outgoing mail here's another

659
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,780
mistake that many make they don't use

660
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,240
the mail filtering system  to

661
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,970
send the e-mails and because this is a

662
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,770
very big mistake because all the

663
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,220
filtering systems have a pool of p

664
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,130
in the smtp server they are the one that gives me

665
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,290
the mail they are rotated and

666
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,000
above all they are monitored that they

667
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,050
never end up in the black list and therefore who

668
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,280
then the other nice thing that

669
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,890
filtering systems have is both and this they

670
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,870
agree if a mailbox is

671
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,300
smearing and they isolate it when

672
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,130
then by doing this thing here we

673
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,170
go to ensure that we never end up

674
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,850
on the black list parma many people

675
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,410
cover the filtering system

676
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,820
they only put the input but it can

677
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,860
appear on the output then maybe they

678
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,600
take malware and end up on the black ii spam

679
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,530
condominium on the left  of opposites

680
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,630
ok dns configuration well we have seen

681
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,540
spf of king of mark with activated policy

682
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,580
and monitoring even if the

683
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,960
activated policy we always arrive high

684
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,790
monitoring because monitoring is important

685
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,100
we don't need only to see

686
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,460
if there are those who are boring us but we

687
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,230
need to understand if  on our system

688
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,220
imposed by law some problems

689
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,530
and then oh well mts of s

690
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,250
if you want to do it it's not bad another piece of

691
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,400
advice I give to

692
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,700
secure the

693
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,380
reserve system of seats the system and globals

694
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,170
placed system in front of filtering

695
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,510
enable it tfa both on

696
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,670
filtering system that to his mailboxes that on

697
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,920
the mail server and for administrators

698
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,770
because it already happened that they have

699
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,660
took away the password of a

700
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,080
mailbox for the same if that is the puree

701
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,900
we solved it

702
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,420
ok

703
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,140
optimal mail server configuration

704
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,190
these are fairly

705
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,950
obvious things words I say because as I said they

706
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,900
are trivial but they don't always happen

707
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,970
therefore

708
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,930
mail server always requires

709
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,820
encrypted connections choose

710
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,220
tls versions

711
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,870


712
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,370
supported user must try to send

713
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,910
mail from local domain

714
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,410
okay if there is a minimum of other

715
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,480
spoofing on mail server enabled

716
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,760


717
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,690
obviously block ip addresses

718
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,680
suspected of passwords that singh and

719
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,550
also block  users who on a

720
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,650
password goal and so we understand

721
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,110
that there is something wrong and then obviously

722
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,190
update support the whole

723
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:19,050
system this is obvious ok how do you do

724
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,480
it just two pona leasing the email

725
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,070
well in my opinion it shouldn't be done

726
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,160
i.e. the  best way to

727
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,900
spoof mail and try to compromise

728
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,790
business processes simply by

729
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,560
asking personal stak  eholders to

730
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,870
take actions then make me

731
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,060
the transfer they go around account make me

732
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,670
the purchase famila sale there is

733
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,320
an appointment for the technician who comes to

734
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,440
you and we give each other a hand with a bit of

735
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,530
vishing and with a bit of fiji so my

736
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,750
name is  with fashionable levers we refer to a

737
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,730
call with forged paintings here we give

738
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,950
a little force to this e-mail

739
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,120
which is more or less

740
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,310
legitimate because in this way we attack the

741
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,860
human factor and not all the security systems

742
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,549


743
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,369
that could if we go to work with

744
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:09,519
partners  the engineer toolkit maybe tell us

745
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,860
the malware that we have put

746
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,950
in the attachment or maybe understand that the

747
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,159
inca ternano bad flights

748
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,139
ok

749
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:22,570
another thing that works very well

750
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,820
is to insert an illicit link

751
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,869
inside the emails and put the

752
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,669
company domain after the  flash therefore

753
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:34,299
a folder of the server

754
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:36,940
completely reproduce the website the user

755
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,460
who reads the email sees the

756
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,739
domain name that he must consult in the

757
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:47,259
wrong place but does not understand it he goes there  and at

758
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,970
that point we can tell him data damage

759
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,020


760
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,840
you cannot access the page enter

761
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
the password rather than upload

762
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,220
files etc.

763
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,600
ok and look at a small bonus track for

764
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,610
me I said vaguely but in

765
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,740
reality it's not a bong it's that it works

766
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,690
so we can't  say an

767
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,440
exchange bug but exchanges functional yes i

768
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,960
checked it again on monday so i

769
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,668
guess it's still been years that certain

770
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,500
thing so i don't think they have it cake

771
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,909
of the week

772
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,320
so basically when

773
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:26,690
you post on exchange you can put

774
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,880
small case

775
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,960
so what do we do  for example my

776
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,460
domain that albert hall of cyber

777
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,850
security dot.com ok I buy

778
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,639
bertoldi cybersecurity domain so with a

779
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,699
lowercase i and then when I write the email

780
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,800
instead of putting it I put the i in

781
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,820
capital letters to all intents and purposes everything is

782
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,159
legal

783
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,469
so those emails will not come  blocked

784
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:54,130
never will allow me to

785
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,130
write

786
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,950
frames of the domain

787
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,930
this problem has been reported

788
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,920
leonardo company that has bought  for

789
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,120
two minimum days you could have understood it

790
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,130
sanpaolo had it enel who doesn't know the

791
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,320
minions was free anyway finding

792
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,450
domain with the l is quite simple

793
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,740
so be

794
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,090
careful because something

795
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,400
serious enough is quite dangerous how to

796
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,440
exploit it well buy domain like

797
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,510
the post office of the l buy  at this

798
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,190
point one more exchange box and

799
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,960
configure them with the least original ones

800
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,020
therefore with hiv instead of l

801
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,450
do everything we can do to

802
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,040
give maximum deliverability

803
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,530
so we say spf of kinki brands then

804
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,760
we make ourselves a woman from the apple

805
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,610
manifest lieutenant  understood 10 10 and then

806
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,530
let's hope

807
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,410
ok possible you understand cations well black

808
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,420
list on the filtering system for the

809
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,040
crib on my filtering system

810
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,890
put that bertoldi with the aic cannot

811
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,710
send in aver

812
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,110
or

813
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,510
on gmail this thing doesn't work so

814
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:12,350
if the recipient uses google

815
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,530
space can be found here nobody does by

816
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,000
transposing the address on a sheet of

817
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,590
world by converting i  n all lowercase

818
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,510
therefore therefore realizing however who is

819
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,140
doing it now

820
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,620
question
