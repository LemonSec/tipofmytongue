1
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,170
boy interlude a Corolla okay so a lot of

2
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,070
English exist the persona English we

3
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,830
need so I mean I've been a cybersecurity

4
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,180
journalist for some years recently I'm

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,040
working as a cybersecurity awareness

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,829
manager in a company but I've been

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:41,320
covering darknets and cyber crime and

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,149
hacktivism and some state-sponsored

9
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,590
attacks so today I want to talk about

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,620
operational security from an attacker

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,030
standpoint and of course we are going to

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,000
talk about also the human factor because

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,140
in the operational security you can get

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,250
the technology right but you can still

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,630
fail your OPSEC and of course there is a

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,930
difference between the technology and

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,340
the tradecraft so you can have a very

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,229
secure strong technology but you maybe

19
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,170
you are not really able to use it in a

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,350
proper way or even if you have the right

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,799
tradecraft you can still commit some

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,090
mistakes make some mistakes that

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,880
depending most of the times from human

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,100
vulnerabilities some of them not all of

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,670
them are listed here so for instance

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,479
your past and undisciplined past because

27
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,219
even the most skilled attacker with the

28
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,990
best OPSEC at the time where it wasn't

29
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,399
that way and so either you have no

30
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,250
connection with your past or your past

31
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,050
is going to break your OPSEC then no

32
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,170
conferment ation of identities and also

33
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,540
of different operation we know that it's

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,810
important comparemaine tations important

35
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,610
for devices for

36
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,000
the average user or for the analyst but

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,950
for from a an attacker point of view

38
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,030
it's important for especially for

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,960
identities because when you add

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,960
contamination of identities we will see

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,720
many cases where contamination of

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,020
identities will have compromised some of

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,080
these hackers or cyber criminals

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,550
depending on what they are doing also

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,730
another thing is undeletable data we all

46
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,280
know the data sometimes is difficult to

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,480
delete but it's especially difficult on

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,510
the internet when it may be out of your

49
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,000
control it's not like you know wiping

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
something on your device so like sent

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,540
messages to its post on forums there are

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,100
many things that maybe you think you

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,670
have deleted and actually they they

54
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,519
haven't well maybe someone else archived

55
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,410
them and also language language is the

56
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,290
most underestimated human vulnerability

57
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,330
in OPSEC and so that's why I say that

58
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,280
language is a traitor because we live

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,180
many traces in language and I can tell

60
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,769
you because I actually I've been

61
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,510
studying humanities and but of course

62
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,440
you can't use it maybe as evidence but

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,200
it can be enough to get a warrant or to

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,769
support a warrant and of course also

65
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,810
money flaws because we all know the old

66
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,668
investigative technique of following the

67
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:19,100
money but especially when you move a lot

68
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,290
of money you can make a lot of mistakes

69
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,360
or there are there may be

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,310
vulnerabilities in the cryptocurrency

71
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,430
you use in the payment processor you use

72
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,550
and also especially during the cash out

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,630
process then the rush to get results if

74
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,150
you are under pressure maybe because you

75
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,169
are in a group

76
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,870
maybe it's a state-sponsored group you

77
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,349
need to get results quickly or you know

78
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:51,860
your cover has been blown out and so the

79
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,080
the rush to get results is going to

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,469
break your OPSEC or it's going not to

81
00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:01,729
make you plan plan it properly and then

82
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,979
group dynamics the biggest the group and

83
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:10,819
the wars from unless it's really a year

84
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,560
are kacal Millett military group so

85
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,279
group dynamics are bad for OPSEC or

86
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,419
maybe they can be exploited for finding

87
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,310
vulnerabilities in OPSEC depending on

88
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,479
your standpoint of course and also peer

89
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,499
pressure and the need of recognition

90
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,999
especially in groups like cyber criminal

91
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,270
groups but also hacktivism is the major

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,939
factor because maybe you need to change

93
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,400
our identity but then you also need to

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,370
be reaccept 'add and recognized in a

95
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,789
certain community and so this is a sort

96
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,479
of conflict of interests so let's see

97
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,319
some some cases this one is about our

98
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,529
old Martin Eric Martin was a contractor

99
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,740
for the NCAA and has been recently

100
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,680
sentenced to nine years for stealing

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,860
secret documents he actually had a ton

102
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,770
of documents in his house and even in in

103
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,129
his car and it was doing a PhD in

104
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,580
information security management and

105
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,009
according to the indictment he used

106
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,050
virtual machines encryption

107
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,870
anonymization systems probably I think

108
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,569
tails or a similar one because they say

109
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,509
a softer tool that runs without being

110
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,669
installed provides anonymous internet

111
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,149
access and so and so also he had an

112
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,849
ability to conceal his online

113
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,979
communications and access to the

114
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:43,839
Internet

115
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,060
however his object was really really bad

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,009
you know you remember the shadow brokers

117
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,979
you know it was 2016 and there was this

118
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,440
mysterious

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,740
dumping NSA tools and exploits on

120
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,780
internet actually then from from balls

121
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,050
exploits from some of those I expose we

122
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,539
also I'd wanna cry and not piteå

123
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:14,710
afterwards anyway half an hour before

124
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,490
the show the brokers basically came out

125
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,520
Martin sent strange messages to

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,840
Kaspersky researchers through direct

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,380
messages on Twitter and using a Twitter

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,400
handle this nine nine nine nine

129
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,360
the fact is that this Twitter handle was

130
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,750
connected to his real life as we shall

131
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,539
tip and of course the researchers that

132
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,639
we see you received these messages was

133
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,210
were really suspicious and they thought

134
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,820
that he may be connected to the shadow

135
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,180
bloggers the shadow brokers group or the

136
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,550
things that was going on so they

137
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,810
actually tipped off the NSA or someone

138
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,130
in the government in the US and then the

139
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,630
FBI raided Martin's house and found a

140
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,270
lot really a lot of National Defense

141
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,340
documents so how did they found him

142
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,800
basically through some Google searches

143
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,729
because apparently he used the same

144
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,059
Twitter handle or display name it's a

145
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,779
little bit different for in a personal

146
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,459
ad on a dating website so there was with

147
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,300
ad seeking some sex partners and with

148
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,209
the same handle with the same username

149
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,620
and also this odd the real picture of

150
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,209
Martin and his real age and location but

151
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,839
digging and doing some searches the

152
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,330
researchers also found

153
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,500
a LinkedIn profile for Martine where he

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,650
of course was saying that he was working

155
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,510
in the cyber offensive field and also

156
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,060
you notice that it was using this

157
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,980
acronym cambric it stands for compute

158
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,940
cloud artificial intelligence

159
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,490
cybersecurity but it's not I don't think

160
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,130
it's so common and he actually used the

161
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,589
same one or so in the link hidden

162
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,110
profile it was really keen on this I

163
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,470
don't know why anyway so we have the

164
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,930
Twitter handle that goes to the date

165
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,050
inside and his real photo location and

166
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,839
age and then somehow to the LinkedIn

167
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,240
profile where also you have some

168
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,370
language clues linking the two profiles

169
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,460
and also the Twitter account was created

170
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,529
with an email associated with real life

171
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:10,750
and on a social network you also add on

172
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,570
a social network with again this same

173
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,170
username yet again his picture actually

174
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,100
the picture of the driving license so

175
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,660
really no official one so yeah

176
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,839
clearly there are quite big big objects

177
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,410
and also to finish the story he's been

178
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,490
sentenced it for stealing and willfully

179
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,490
retaining with documents but not for

180
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,570
espionage so apparently it didn't pass

181
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,380
with documents to others or in it has

182
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,450
not been proved so another case another

183
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,370
recent case was the breach of Capital

184
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,750
One Capital One is with bank and

185
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,089
financial banking and financial company

186
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:13,080
that was breached in in reality in March

187
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,970
even if it came out later later

188
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,400
so it was breached and

189
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,220
the data of million of customer will

190
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,620
response like you know data such as

191
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,740
credit scores credit applications and so

192
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,280
some of this leaked data were stormed

193
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,330
openly on github and Capital One has

194
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,090
been tipped by someone who saw this data

195
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,210
and wrote an email to their email

196
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,760
address like you know like it was in the

197
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,520
email address for disclosing

198
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,290
vulnerability so we see sources

199
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,300
suggestion that companies that it's good

200
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,510
to have a point of contact to receive

201
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,660
tips of about security at least the very

202
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,100
least an email and anyway this github

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,480
page I know it sounds a little bit crazy

204
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
but included the full name of page

205
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,790
Thompson which is the main suspect and

206
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,480
has been arrested for this case and it

207
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,800
was linked to other pages on github link

208
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,480
to Thompson and resume also she posted

209
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,530
about the arc on his luck channel also

210
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,220
naming a VP and provider which matched

211
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,710
the Capital One lakhs of the intruder

212
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,280
and also the Geeta blogs and also there

213
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,620
are many other key things like a meetup

214
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,990
group that was linked to the slack

215
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,760
channel and that their name is organizer

216
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,640
and also the same alias erratic that was

217
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,340
present all over and was also Twitter

218
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,190
with a real picture where she was

219
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,610
talking about the ARCA somehow probably

220
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,500
if you look at the feed the Twitter feed

221
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,690
she was probably having some hard times

222
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:21,850
anyway and this is the number case

223
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,800
dramatic one actually it's about

224
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,430
Alexander cases goddess and you know the

225
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,840
pronunciation but it was this young

226
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,960
programmer from Canada moved to Thailand

227
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,180
and it was the alleged kingpin behind

228
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,010
halfa Bay market you know alpha by

229
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,830
market alpha market it's been for a

230
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,610
while one of the most important market

231
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,470
place in the dark net selling drugs but

232
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,930
also it was actually quite important to

233
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:03,820
hub for the English cybercrime community

234
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,820
he has been arrested in Bangkok and he

235
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,130
actually committed suicide after a few

236
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,650
days in prison some years before the

237
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,650
administrator of alpha bay so maybe

238
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,600
allegedly causes at the declare that it

239
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,840
was secure I mean he was certain than

240
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,040
his hopsack was secure and it was living

241
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,930
in offshore country so what went wrong

242
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,890
from an opposite perspective again an

243
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,710
email address you know email is really

244
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,890
like a very common element in this

245
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,520
presentation anyway an email address in

246
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,510
the Alpha Bay forum welcome message so

247
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,120
we are these email address that link to

248
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,910
his real name and then to link it in and

249
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,810
to pay Paul and now we see how exactly

250
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,100
what's happening is that in in December

251
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,890
2013

252
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,680
alpha Bay added the forum you have to

253
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,690
know that with marketplaces

254
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,830
they are like eBay market markets where

255
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,910
there are vendors selling stuff mostly

256
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,300
legal stuff and but they usually have

257
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,650
also a forum as well where users you

258
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,370
know create sort of community so there

259
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,150
was service forum and the users who

260
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,360
registered on it got a greeting message

261
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,030
from the site and in this greeting

262
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,500
message in the header

263
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,790
there was with male pimp Alex 91 hotmail

264
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,780
hotmail two years later actually this

265
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,780
mail has been present for a short time

266
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:04,130
in in 2014 and then has been removed but

267
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,930
two years later the FBI received the tip

268
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,950
probably or anyway learn somehow that

269
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,490
drew was with greeting email and started

270
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,620
to investigate on the email address on

271
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,090
the connected email address

272
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,590
yeah the email was also present in the

273
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,790
it was also in the recovery process

274
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,590
of the password so there were at least

275
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,570
two two places anyway the FBI linked it

276
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,360
to is identity and to his LinkedIn

277
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,220
account of course it was born in 1991

278
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,930
you see 91 yet the same year also in the

279
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,700
email address and also drew was a PayPal

280
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,980
account that was connected with hotmail

281
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,500
account and also other things like used

282
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,349
visas pseudonym alpha O'Toole as

283
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,099
administrator of alpha bay but with

284
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:22,230
alias has been used in the past even in

285
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,579
an older post on a tech forum where it

286
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:33,000
was linked with name so another

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,150
important interesting aspect of this

288
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,660
case was the way it was arrested because

289
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,340
as you know and in the last years there

290
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,830
have been a lot of cases where

291
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,690
investigators and police really try to

292
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,320
get the laptop of this

293
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,570
suspects when when the laptop is not

294
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,780
closed and encrypted so then they really

295
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,130
need to overcome the encryption in a

296
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,500
creative way so basically in this case

297
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,340
the police calls the alpha based servers

298
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,710
to shut down forcing others to try to

299
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,090
access them and to reboot the SAS talk

300
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,930
of law enforcement caused outage outage

301
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,320
so I don't know exactly but it's I think

302
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,050
it's very interesting and then so they

303
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,140
treat him to crash the car through his

304
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,440
gate and so he went out to see what was

305
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,340
going on and in this movie recovered all

306
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,680
the passwords for the servers that were

307
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,040
stored in an encrypted text Manero ATO

308
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:04,270
and Bitcoin around the world of course

309
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,100
when we talk about email and also

310
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,490
contamination of identity we have to

311
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,650
talk about also Ross Ulbricht Ross

312
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,290
Ulbricht as you probably know is been

313
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,340
the creator of Silk Road which was the

314
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,900
first market place of this kind and the

315
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,030
investigation on Albrecht is actually

316
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,480
very complex but so I just focus on this

317
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,230
but I mean is not been identified just

318
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,720
because of this but this is just

319
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,150
interesting because he basically used

320
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:48,850
this handle Altoid to publicize Silk

321
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,990
Road at the very very beginning when no

322
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,840
one really knew about the site but of

323
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,990
course he had you know it needed to

324
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,400
promote it somehow so he pretended to be

325
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,270
just a user talking about we cite in the

326
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,770
promote

327
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:15,180
it and actually with with posters been

328
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,530
saved in a quote from someone else and

329
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,850
later on on the same forum he was

330
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,660
looking for some developer for some

331
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,820
Bitcoin related project something very

332
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,130
vague but he used the same nickname the

333
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,830
same Altoid handle and II wrote is email

334
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,910
is in his email and his real name sod

335
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:54,330
resort Roth's will break at gmail.com so

336
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,460
you see there is really of course if you

337
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,340
are investigating this case you start to

338
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,210
look for their very first appearances of

339
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,220
mentions of Silk Road who is talking

340
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,470
about it and then you start you know to

341
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,530
look for it but also again we were

342
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,590
talking about the creative strategies to

343
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,160
get unencrypted laptops and Ross

344
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,620
Ulbricht is an example because he has

345
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,020
been arrested when he was working in a

346
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,430
public library and they wait for him to

347
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:35,120
be connected to logged in sick road and

348
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,220
to two FBI agents a woman and man

349
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,650
simulated a fight just behind him a very

350
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,200
violent fight so that he got distracted

351
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,560
and they snatched the laptop in a very

352
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,640
in a second so and they got really a lot

353
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,760
of things a lot of evidence from his

354
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,360
laptop

355
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,860
he even wrote a diary a journal about is

356
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,560
about Silk Road project basically as the

357
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,060
aspart the group wrote we have a lot of

358
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,550
things here we have a lot of objects ale

359
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,880
your's poor complementation also profile

360
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,630
in

361
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,870
the profiling because if you would go to

362
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,370
is a LinkedIn profile you would see that

363
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,980
he had the same ideology that Dread

364
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,670
Pirate Roberts the persona administering

365
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,300
Silk Road was promoting sod resorts to

366
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,100
this kind of contamination another case

367
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,680
from the under under war the market is

368
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,580
the case of oxy monster he was a vendor

369
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,900
on marketplace dream market he was

370
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,200
arrested in the US after he flew to the

371
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,800
US to attend the birthday competition

372
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,320
which sounds again a little crazy

373
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,620
because he was selling drugs to US

374
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,650
customers it was living in France but it

375
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,210
was selling around the world and he was

376
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,050
selling drugs also in the US and but he

377
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,560
felt safe enough to go there to attend a

378
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,740
bird competition and he actually brought

379
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,560
his own work laptop with him so border

380
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,380
guards searched his laptop

381
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,880
I don't again I'm not sure how they they

382
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,970
accessed the laptop if he was again like

383
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,760
we said the former case getting his

384
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,450
laptop when he was using it or if you

385
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,340
didn't have a password I have no idea

386
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,720
but anyway they found a lot of stuff

387
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,410
credentials for the market private keys

388
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,010
bitcoins and and so on but the question

389
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,100
here is why was he a suspect in in first

390
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:15,930
place so because some tips because it

391
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:21,240
was also I told of forums before so he

392
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,210
was actually doing some community

393
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,370
activity community support in the forum

394
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,210
helping people and he was receiving

395
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,090
donations from people

396
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:43,110
through a Bitcoin address and from this

397
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,690
address there were some transaction

398
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,070
going to a local Bitcoin account local

399
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,910
that was registered to this gala

400
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,600
malarious so the police started to

401
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,070
investigate about this Cal malarious

402
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,430
trying to understand was and found is

403
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,640
social social accounts his profiles and

404
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,850
they analyzed is writing style because

405
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,270
basically compared is writing style to

406
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,260
the writing style of oxy monsters Andriy

407
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,880
market because they had a lot of

408
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,210
comments left by oxy monster on on the

409
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,360
forums so they did bisa writing an hour

410
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,510
comparison there were you know he was

411
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,330
using a lot of exclamations quotation

412
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,800
marks French words other kind of

413
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,100
specific words okay of course you are

414
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,600
not going to maybe to to sentence

415
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,580
someone just for this but it may be

416
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,770
enough to get a warrant and to search

417
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,800
his laptop at the border as it happened

418
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,020
so basically in this case we have chain

419
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,430
analysis social media wasn't writing

420
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,580
analysis and device search at the border

421
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,610
and the mistakes were that he didn't use

422
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,950
the no temple I mean no Templars no way

423
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,480
of you know like obfuscating the trails

424
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,540
of Bitcoin transactions no

425
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,450
complementation of identities no

426
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,020
avoiding us him in this case we could

427
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,320
end no encryption on the laptop or any

428
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,870
way not being careful about the

429
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:38,700
encryption also activism there are many

430
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,500
cases in the activism field that we

431
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,160
could talk about

432
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:53,580
there is one let's say famous case is

433
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,770
the one about Jeremy Hammond Jeremy

434
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,289
Hammond this bin well it's been an

435
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:08,610
anonymous anti sec hacker and he has

436
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,460
been identified thanks also to some

437
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,990
chaps to some chat logs also saved by

438
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:21,809
another former activist Sabu who was

439
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,929
arrested before and then started to work

440
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:29,130
as you know like for the FBI basically

441
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,409
so suppose if Sabu says that friends

442
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:36,600
will try to take you down if they have

443
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
to you are going to believe him

444
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,570
so Jeremy Hammond was identified also

445
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,130
through a triangulation of the real-life

446
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,610
insights that he revealed through his

447
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,980
nicknames because he used more than one

448
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,020
nickname so like under cows he revealed

449
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,179
some of real-life snippets of him for

450
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,720
instance is also in his real life he had

451
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,860
been arrested also in his for his

452
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,260
activism he was known it was you know

453
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:24,510
kind of already in monitored somehow so

454
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,600
it is mean not difficult to to put the

455
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,500
puzzle together and then after they

456
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,020
started suspecting him they've been

457
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,610
doing really physical monitoring on

458
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,940
Bhima and also they used these devices

459
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,539
pen and track devices that basically try

460
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,960
to to see if he's connected one is

461
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,179
connected when it's a line if he's using

462
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,370
a prison tour and so strong with all

463
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,699
this

464
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:04,130
probable cause elements they went and

465
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,700
arrest him

466
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,030
and so as I said before groups are often

467
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:17,580
an enemy of OPSEC or an ally for people

468
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,350
who are analysts researching on these

469
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,790
groups we are social dynamics groupthink

470
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,130
the need of peer recognition the

471
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,760
exchange of tools all factors that we

472
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,440
can op SEC also hacktivists are easy to

473
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,700
infiltrate and more easier than cyber

474
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,650
criminal groups and of course easier

475
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,860
than stained sponsored groups and we are

476
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,630
here they come the state-sponsored

477
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:57,930
groups at last so good good Seifer 2.0

478
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,350
and the GRU and the GRU which sounds a

479
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,900
little bit like I don't know a music

480
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,780
band yet the good fair and so they are

481
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,600
state-sponsored occurs they are

482
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,060
supposedly Russian GRU military service

483
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,030
intelligence self services responsible

484
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,160
for the Democratic National Committee

485
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,910
hack right you remember it was 2016 and

486
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,920
just before the u.s. presidential

487
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,680
election and there have been all these

488
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,400
acts and leaks of democratic emails and

489
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,990
documents so when this happened and

490
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,660
there have been some talks immediately

491
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,330
about some Russian attribution this

492
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,330
hacker came out out of the blue it was

493
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,350
like a loan Romanian hacker called

494
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,070
Lucifer 2.0 claiming and so on

495
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:05,910
but then this claim started to managed

496
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,850
to interview him on Twitter and at a

497
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,250
certain point is switch to Romanian so

498
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,470
it was from

499
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,690
Google Translate so it was not native

500
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,870
and also there were some identifying

501
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,090
metadata IP address from Moscow these

502
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,390
are all according to the indictment to

503
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,900
the American Indian at a certain point

504
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,080
but also all the group all the

505
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,760
activities were kind of eight so the

506
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,110
same malware same infrastructure and

507
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,520
also the money flows again mainly

508
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,230
Bitcoin mining Bitcoin that had been

509
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,960
used to purchase the same pool of

510
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,020
Bitcoin there are some different things

511
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,059
that have been purchased it and also

512
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:05,210
from the same Bitcoin address we have a

513
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,970
connection between Lucifer and another

514
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,740
site which was the DC leaks site which

515
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,980
claim to be made by American activists

516
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,909
so apparently Lucifer blog and the DC

517
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:22,700
leak site were supposed to be separate

518
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,750
entities and in fact the funding sure

519
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,980
that were very much connected also some

520
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,640
researchers found from the bitly link

521
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,080
the bitly URL that was the were put in

522
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,320
the spear phishing emails sent to target

523
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,159
they were able to to see all the

524
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:51,260
campaign all the attacker campaign

525
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,630
because the BT account they used was not

526
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,840
set to private was not was public

527
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,789
basically so they could see all the bit

528
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:02,090
ly links they used in the phishing

529
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,409
campaign and this has been like a window

530
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:11,210
into the attacker activities in another

531
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,159
case another state-sponsored the case is

532
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,650
the one about Lazarus group Lazarus

533
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,190
grouper is to possibly a North Korean

534
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,460
state hacking group

535
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,630
and responsible for things like Sony

536
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:35,779
hack the Bangladesh Bangkok and also

537
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:42,890
when I cry and so the u.s. charged the

538
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,710
specific person a specific North Korean

539
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:54,350
park jinyoung and for being behind with

540
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,909
campaign how did they do basically Park

541
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:01,610
Jin New York is working was working for

542
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,510
a company chosen Expo company but for

543
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,859
the US investigators this just this is

544
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,379
just the front company for North Korean

545
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,980
intelligence and they found connection

546
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,489
between the email used by Park Jinyoung

547
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,918
in his official activities connection

548
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:27,849
with the email used by the attackers

549
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:33,290
so again contaminate contamination

550
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,139
between the real or anyway the real

551
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:45,560
identity and attacker identity and if we

552
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,070
are going to look forward we've been

553
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,339
focusing a lot on the issue of the

554
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:56,989
identity of the attacker so the who but

555
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:01,550
it's also how you are going to what we

556
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,130
are going to know about the attack

557
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,619
how he's made the outcomes of the attack

558
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,410
is going to be important so the water

559
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:16,099
and actually as successful cyber

560
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,099
criminals are the ones who are able to

561
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,210
avoid both detection of their crimes and

562
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,089
their identification this is a quote

563
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:27,980
from this interesting paper Debian

564
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,170
security which is focusing on the way on

565
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,630
the security from the perspective of

566
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,859
cyber criminals and the way

567
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,950
is different from you know the security

568
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,309
that is implemented by all the others

569
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:51,269
and so some final takeaways always from

570
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:54,930
an object Amman neutral OPSEC

571
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,259
perspective so if you have a good crypto

572
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:03,390
and with that I mean cryptography but

573
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,900
you fail at upset and tradecraft then

574
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,859
you're going you know to lose however

575
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,769
crypto helps so encryption is still very

576
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:16,499
relevant for easily and we have seen it

577
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:18,569
because investigators are really trying

578
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:22,109
are desperate to get the devices and

579
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:25,230
encrypted so it's quite an important

580
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,829
issue

581
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:28,349
so of course don't reveal operational

582
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:32,339
data don't link different up campaigns

583
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,940
together don't contaminate so don't

584
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,249
contaminate identities and that's we

585
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:39,170
have seen it

586
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,779
don't keep logs but no logs no crime

587
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:46,499
said the group but the fact is that

588
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:49,559
people love login in norsu cyber

589
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,900
criminal love login for many reasons

590
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,440
also just also for convenience and also

591
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,839
your officer can be good but when you

592
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:01,499
start

593
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:03,210
that's when probably you are going to

594
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,670
mess up if you are going to build a big

595
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,299
attacking campaign with many targets as

596
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:15,569
we have seen well your opposite is going

597
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,089
to be very hard and expensive and

598
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:21,930
probably is the attribution sooner or

599
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,220
later will come to you and the solitaire

600
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,930
highly skilled 1/2 hacker is probably

601
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,039
the toughest one to identify to to

602
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,190
identify and especially if it doesn't

603
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:44,640
move much money so at the end I feel

604
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,460
that just watching these cases I think

605
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,130
that we can conclude that operational

606
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,420
security is

607
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,240
really rooting psychology is really

608
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,329
rooted in mental well-being also not

609
00:37:57,329 --> 00:37:59,130
just in trade graph not adjusting

610
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,650
knowledge skills but is really loot in

611
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,270
the ability to be autonomous to be

612
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,470
patient to be calm and this is the Fink

613
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,530
a good takeaway for all the average

614
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,500
users for all the other people not for

615
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,690
the cyber criminals or the attackers but

616
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,589
it really is a good takeaway lesson for

617
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:26,329
everyone else that OPSEC is really

618
00:38:26,329 --> 00:39:15,950

642
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:51,090
question ok I would like to ask you a

643
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,900
question I'm here ok ok as you mentioned

644
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,990
the cybercrime would you think that the

645
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,060
one of the problems you know OPSEC is

646
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,370
like a pride of them when they want to

647
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,220
show their achievements what do you

648
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,110
think that is a problem also the pride

649
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,970
that they happened yourselves

650
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,330
of course they they asked this is like

651
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,040
the social apps but we were talking

652
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,360
about because we have seen a lot a lot

653
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,990
of bragging about it especially I mean

654
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,390
even if you are alone even if you are by

655
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,310
yourself it's very difficult to

656
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,090
accomplish some you know something very

657
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,780
maybe ever that maybe as a lot of also

658
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,160
impact on media and not really say

659
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,860
anything you know it's really so this

660
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,960
psychology aspect is really common yeah

661
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,980
the need of recognition sometimes it's

662
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,000
just really bragging about it yeah I

663
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,260
think ok

664
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,440
okay thank you
