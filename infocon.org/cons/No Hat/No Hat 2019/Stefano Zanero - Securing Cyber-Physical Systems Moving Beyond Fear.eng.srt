1
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,850
demonstration to an artist is a is

2
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,780
poetry or a painting it's something that

3
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,150
enlightens you in a moment and tells you

4
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,410
something new that you didn't know

5
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,980
before that's what we live for

6
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,010
that's what we look for we don't look

7
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,720
for the OOP sorry that's what we look

8
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,460
for we don't look for lame we look for

9
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,740
Huck however there's something different

10
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,160
than the time that Nero and I spent on

11
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,730
the IFC together chatting he wasn't much

12
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,100
on the IFC was already more adult than

13
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,590
us because he's sold as somebody pointed

14
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,210
out this morning but we are not there

15
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,820
anymore

16
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,280
we are actually on the top of the front

17
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,470
page news so our findings impact the

18
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,590
public perception let me give you an

19
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,430
example now let me be clear before I

20
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,650
start talking about this research that I

21
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,100
am not commenting the research I am

22
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,290
commenting the impact of the research I

23
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,230
put post fully shows research that is

24
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,710
actually good but had an interesting and

25
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,020
misleading impact so now the first piece

26
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,390
of research is this presentation by

27
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,760
andrey cost in boston air traffic and

28
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,450
ray and his co-authors picked up a DSP

29
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,360
which is a protocol used in aviation and

30
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
i will gently thread here because one of

31
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,220
the biggest experts on aviation security

32
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,020
in the world is sitting here in front of

33
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,060
me and rebel is on so if trying to not

34
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,150
to say anything wrong he discussed ideas

35
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,300
be security and he found out that there

36
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,630
were some vulnerabilities which actually

37
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,250
were not really vulnerabilities they

38
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,000
were design choices a DSB is open by

39
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,750
design there are some advantages to its

40
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,620
design that outweigh its security

41
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,490
concerns

42
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,289
and also it is designed and used the

43
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,210
thinking of this so it's not used for

44
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,880
instance in some critical loops where

45
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,910
those designer shall we say issues could

46
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,550
potentially lead to damaging results so

47
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,789
the research was ok maybe the context

48
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,090
was missing and the result on the media

49
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,210
was this next generation air traffic

50
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,419
control vulnerable to hackers spoofing

51
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,130
planes out of thin air

52
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,099
now hackers cannot spoof planes that's

53
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,820
pretty much a given area I will I will

54
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,889
very much trust that we cannot spoof

55
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,580
planes and the point is that without

56
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,370
context this research sounds more

57
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,720
dangerous than it actually is this is

58
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,150
another piece of research that is

59
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,889
similarly doomed organism made this

60
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,659
presentation about aircraft hacking

61
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:56,690
where the core of the presentation was

62
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,460
that you go above the bottom FMS a

63
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,539
flight management system which is a

64
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,930
piece a critical piece of the avionics

65
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,080
on board an aircraft which also controls

66
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,699
the autopilot and it showed that there

67
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,229
was a way to exploit it

68
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,780
which is not terribly surprising most

69
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,690
embedded secure embedded devices do not

70
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,680
have strong security protections now it

71
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,250
showed that and then it showed River

72
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,490
simulator how that could theoretically

73
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,820
do damage to the aircraft and he also

74
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,700
showed at the beginning how to use the

75
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
ABS B to figure out which plane you

76
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,500
wanted to target and what were the

77
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,529
parameters of that plane now on the

78
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,910
media this turned into hacker uses an

79
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,310
Android to remotely attack in the hijack

80
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,810
an airplane where the Android if you are

81
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,820
curious was the fact that he used an app

82
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,150
on his phone to

83
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,240
low 80s B traffic like fright rather r24

84
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,400
for those that use it so this actually

85
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,830
caused the FAA to have to issue

86
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,440
statements saying no look this this is

87
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
not this is not real this is not going

88
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,350
to happen and actually this entire a

89
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,100
factor which also ended up our república

90
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,530
but that's not so surprising probably

91
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,470
this entire factor if you go and look at

92
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,140
the discussions online related to the

93
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,390
disappearance of Malaysia Airlines three

94
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,740
seven zero there's a lot of people that

95
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,870
claim that it was actually I jacked and

96
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,050
pointed this research as a proof that

97
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,630
that can happen that can be hijacked by

98
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,290
remember that so I don't precisely know

99
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,590
what happened to mh370 and we probably

100
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,240
will never really know who absolutely

101
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,420
sure but we do know it's not this but

102
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,150
the list goes on and on so this is side

103
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,180
regan chris roberts a researcher in the

104
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,570
u.s. that tweeted that from a flight

105
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,260
find myself on a 737-800 let's see box

106
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,890
IFE in-flight entertainment SATCOM shall

107
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,050
we start playing with messages paths

108
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,370
oxygen on anyone and it was actually

109
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,140
picked up by the FBI after the flight

110
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,040
landed now what i can reasonably see why

111
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,800
the FBI would be worried and i would be

112
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,240
worried as well the fact is that this

113
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,510
guy never did anything because he

114
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,370
couldn't

115
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,100
there's no way could and every single

116
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,360
researcher with some knowledge of

117
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,860
avionics will tell you that so in spite

118
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,680
of everything else all of these appears

119
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,330
to end up to the conclusion that there's

120
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,310
no way roberts could have a key trans

121
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,330
controls of a plane

122
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,980
these disappeared in wire like weeks

123
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,360
after the fact the guy was interviewed

124
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,640
by khadisha or I you know last year

125
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,510
effect and spun the same tale which has

126
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,230
been the bank the like four years ago so

127
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,500
the point is that sometimes these things

128
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,150
end up in the media because of chains

129
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,910
sometimes some researchers are shall we

130
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,280
say slightly less cautious than they

131
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,570
should be in communicating and sometimes

132
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,270
it's it's really apparent from the start

133
00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:00,140
that something is flawed so this summer

134
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,480
Rubin Santa Marta colleague from I you

135
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,710
active basically show the security

136
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,590
vulnerabilities a piece of code that he

137
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,370
says comes from Boeing 787 onboard

138
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,710
software he basically found that online

139
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:24,360
with disputable ways and then hacked

140
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,840
into it but the important part of the

141
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,890
entire article on this is the part in

142
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,830
bald down there Santa Marta himself

143
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,020
admits that he doesn't have a fully

144
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,540
enough picture of the aircraft or access

145
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,860
to a two hundred and fifty million

146
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,080
dollar jet to confirm its claims in

147
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,530
short it's it's a short

148
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,500
translated translation of that it's not

149
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,270
it's a valid exploit in a software but

150
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,670
you cannot say what that will do to a

151
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,400
plane if you don't have the plane or a

152
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,040
good enough picture of the plane in

153
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,920
order to tell well if you don't you

154
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,940
don't there's a reason why there's not

155
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,380
so many people here doing research on

156
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,090
aviation security it's because you need

157
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,260
the freaking plane in my group we do

158
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,820
research on robots because we have

159
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,070
robots we do research on cars because we

160
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,500
have bought a car and we hack into it

161
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,840
but we don't do research

162
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,270
because I would have a difficult time

163
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,490
convincing my rector to allow me to park

164
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:46,920
an a380 behind the university why do I

165
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,900
focus on cyber-physical systems why is

166
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,730
this different from everything that has

167
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,990
happened before because this has

168
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,740
happened before and it will happen again

169
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,030
well there's a few reasons the first

170
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,790
reason is that people see and perceive

171
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,620
physical things and they can immediately

172
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,000
perceive them as relevant more relevant

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,450
than other things we are computer geeks

174
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,380
we think data computers and applications

175
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,560
are relevant because that's what we do

176
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,410
but to people hacking into a bank system

177
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,700
is never going to be as imaginatively

178
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,170
bad as hacking into an airplane because

179
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,960
computer systems in banks don't scream

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,330
why they fall and it's right that people

181
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,030
find these more disconcerting people

182
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,860
find it disconcerting politicians

183
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,470
realized that the systems that maintain

184
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,090
our societies are actually critical and

185
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,220
this is not happen now Viviane Reding

186
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,040
was the vice president not as the

187
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,600
current Commission not of the previous

188
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,430
Commission but of the Commission before

189
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,940
that 10 years ago this was already on

190
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,110
the agenda of states for protecting the

191
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,400
citizens cyber-physical systems are

192
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
often safety critical and may involve

193
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,480
danger to human life for instance take

194
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,350
robots this is what robots look like

195
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,850
today mostly they are confined in a cage

196
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,940
if you open up this cage just called the

197
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,530
protected space the robot stops and it

198
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,300
doesn't stop because the computer tells

199
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
it to stop it stops because opening the

200
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,290
cage opens a relay and power is cut the

201
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,990
motors and brakes start to work

202
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,970
you can hack into those robots as much

203
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,410
as you want but as soon as somebody

204
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,330
opens up the protected space those

205
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,270
robots are going to stop now this robot

206
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,480
instead which is called yume it's

207
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,380
perfectly safe to work with it's gentle

208
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,110
it's never going to hurt a human it has

209
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,380
been designed so but since there is no

210
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,480
physical protection all of these safety

211
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,140
constraints are in software so securing

212
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,080
the software for these robots is less

213
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,880
critical from safety point of view that

214
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,740
securing the software for these robots

215
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,959
and this is the future of robotics not

216
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:33,420
this systems that are cyber-physical are

217
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,920
automated getting into a car without a

218
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,560
steering wheel and brakes that's a

219
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,390
concept by the way it's not a real car

220
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,649
yet but getting into there this is going

221
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,620
to require us a leap of faith which is

222
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,630
the same source as the fear that many

223
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,620
people have when they board an airplane

224
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,329
it's not fear of a tour fear of flying

225
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,480
it's the fear of loss of control on a

226
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,790
car you have the perception that if

227
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,540
something bad happens you can somehow

228
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,490
intervene and try to save yourself grab

229
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,240
the steering wheel

230
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,849
grab the end brake if the car still has

231
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,230
one which is a difficult proposition of

232
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,609
days if you're a ship you think that you

233
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,349
can at least try to jump into the sea as

234
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,429
well but if you were on a plane you

235
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,820
can't do anything that's the root of the

236
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,990
fear of many people now this is fear of

237
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,250
automation an automation has always

238
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,840
evoked fear those are pictures that some

239
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,520
people in the room will recognize and

240
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,280
some people in the room want because of

241
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,390
age again yes of course it's all about

242
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,050
age but this is from war games so since

243
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,470
it's the

244
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,530
from 1984 if I recall correctly and and

245
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,600
it meant not spoiler in the last season

246
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,480
of Game of Thrones I think I can safely

247
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,669
talk about it but if you have not seen

248
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,640
it you should and for many people of my

249
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,860
generation that's the first time we saw

250
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,590
a hacker on screen hacking into a system

251
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,750
and he clicked right it clicked I'm

252
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,250
looking at you because you're the only

253
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,020
one that that kind of clicked with that

254
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:30,559
or maybe Yvette sorry but so it clicked

255
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,650
with us it was the first role model for

256
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,370
the ocular screen but you know what that

257
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,450
was not the point of the film the point

258
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,530
of work games

259
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,450
is fear of automation fear of what

260
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,309
happens when you transfer control of

261
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,530
nuclear weapons to this device here

262
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,500
which is a 1984 idea of what an

263
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,750
artificial intelligence looks like and

264
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,450
upon reflection maybe the artificial

265
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,039
intelligence was actually better than

266
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,480
the current controller of US nuclear

267
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,100
weapons but that would leave this

268
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,390
keynote in a different direction so

269
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,960
let's let's leave it as a side thought

270
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,710
now fear of automation is deeply inset

271
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,350
in us and the only way to get around it

272
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,600
is to create trust in people now people

273
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,320
expect computers not to work so they

274
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,049
will expect our beautiful self-driving

275
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:27,559
cars

276
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,590
not to work that's not a great start for

277
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,309
the self-driving car industry so we

278
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,010
cannot keep the circus going because

279
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,590
showing that we can hack into a jeep and

280
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,750
drive off the road adjourns from remote

281
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,330
is only going to help to a point it's

282
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,530
going to drive a point home stunt hacks

283
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,460
are important because there is awareness

284
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,020
they make people look and say oh that

285
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,890
can happen well but then comes the

286
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,070
question the big question what do I do

287
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,000
to avoid that from happening and we

288
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,650
cannot keep were throwing the spinning

289
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,539
the balls around and passing on to the

290
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,460
next system and say hey you know that it

291
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,140
happens also to the other system and

292
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,210
look it happens also over there

293
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,220
over there behind you a monkey with

294
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,560
three heads we cannot do that we cannot

295
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,430
do that and stand taxes focus on

296
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,110
specific vulnerabilities that's their

297
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,980
shortcoming

298
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,350
so there's vulnerabilities in everything

299
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,020
that's pretty much a given but the point

300
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,200
is so we cannot really prove any point

301
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,850
by proving that there's a vulnerability

302
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,620
or a hundred the point is if Vernor

303
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,490
abilities are denser so if there's many

304
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,740
vulnerabilities if they are sparse you

305
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,780
point that vulnerability packs

306
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,330
vulnerability squash bag problem solved

307
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,050
if they are denser and they are being

308
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,720
put into code faster than we can take

309
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,910
them out of code finding vulnerabilities

310
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,270
is completely pointless of course if you

311
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,610
find one you raise the problem you get

312
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,310
the problem solved of course if you find

313
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,760
an entire class of problems as Daniel

314
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,990
and other colleagues around the world

315
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,240
did four processors that's great because

316
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,000
you actually engage a process for

317
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,890
eliminating a class of vulnerabilities

318
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,640
but a single vulnerability is not really

319
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,300
important this part is from a keynote by

320
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,310
dan gear than gear is one of the

321
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,440
greatest minds of cyber security if you

322
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,420
have one hour of your life to spend well

323
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,420
find this keynote at blackhat USA 2014

324
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,630
and look it entirely for the next 19

325
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,250
minutes you are stuck with me I'm sorry

326
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,250
that's just as good but um so we are not

327
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,020
going to solve anything by squashing

328
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,150
vulnerabilities one at a time and this

329
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,500
is not a new lesson this is an older

330
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,170
lesson this is a message from years ago

331
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,020
from bizalbert that is a great kernel a

332
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,110
current exploiter and it's basically

333
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,820
saying the same thing bugs don't matter

334
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,560
vulnerability research is the

335
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,150
way to approach this is not trying to

336
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,460
get the bugs out of the kernel is trying

337
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,140
to make sure that whenever there is a

338
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,060
bug in the kernel it doesn't lead to

339
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,400
complete compromise of the system so

340
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,570
easily you need to design systems

341
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,570
around basically stopping the routes of

342
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,880
impact of the vulnerabilities not the

343
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,350
routes to the vulnerabilities because

344
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,820
the routes to the vulnerabilities cannot

345
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,330
be stopped completely and this is a

346
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,660
lesson that we have already learned and

347
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,530
we should avoid to learn it again by

348
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,360
having planes and cars crash we should

349
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,570
avoid to have to learn it again

350
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,070
now vulnerability research in order to

351
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,280
be useful for this needs systemic

352
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,910
context it needs to understand what are

353
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,940
the impacts what are the results of the

354
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,740
attacks do you remember this that's

355
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,640
precisely what's in there it's pointless

356
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,500
to say that there is a vulnerability in

357
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,180
a piece of software on the plane if you

358
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,950
don't know what this will do to the

359
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,420
plane or if it will do anything at all

360
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
to the plane because and I realize that

361
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,550
I'm talking to computer engineers here

362
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,610
and you are unsympathetic to me for what

363
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm going to say but I'm a computer

364
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,440
engineer myself and I'm going to say

365
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,180
computers do not matter in cyber

366
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,420
physical systems systems matter if the

367
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,650
computer can be compromised who cares if

368
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,710
the system does not is not affected by

369
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,910
that who cares

370
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,180
so in order to fix this I don't have the

371
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,650
recipe because otherwise I would be out

372
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,690
there doing it and making a lot of money

373
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,970
from it instead I'm here stuck keeping

374
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,380
you on the chairs and being a professor

375
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,070
but I have a couple of suggestions for

376
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,990
other people to do as it's a typical

377
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,610
professor style one of them comes from

378
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,000
our own research so I can bash myself

379
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,940
without without fear of retribution than

380
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,780
with say different ran micro and with my

381
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,700
wonderful students and ex students

382
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,890
Davide marchello Mario and with my

383
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,890
colleague under a blanket in this is a

384
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,860
research on robots

385
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,420
and you may have seen it or maybe have

386
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,520
not there's a recording of it you can go

387
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,440
and see it I'm not going to spend a lot

388
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,230
of time on it but we presented it at

389
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:55,799
blackett in the series Federico and I

390
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,130
marchello and Davide put on their red

391
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,559
noses and started performing in front of

392
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,809
the circus and this is what the circus

393
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,590
cheer for we found that inside the robot

394
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,710
the basically the robot does not check

395
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,830
signatures and updates my cell phone

396
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,299
does and these half a ton 70,000 euros

397
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,510
worth of machinery does not so whatever

398
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:28,230
you load it loads and executes it it

399
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,490
does use and secure protocols so you can

400
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,929
affect this upload system and the circus

401
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:42,750
cheer right whoo-hoo there's an even

402
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,750
path where if you place a and aptly

403
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,240
named the file you can reconfigure the

404
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,190
operating system underlying the robot

405
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,710
whoo-hoo there's this in the code triple

406
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,850
cheer from the audience because this is

407
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,299
basic I don't know technically folks

408
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,309
your hair I suppose pretty much say I'm

409
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,690
not going to dive into an explanation

410
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,750
but this is basically on this lights of

411
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,190
your secure programming 101 what not to

412
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,090
do classes it's a straight buffer

413
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,690
overflow from the 90s and since it is on

414
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,520
a system that does not have any memory

415
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,280
protections any randomization any

416
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,590
non-executable stack you can exploit it

417
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,510
pretty much as in a smashing the stack

418
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,710
for fun and profit it works so triple

419
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,690
share from the audience for the

420
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,669
cybersecurity circus this doesn't matter

421
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:43,410
none of these matters because this is

422
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,440
mold block here says that ABB that is

423
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,179
the vendor of the robot has patched it

424
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,910
so it doesn't matter anymore

425
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,520
who cares this is what mattered that

426
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,780
they in

427
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,360
but of this on the press was catastrophe

428
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,070
warning what's an industrial robot get

429
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,980
hacked watch hackers that was us

430
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,440
sabotage an industrial robot arm and

431
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,920
finally my top favorite of the bunch

432
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,230
hackers are remotely controlling

433
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,510
industrial robots now oh my god what's

434
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,330
going to happen this is going to happen

435
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,190
that's what the people draw from this

436
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,560
and it's not the message the freakin

437
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,360
message was in the next section of the

438
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,010
paper that was evidently too academic

439
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,670
for anybody to read which was looking at

440
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,830
the post exploitation strategies because

441
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,810
you are never going to fix that code

442
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,840
base in a lifetime but you can make it

443
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
so that when somebody breaks into that

444
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,070
code base something that is going to

445
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,600
happen because it's going to be broken

446
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,170
for years and years to come they at very

447
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,580
least cannot kill anybody

448
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,390
and we can do that by reducing the

449
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,350
attack surface after the exploitation

450
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,120
changing the architecture improving

451
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,860
resilience for instance checking the dam

452
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,530
thermal signatures this kind of things

453
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,900
can be done and then came reduced the

454
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:08,460
impact that an attacker can have so this

455
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,860
is a first suggestion we need to focus

456
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,970
on impact resilience strategies

457
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,360
architectural changes and second we need

458
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,120
to embed the security into the design

459
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,810
process and we need to use a risk driven

460
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,140
extreme and method let me use all the

461
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,680
motive for an example I didn't think how

462
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,330
embarrassing it would be to do this

463
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,040
keynote in front of Andrea right here

464
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,110
because this kind of the topmost expert

465
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,949
on what I'm talking about

466
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,440
so there's been multiple hacks and

467
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,950
attacks on cars for years there's been

468
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,240
Charlie and Chris but there's been a

469
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,640
bunch of others and you know what these

470
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,090
attacks are all the same attack you find

471
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,210
an exploit on the attack surface of the

472
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,440
outside of the vehicle

473
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,740
typically the infotainment system remote

474
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,130
firmer of data or equal box

475
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,360
this is connected to the can network

476
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,160
once you are inside the vehicle it's

477
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,780
your vehicle this is the security

478
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,169
assumption of vehicles and so it's done

479
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:22,860
when you can do that when you can do

480
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,740
that you have taken the vehicle you can

481
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,620
drive it away you can influence its

482
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,710
operations you can modify it permanently

483
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,590
extract personal information you can do

484
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,600
anything because the vehicle is made of

485
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,880
hundreds of computers that trust each

486
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,330
other

487
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,220
so once you've broken into one you've

488
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,870
broken into all of that list so all of

489
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,320
these attacks are the same attack now if

490
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,450
we focus on the vulnerability the

491
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,919
vulnerability is the first step of this

492
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,409
attack and there's always going to be

493
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,320
vulnerabilities in particular insistence

494
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,600
that were not designed to be exposed to

495
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,690
the Internet

496
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,510
however the defense circus is sometimes

497
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,520
better than the exploitation circus

498
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,049
because if you focus on the

499
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,510
vulnerability as for instance FCA did

500
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,460
but because they had no other way to do

501
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:14,700
it

502
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,840
tame like snail mail and instructed them

503
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,970
to put it into the vehicle and at the

504
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,400
viewing everyone go to the to the

505
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,070
dealers for maintenance and people to

506
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,169
actually slum and in USB HIDA comes into

507
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:33,240
the mail inside the vehicle now the

508
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,340
point securing the vehicle now does this

509
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,280
change our way to design vehicles now

510
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,250
trusted network this is going to happen

511
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,500
over and over again we can park a

512
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,390
vehicle here in front don't do it on any

513
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,159
vehicle that is not yours but this car

514
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,559
park a vehicle here in front and hack

515
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,669
together on it so the typical suggestion

516
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:59,220
of most researchers is yeah all we need

517
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,240
to do is get rid of can at which point

518
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,530
automotive act for other reasons and in

519
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,179
geological times it's not going to

520
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,980
happen tomorrow then it's

521
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,660
academic research says that if that

522
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,669
tries to come up with magic and vision

523
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,470
detection systems using machine learning

524
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,980
I was a bit ahead of time probably they

525
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,559
didn't work I can tell you safely now in

526
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,179
my professor nobody cares about my PhD

527
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,110
thesis anymore

528
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,940
they didn't work they didn't work back

529
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,429
then then don't work now and they will

530
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,490
not work in the future I can tell you I

531
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,950
designed them with didn't work and

532
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,470
surely they will never work enough for

533
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,750
an automotive manufacturer to place

534
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,549
trouble if the your intrusion detection

535
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:43,980
system cannot stop the attacks because

536
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,500
nobody in their same mind will allow it

537
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,250
to stop a comment to your brakes what

538
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,870
can they do do they make a light blink

539
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,490
on your dashboard with a guy in a

540
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,030
balaclava hacking on and keyboard and

541
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,250
what do you do when the hacker I can

542
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,960
lights up on the dashboard

543
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,059
do you drive to the side of the road and

544
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,059
call the police

545
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,320
what are you a staff is supposed to do

546
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,030
with this information less it's

547
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,710
pointless or you can suggest that we go

548
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,260
ahead and penetration test our way out

549
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,809
of thousands of combinations of first

550
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,110
security problem we need to approach

551
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,750
this problem by performing safety

552
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,400
dreamchip code for most cyber physical

553
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,600
systems like to pick up a car there is

554
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,090
only for bad things that you may want to

555
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,710
towards people off board get the PII

556
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,799
that is on world get the intellectual

557
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,290
property that is on board there is

558
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,000
nothing else that you can want to do as

559
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,470
a protocol all those computers all those

560
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,750
interfaces they all lead up to these

561
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,030
four things so the attack tree the

562
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,640
threat assessment for these four things

563
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,460
is not difficult if you want to still

564
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,350
have equal you have three or four ways

565
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,049
to do it and these three or four ways

566
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:13,710
map specifically to certain issues and

567
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,860
to certain commands you can design your

568
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,710
vehicle thinking of these three these

569
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,320
are trees and create topologies that are

570
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,810
more resilient to this if you can have

571
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,740
the attacker achieving those four goals

572
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,630
the attacker can hack into whatever they

573
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:36,810
want and we do not care of course it's

574
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,760
an extreme right we still do care we

575
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,410
still want to protect us but if we at

576
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,000
least can avoid that the attacker

577
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,180
achieving those objectives we can

578
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,360
actually design safe vehicles to drive

579
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,070
we can actually design safe planes to

580
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,400
fly as it has already been done we need

581
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,900
to look at the industries where this has

582
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,740
already been done

583
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,080
avionics is a good example of course the

584
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,030
problem with those approaches is that

585
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:10,380
they take time they incur costs but this

586
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,770
cost is what we need to pay if we want

587
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,239
to have systems that are trustworthy

588
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,940
enough for people to jump into a car

589
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,830
without a steering wheel and actually

590
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:24,060
reach safely their destination so in

591
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,570
conclusion I think we focus way too much

592
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,040
an attack research and I'm an attack

593
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,440
researcher for drive sex if I tell you

594
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,300
that we focus too much on what I do for

595
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,360
a living probably you may need to listen

596
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,350
to me I'm not doing the cheater or

597
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,230
Adamas we're doing Cicero against his

598
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:50,250
home vulnerabilities in the grand scheme

599
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,270
of things do not matter they have

600
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,440
absolutely no meaning and stunt hacking

601
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,340
is useful to a point when we go beyond

602
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,440
that point stand hacking is just

603
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,770
dangerous and reckless it's showing off

604
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,260
in circus artists who show off too much

605
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,900
tend to end up badly

606
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,850
so this cyber security circles need to

607
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,510
stop at some point and I think we are

608
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,790
way past at some point we need to focus

609
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:32,060
all changes on reducing the impact of

610
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,980
vulnerabilities that's what we need to

611
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,410
focus on it's

612
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,320
not going to happen as long as we keep

613
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,190
rewarding and publicizing only attack

614
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,750
research I thank you very much for your

615
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,150
attention and if you have any questions

616
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,530
I'm here to take them you can ask let me

617
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,320
Italian if you're shy

618
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:10,099
[Applause]

619
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,870
okay I guess that I was either too

620
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,750
boring or too explicated so either very

621
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,300
good or very bad thank you very much for

622
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,250
your attention

623
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:31,809
[Applause]
