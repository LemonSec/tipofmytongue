18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,010

minute to say I wanted to thank everyone

us we did the conference

63
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,349
and for us so it's time to

64
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,069
celebrate

65
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,680
so  you exit the certain congresses

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
turn left then go north you go

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,219
up walk for a hundred meters you pass the

68
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,199
traffic light and there is about twenty on the

69
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,750
small right and you see a pope called

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,620
virtual pad

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,269
so it is very easy to see you there life

72
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,859
martino we  done we thank

73
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,959
the sponsors again thanks to them that obviously

74
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,910
we are here so as stefano said

75
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,759
before we are the liking community so

76
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,960
the conference does not want to be

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,419
commercial but a compromise there must

78
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,849
always be feelings tuenti we

79
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,400
do not have a date yet

80
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,449
surely it will not be the beginning of September

81
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,159
seen they organize conferences  miss oh

82
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,530
september a bit complicated having august

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,990
that everything is closed so you are

84
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,610
thinking if maybe bring to before the

85
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,400
summer like early june

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,270
or  maybe later October you can see

87
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,610
clearly wanting to say

88
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,650
positioning

89
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,560
ourselves as an international conference we also have to see a

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,090
bit of the European calendar

91
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,190
to give you an example October is

92
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,940
impossible they are conferences like I don't

93
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,550
know who me box amsterdam in May to

94
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,860
October red black with  the black cat

95
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,759
europe, however, it is December is that the

96
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,610
box abu dhabi october there are a series

97
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,620
of sites in three dedicated precisely to the

98
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300
calendar of the security conferences and

99
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,789
if you think that every day there is an

100
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,979
event for example says b side zurigo

101
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,260
that it had to be  it seems to me

102
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,479
last week of days ago they were admitted more or

103
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,820
less in agreement not to do the verlato

104
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,800
but then they moved it and therefore some

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,389
of the speakers that I wanted to invite

106
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,370
for example of google zurich v security

107
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,229
zurich and they did not come because they were on

108
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,300
in zurich to present even in the

109
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,419
best let's say of the export of the

110
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,479
in the coordination is not easy we will

111
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,039
keep you informed as soon as we manage to

112
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,419
com  combine something thank you again for

113
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:58,630
being good

114
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,110
[Applause]
