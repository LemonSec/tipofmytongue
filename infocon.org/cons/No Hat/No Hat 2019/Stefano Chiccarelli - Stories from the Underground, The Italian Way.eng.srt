1
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,720
so thanks to everyone oh well it

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,150
was him so this slide

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,990
is useless

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,550
anyway I wanted to thank with

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,050
thanks first of all marco for this

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,490
opportunity because in any case he

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,199
asked me how explicitly to talk

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,840
about a historical period of the

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,579
Italian scene in particular I did from

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,590
his intervention to tell  a little about

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,150
the history of the leagues doing this

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,059
for several years after the book I

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,890
self-nominated myself to be the one who

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,739
sometimes tells what the story is and

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,350
therefore I am very happy with this a

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,089
little less because clearly if you

17
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,559
invited me to talk about this as

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,269
rightly he introduced me it means

19
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,900
that I am old

20
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,830
luigi stand this morning too but no more

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,390
chatter since I am old they

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,099
started from the 80s so the

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,610
eighties world games they

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,500
talked to me about even if they hold it was a bit

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,720
the spark that triggered

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,130
the  the idea that you could do certain things

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,479
with a computer one way in Italy

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,630
amounts to almost everything  ta my generation

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,939
the film of the eighty rate sorry to

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,310
make black but the black regency

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,600
is not an ancient everyday life

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,620
the addresses of this for all the

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,670
tweets and then look if the 83 and

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,830
clearly after after wargames we are

35
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,630
all a bit crazy  in search of modem the

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,310
modems were not there in italy 20645 it may

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,870
be the stuff of the rich ones of an

38
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,420
apple two husbands is because it cost a

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,060
lot and therefore in search of this

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,950
type of who was in other years son

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,360
was a teenager so who will be in

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,070
other university fields or not he

43
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,020
had access acoustic couplers things of

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,840
this type in the 80s

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,090
let's say in consumer computer science to

46
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,740
predore tastes cv never seen

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,360
there were assembly coupons for

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,640
the way of 300 baldi taking goals you

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,619
like means that the character  to

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,598
arrive I represent characters per

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,159
second so you can imagine and

52
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,500
then with these means

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,049
we start teaching and a

54
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,120
period begins that is defined that I

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,830
wrote in  my book that of the bbs

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,519
then bulletins trainees i.e. in the

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,810
bedroom each of us

58
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,200
put some of us had a

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,700
computer i.e. a telephone line for caravan modena

60
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,010
and allowed other

61
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,660
users who had computers and dying to

62
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,830
reconnect chat exchange files

63
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,690
make e-mail messages and

64
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,989
talk about  topics in

65
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,750
thematic discussion forums that is what is

66
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,890
done today but with a

67
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,580
truly basic technology in Europe there was the

68
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,500
chaos computer club that was already formed

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
this I say because in any case nothing is

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,690
invented everything I have seen that in this

71
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,709
sector we often forget  for the

72
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,709
story I don't have as if you have no memory

73
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,540
as if everything you can't find on

74
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,459
google never existed in reality

75
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,769
there were already some more important European realities

76
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:19,209


77
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,700
there was the chaos computer club with google

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll show you a hard certification  in

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,069
Dutch and in the late 80's there

80
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,290
was the first garatti cache

81
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,819
departi that gave way to the

82
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,560
Dutch ones  yes there was also an infiltration

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,720
from the side of the secret services

84
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,310
now this environment is the whole story

85
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,340
of kurt koch who died they made him

86
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,170
commit suicide let's say it is written in a

87
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,790
book called 23 I give these

88
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,590
indications to make you understand that forward

89
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,560
in the  80s what we read

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
every day that scares us today was not

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,670
that scene it was not the moon and from this

92
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,959
type of infiltration

93
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,209
we are clearly talking about the beginnings

94
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,950
of the dawn of the very first steps of

95
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,420
this speech

96
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,310
returning to Italy because of Italy we

97
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,030
have to  talk over the bds in

98
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,120
the mid-80s the sip because we are talking about

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,549
a service

100
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,380
called videotel that is similar friends of the

101
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,209
french begins to be activated so terminalini could

102
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,548
not be rented and I also wanted to connect

103
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,060
to love with particular protocols

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,389
for

105
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,360
and instead for  the truth

106
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,499
business italy had its own x25 network

107
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,249
called i tra pac

108
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,499
we are talking about a period in which there

109
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,379
was no inter there is internet there was  but

110
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,770
it was not given to the public that is

111
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,270
some universities in the late

112
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,629
80s in Italy and that's it and these were the

113
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:48,729
possibilities of connection cr the network

114
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,740
of the dear net the network of the

115
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,289
digital break and through these networks you

116
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,599
could get to some

117
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,430
messaging servers and  above all two

118
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,169
important ones in the history of leggings

119
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,229
because we are talking about the underground of

120
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,529
security so the others jump high

121
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,150
because not a pair of twin servants

122
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,069
who were in germany and cures of who

123
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,870
was in france were messengers

124
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,689
that is chats that arrived up there

125
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,759
for the first time  Italians also turn

126
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,819
to European and American ones we begin to

127
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,680
talk about certain techniques

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,469
let's talk about ways that because at the time

129
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,539
one of these systems was reached must necessarily

130
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,729
be a hacker because in

131
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,500
any case you had to have

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,659
the equipment to connect you had to

133
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,490
have  the access to the net the packets

134
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,229
was not free that was not the reach

135
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,020
of all and you had to get it will be  à because

136
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,610
this existed we are talking about

137
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,289
very few hundreds of people in

138
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,710
europe in italy in those years they were

139
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,879
still born

140
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,639
so we will have my comfort 64 was

141
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,949
trying to connect pdl it was before the

142
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,919
period of my bbs on su mc link in

143
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,020
rome in particular it was created  of

144
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,180
friends in who was a Roman BBS linked to

145
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,479
a microcomputer that was a

146
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,979
computer newspaper that at the time to see the

147
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,930
news there was no internet buy the

148
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,080
magazines so it was an analog world

149
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,250
to get the things that came out you

150
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,930
had to read the magazines  to give the

151
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,699
photos then maybe after two years at the

152
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,960
milestone smau a completely different period

153
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,729
but there were already a series of people

154
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,550
which is one of the nice nicknames of the

155
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,319
time was tadpole package which was

156
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,729
one of the first who wrote a sort

157
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,279
of zin on  how to use the ita

158
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,870
pack network that are still around

159
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,969


160
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:39,299
because on the 5th of September the most

161
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,249
important group in that codified moment

162
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,429
whose me is not well known starts  mbri

163
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:46,469
was 20 and 22 2 which is a Milanese group

164
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:49,139
because 222 was the favorite of the

165
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,509
pac life addresses in milan

166
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,610
so we started announcing

167
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,139
in the eighties there must be this

168
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,749
type of situation within the bbs

169
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,729
instead the normal ones so this was

170
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,829
already an elite  of people who had

171
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,629
access will have a rarity

172
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,239
packet switching in people let's say more or

173
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,219
less they still could not

174
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,129
get to this type of technology

175
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,489
in the bbs there was a section a series of

176
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,769
activities there were the standard bbs of the

177
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,199
network videos that was  very clean with

178
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,549
very precise politicians if instead

179
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:22,709
they also come from bds who had

180
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,989
like me policies to infinity in large

181
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:28,110
arches and therefore did not have any kind

182
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,119
of policy of this type and on

183
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,249
which the pirated software was found,

184
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:32,999
i.e. wireless

185
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,629
so the first ones  versions of games the

186
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,129
possibility of downloading

187
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,489
pirated software all this story so it is

188
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,439
in order to do this the people who

189
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,519
had the m  whereby

190
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,349
some bbs are reached, which are often

191
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,539
in the united states and which in any case had costs that were

192
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,149
not directly accessible

193
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,619
take into account that the sip had the

194
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,659
urban rate at the time, that is, if you call

195
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,199
them a telephone district pay them a little by the

196
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,999
minute you call there out of that

197
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,579
the telephone district of the

198
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:05,039
cleaver fell because inter-continuity lines

199
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,799
vary where they were a lot so

200
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:09,809
in order to be able to arrive with modems in

201
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,699
america people if they equipped themselves

202
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,529
using a series of

203
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,899
border techniques then from the famous boxing

204
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,009
bees you have surely heard of

205
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,019
you have also seen peralta  in france it was

206
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,419
the way for the action of two photos the other

207
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,789
rich magic boxes the collin cards

208
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,759
that often came out of the italian born bases

209
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,129
naples palermo etcetera pillow

210
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,089
that according to rincalzi called

211
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,769
switchboard he was told what was the

212
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,198
number of those in the flesh he allows himself to

213
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,969
avoid  to a phone call to someone

214
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,159
who owned this policy

215
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,479
through these techniques to avoid

216
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,159
paying the bill arrived in the

217
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,349
United States that you downloaded the quartz and

218
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,509
made it available to the

219
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,080
users of your business

220
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,240
because I will tell you all these things

221
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,950
in this freedom because they are all

222
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,530
crimes because it was not a crime

223
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,920
except the  offspring telephone was everything

224
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,800
else but it means down

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,010
but then I didn't do menica yo yo yo their

226
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,670
story to everyone by coface nevano to

227
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,430
tell it is in any case everything else

228
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,350
was not a crime because

229
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,190
illegally entering the border of another

230
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,690
copy and pass on

231
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,640
some recently protected software  direct etc.

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,260
were not regulated in Italy we are

233
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,510
talking about it was not prior to 93 which

234
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,340
was the moment in which they entered into

235
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,200
force that comes into force with a different

236
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,390
then and of the law of computer crime

237
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,340
and there was therefore not a crime and was not in the

238
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,680
least perceived  as a crime it

239
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,930
was important to understand in order to understand

240
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,330
what I tell you what was

241
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,230
not perceived there was no perception

242
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,120
s  ociale of those few hundred

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
people using these tools

244
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,480
is that they attract

245
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:13,990
who is this they hacked me so

246
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,870
I said there was no type of it was

247
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,370
perceived as a crime it was a game

248
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,649
we played with computers we had fun

249
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,230
with computers we liked connected to

250
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,970
other letters though  we start above all

251
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,560
with the chats and colorless america and

252
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,910
when we started talking to the

253
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,680
Germans of the French Dutch and there

254
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,540
began to be information on

255
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,639
how to enter certain systems and

256
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,949
through the x25 networks sometimes we could

257
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,190
not even get on that for  the era

258
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,180
was a mirage mirage so this

259
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,009
was a bit the situation of the 80s

260
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,170
of the bbs they grew then clearly to

261
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,699
end in the eighties the friends arrive it

262
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,040
was therefore commodore amiga who

263
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,690
were much more powerful they start to

264
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,769
be the first 286 models then ibm pc

265
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,230
compatible  it was starting to a

266
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,550
technology we can also move forward

267
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,970
so it was possible the modems and they went on

268
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,329
quickly from 302 bps 1200 2496 14.28

269
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:12,100
up to then get to 56k but there was

270
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,930
already from the internet

271
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,339
so we are doing

272
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:17,380
rigorous queens on file exchange it was much

273
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,040
faster and 100 so maybe it was a bit

274
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,899
of the 80's environment then bbs

275
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,060
some elites on mc link squared that

276
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,980
managed to arrive between knicks 25 on

277
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,380
certain messages listi that someone

278
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,750
who was a group who was freaking and

279
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,930
therefore almost with the bluebox both with

280
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,680
these systems that I told you before the

281
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,819
bds that chases on which they

282
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,579
exchanged information mass  from the

283
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,380
pirated software basically so

284
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,180
this was the scene there were no more

285
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,730
organized if not this dt and 222 was

286
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,740
another one called omega team in the

287
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,930
north or 12 on the groups I would go back to

288
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,149
omega tv is both very important as

289
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,189
you see things me  they told them

290
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:08,459
well

291
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,540
let's go on anyway to understand

292
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,770
how it was done to a bible be I

293
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,570
took a screenshot this pds I

294
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,890
still have it and do tel net with a client c  he

295
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,080
supports the launch of bb be as a graphic

296
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,250
you find yourself so you can make

297
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,320
the account there is this risk the names that are

298
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
not there after setting up create

299
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,640
your account from that moment on there is

300
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,310
also the mail in power  without encryption

301
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,710
without anything these are really

302
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,060
homogeneous there were perches

303
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,440
I didn't leave it because I wanted to

304
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,080
try to see it and through these

305
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,030
bbs we all get in touch with a

306
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,410
series of American documents for the

307
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,180
numbers of between that represses of magazines  the

308
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,120
first we are the first yes in the first and

309
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,860
above all we come into contact with

310
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,020
this I put the photo of colom it was

311
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,320
as it was now so we come into

312
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,810
contact with the ape car manifesto of

313
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,940
the 80s of an element that elected today may

314
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,780
seem like a  what a little from the film he

315
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,090
said before but Latvian in

316
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,610
the late 80s on the early 90s on

317
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,140
my generation certainly had a

318
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,150
very important impact that we can

319
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,550
summarize my first in curiosity

320
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,570
because then in the end there  Oh yes, don't bother us

321
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,170


322
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,090
these queens people because in any case that

323
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,770
then we started talking precisely in the

324
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,270
early 90s that could not become

325
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,310
law we are interested in knowing this

326
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,350
type of technology we do not re there we do not

327
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,490
exist we find them are repeats and

328
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,500
therefore this is the  situation of the

329
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,440
80s briefly let's go to the 90s

330
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,660
the 90s are

331
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,250
exceptional years the 90s were the years in which

332
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,320
everything happened in Italy because it is

333
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,790
useless to deny it at least as

334
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,290
regards the seizure sector in which

335
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,600
we are talking now there are a series

336
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,379


337
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,859
of police operations that begin the year after

338
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,689
these are important to the Jews

339
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:01,869
immediately because they have stirred the

340
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:04,269
consciences of that hundred

341
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,859
enthusiasts at the time the first is hardware

342
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:10,689
one of the many cuts since 1994 so

343
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:15,389
at a certain point following 2 bps that

344
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,119
merged software  pirate

345
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,249
came into possession of the year of the styles

346
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,619
of vein which was the list of the

347
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:25,449
final knots which they make to seize  and a

348
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,720
hundred bds around Italy

349
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,249
yes that of the famous is so if this

350
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,359
hand all clearly of the

351
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:36,699
police were not yet they were not

352
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,499
aware of what was

353
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,209
happening then saying to lend themselves

354
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,559
computers and these both this year

355
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,049
whole room  and so this guy this

356
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,649
thing

357
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,689
moved a lot in fact I personally

358
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,829
open a bbs just let's say how as a

359
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,109
reaction it is before he is a bs lover who

360
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,449
did things starting with the

361
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:56,439
waist because at that moment

362
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,600
more details that they had a modem and

363
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,399
a computer was seen as  a

364
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,939
criminal

365
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:03,189
this was a bit simply leaves a

366
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,179
way in a computer

367
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,279
definitely not easy to say good things

368
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,889
which a bit really true in the sense that

369
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,249
really

370
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,940
from 100 that if you in the early 90's c

371
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,110
have a computer and a modem and

372
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,850
surely because i don't know speaking  that

373
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,230
now it is fashionable that we all have

374
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,970
that nerds and are children that at the time

375
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,430
there are those who do these things were seen as a

376
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,320
misfit a person  who did not speak

377
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,430
of, however, was seen as a

378
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,839
misfit with a person who did not

379
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,639
have social relationships who closed

380
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,480
the keyboard lens

381
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,130
was a particular moment for this

382
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,560
type of character but let's go back to the new one

383
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,220
because for ten minutes they are provided

384
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,300
then immediately then stress

385
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,459
would remain instead  it is the first

386
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,130
police operation series a in italy that there is

387
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,829
a forest one stops and makes the trial and

388
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,329
arrests in some cases some of the

389
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,250
characters as people who were

390
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,959
really doing intrusions abuses

391
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,990
the famous maybe we were tooth is that

392
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,850
of raul for  understand that the church which is

393
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,620
the only one but there were also others

394
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,089
together then because they passed a little

395
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,699
more low profile rightly raul and

396
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,029
then the armed phalanx started and

397
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:13,100
painting it happened so there was a

398
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,380
moment in which they took these  people

399
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,180
for the first time in Italy who had

400
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,850
committed an abusive intrusion and there was

401
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,220
a whole series of there were a whole

402
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,839
series of podium repercussions for  this

403
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,810
thing because in any case minimal film after

404
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,029
the hackers who actually trauma

405
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,889
objectively on systems because then

406
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,860
they parked then they

407
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,250
admitted their guilt and

408
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,040
we decided to fish we decided to

409
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,269
put graphics is the oldest

410
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,760
currently cestaro network but yes

411
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,230
it deals with

412
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,970
something else let's say look we have to create something

413
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,579
one to try not to go to jail

414
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,360
here because so the bbs is the

415
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,220
communication tool of an association and

416
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,230
above all we have to disclose this

417
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,569
I do short going forward let's start

418
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,819
doing what was still the should

419
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:03,649
be  one of the first

420
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,599
conference collaborations that we called lacker and the

421
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,579
magistrate were there and that is with me there was

422
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,079
also andrea monti in that very

423
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,949
active period of view of IT law

424
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:17,459
and we start from 95 to 99 four editions

425
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,609
for human are we were 12 13 people

426
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,309
then gradually it grew until in 99 and

427
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,079
you to access the photos the audience

428
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,199
was remarkable there was mass  arini captains of

429
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,549
all the people that to the bees then

430
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,190
we start we do not look out to talk

431
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,700
hackers with the magistrate on duty then

432
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,520
or with a point at that moment it was

433
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,789
chest was still in finance in a

434
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,120
moment of opening so we try to

435
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,710
confront ourselves we did see the

436
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,520
attacks  we do for the naivety of the

437
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,020
first two years we showed

438
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,990
real attacks that is from servers well that is

439
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,409
we did not have no but this no but I do not

440
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:01,409
say it for where I want you I have to

441
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:02,789
get into the question in his

442
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,460
ration aragon tires at the end of

443
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,080
building these  years of having

444
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,669
magistrate that andrea we decide that it is

445
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,350
here we must even write something and we will

446
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,840
write spaghetti to you who has in

447
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,200
fact made you the fruit of these years of

448
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,429
confrontation with a whole series of people

449
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,289
by having in fact still write the

450
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,120
cradle to the grave or the city  Italian

451
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,590
we had stories written by the many

452
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,460
people

453
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,500
who wrote it name and surname nickname

454
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,480
yesterday it remained so we did  or

455
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,220
a collection of stories to try to

456
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,200
launch projects of pleasure something

457
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,559
in the same years in parallel along the

458
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,890
lines of frac know that between crisis

459
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,250
but that I wanted to explain in fact it is the

460
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:48,419
magazine the oldest electronic of c has

461
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,210
been the whole history of

462
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,909
world making passed through  the pages of

463
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:56,909
frac which is still active in

464
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,149
different ways and modalities farati punto org ph with

465
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,640
dedication of the historian etc. and therefore

466
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
also in Italy things are started to be

467
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,659
produced and back pages often have and

468
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,429
with baglioni a they will spread and then

469
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,710
ebe file  well file that it was the magazine

470
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,320
the Italian laws around the

471
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,840
aphasia wound square in many I

472
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,309
personally the m guys that we simply have an

473
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,080
external supporter in the

474
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,539
sense that I was already working and that I am

475
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,520
old and I will have older

476
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,080
andrea monti we had a lawyer

477
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,760
we did not pay for it so we are there for the

478
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,860
domain and girded we were a series of

479
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,200
things to allow these people who

480
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,549
in many cases still do not even  to me

481
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,039
we know live to be able to express

482
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,179
these things

483
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,279
today we talk about bile fi the north

484
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,980
european campan in code be there in the 93 hackers

485
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,419
keeping the last verses and then

486
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,169
company in the 98 online eating italian

487
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,970
the photo you see above of the killing

488
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,610
of florence of 98 the one in  bottom with the

489
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,620
always program to mention the thing of the

490
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,139
porter is me and he cried there are already a

491
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,669
thousand of them so it is one of the very rare

492
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,409
photos of chemistry and 98 I did not see that

493
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,070
we are doing

494
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,230
then okay one there is a series of groups

495
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,600
so  this is the period in which

496
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,399
hackers isolated because they were often

497
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,940
isolated and in some cases they decide to

498
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,730
create groups of more than groups

499
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,639
often in bookshops because, however,

500
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:20,340
small elite groups helped at the

501
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,820
time and therefore this happens almost

502
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,470
everywhere to fall in  america with a

503
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,020
warm loft www1 case of becoming

504
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,340
president of the united states courses

505
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,380
candida not written a book soon

506
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,110
those for the calculation of football happens

507
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,500
in europe with th  c lsd teso ferno great

508
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,389
dm lei etc.

509
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:42,000
and it also happens in italy with

510
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,850
anti-theft software of bad lensi freaknet

511
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,830
from the glass association girl is high

512
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,680
but let's go forward

513
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,960
the 90s scenario branch see some

514
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,730
photos of the time some things

515
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,560
of the  euro that so I recall others a

516
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,920
little at the first I see it 80 this

517
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,520
based on my research is the first notice

518
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,130
that has ever arrived in Italy for

519
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,790
issues related to abusive intrusions

520
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,410
or deletes the surname because in any case

521
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,820
that this person was we know

522
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,260
many do not  he is no longer gone 18.93

523
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,210
they have printed rare but if you notice the

524
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,830
640 cp and the more that it is a scam what

525
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,120
makes you more other than man we see

526
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,520
charges he is and he is more than others

527
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,690
so complicated is the knock of  us

528
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,820
because they were the passwords use the

529
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,920
network it up has a clean face the names that

530
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,390
have made huge bills for some

531
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,400
king and municipal body which then is the one that

532
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,470
enters the bank of the Roman organs

533
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,380
one of the first arc of history

534
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,210
I wanted to show

535
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,340
this to us because this person is very important for the

536
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,590
scene of the 90s this unpublished

537
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,300
normal card therefore group of europe no

538
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,770
this is instead italian catinat also a

539
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,090
book by carlo dubious which is

540
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,310
also found on the net where the countdown is concerned

541
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,920
of the bbs you can read it

542
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
in depth here now if instead it

543
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,630
is some stuff of the millinger arches and

544
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,580
that the arches meeting is born of

545
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,160
social precedents because the

546
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,070
social centers that had the bbs were very

547
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,600
attentive and present life and will offer a

548
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,910
space to this community

549
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,770
but it was not entirely a community of

550
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,290
activism they were a technical community that

551
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,730
used the spaces it is said so

552
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,590
many years in all the bars to the

553
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,710
good or bad so the chemistry

554
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,780
also starts with another stronger look we

555
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,890
must participate actively

556
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,050
for many  years with the m graphics cleaning

557
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,850
bathrooms and company at the first to whom I

558
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,290
meet then at a certain point there was a

559
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,300
sort of mini car that separate  the leader

560
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,860
better than a lot he punished her

561
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,390
by kidnappings still in my opinion it

562
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,530
is something that there must be

563
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,620
the activision by now has become moreover

564
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,970
lactis mini

565
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,530


566
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,190


567
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,440
fast then oh well spaghetti again

568
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,580
I'll show you in the three versions

569
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,280
because anyway here we tell

570
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,870
this period in a little more

571
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,730
detailed way this is the name of andrea

572
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,800
monti in the various versions now that is

573
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,170
the last one we have so it is andrea

574
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,930
who is  returning to publish but

575
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,710
going ahead of hackers clearly

576
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,140
only using only nicknames

577
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,760
but a pole of stuff we will keep

578
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,670
putting mario which is the one of two

579
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:38,180
photos can do that take the cele mario

580
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,180
was known as many nicknames

581
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,270
eclectic character taxman and mario

582
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,610
you have to understand  one thing if the rais

583
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,650
saif does what he does, I pay the

584
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,050
mortgage 70 to other people we know, it

585
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,370
is his merit,

586
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,580
that is, he started us  everyone in

587
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,670
italy of that generation had

588
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,280
knowledge connections had the rouxes between the

589
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,930
various accounts on the machines of elle.it

590
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,270
I saw him do things that you humans

591
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,400
I knew him so after many

592
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,170
attempts he managed to get into fabio

593
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,030
switch h point it  that you do not need to

594
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,980
be elections yesterday gym of the dead of

595
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,500
that generation via modem with an

596
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,480
account of a researcher who had

597
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,320
also loaned him mini condominiums made the

598
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,600
channel at night fable finally it was

599
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,390
an ics I could go out on the internet mini

600
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,240
that gets to talk from ruth because  it is a little

601
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,720
program that we want it will no

602
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,330
longer be used but to make cup between two types of

603
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,670
juan also two of them can be created

604
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,980
last is taken a damn [ __ ]

605
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,430
all night very

606
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,580
dangerous I answer and it was he who

607
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,760
explains to me that it was all the case the hole in

608
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,740
a character  who had access and

609
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,990
gave us access to the former politician the period

610
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,240
that they were not therefore what to think today but in

611
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
any case that is not an information

612
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,870
even more difficult to repe  rire at that

613
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,090
time anyway then there are a series

614
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,710
I put them there by geographical areas

615
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,380
nor do you not get pissed but because then

616
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,940
somebody gets angry here but

617
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,990
yes yes but let's say for for reasons

618
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,110
let's say today let's say frequentation

619
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:26,000
oh well beard has always loved  she will stay in st

620
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,750
milano

621
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,910
and then that Milanese we also have to operate the

622
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,620
channel rai naviga they are not

623
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,260
Milanese but let's say how giulia

624
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,940
communicates beyond these that it is not

625
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,770
that they are all there are many others

626
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,500
I had to do some slides chosen so then I

627
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,630
am elderly so the  memory that

628
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,380
is, however, it is not yet strong instead for the groups

629
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,620
we return unpublished 22 omega team respects

630
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,940
the degree method

631
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,530
now of the bad lances and it did not last very

632
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,060
long even officially but

633
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,500
it was very important in the history of

634
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,140
many top djs which is what will then

635
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,870
arrive on pc  he who was

636
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,820
probably from one of the most

637
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,910
active groups who was the one who cared

638
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,690
also be part of which he that

639
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,010
that of quero therefore does not tra

640
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,690
it  aliano del craking duty all the

641
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,060
most important seat reverses in italy

642
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,560
let's say rheineck game i'm

643
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,800
not luigia had it of her dyslexics

644
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,120
because then they became strong

645
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,580
yet anti strong there is strong front of the

646
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,310
site the best of technique if I

647
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,360
'm not mistaken two renault then  but

648
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,760
since I knew in fact that he always

649
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,610
stops six young people and he said

650
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,500
almost everyone angry so anyway

651
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,180
these are groups that were

652
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,070
very very important

653
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,900
the race the magistrate I put a couple

654
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,090
of photos on those in the upper left c  'is

655
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,520
also someone in will so there is a

656
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,210
bit of m graphics there a bit of rises a bit

657
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,510
mixed how much do you think it was the

658
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,760
conference instead I andrea monti and some

659
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,430
soft pj without overdoing it no the field

660
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,110
I start immediately because what  it

661
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,540
happened in 2004 for now it has been land

662
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,230
that splits from the clearing machine

663
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,520
doctors always said at the assemblies if

664
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,100
you want to change the technical I like

665
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,550
you do veil and I did it

666
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,780
now instead suc  this diaspora always gave up

667
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,150
so let's do it in

668
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,550
my opinion and I want to break a lance in

669
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,300
favor in this case if the camp nou

670
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,010
per was also the first event of

671
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,990
the Italian underground scene that with

672
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,730
sponsors the sponsor cone with companies in

673
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,680
the sponsor sector clearly I was already working on

674
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,630
it  had started working so

675
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,130
many millions already started working

676
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,990
so it was more however our

677
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,630
sponsorship like the one that is

678
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,190
here today to understand it is like there are

679
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,810
in other events now there is a

680
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,670
non-invasive sponsorship that is not

681
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,500
c  'it was the booth of the companies that

682
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,690
sponsor but they were of the companies that

683
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,150
had understood why maybe

684
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,800
sponsoring this community was could

685
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,900
be useful so at least that I

686
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,200
remember before in fashion they had no

687
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,480
obvious facts that created a

688
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,930
national debate sold only the sponsors

689
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,640
would invoke a little  of photos of that

690
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,010
period Marco's famous swimming pool

691
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,580
remembers flash partners pool even here I was there for a

692
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,290
few years  that therefore if the photo of

693
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:32,510
someone who is in the room anyway at

694
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,900
this event because it was an event

695
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,150
for Italy surely we have

696
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,460
been released at the expense of the

697
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,390
graphic meter I want to say it of the bsa and

698
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,370
paper that is the electronic magazine

699
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,070
to the press but it was a little advice

700
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,600
there were still the ago for the photo for

701
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,340
the occurrence

702
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,670
and the moment we release this

703
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,650
thing that everyone knew that maybe there was

704
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,880
and is not this

705
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,639


706
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,890
[Applause] it

707
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:34,230
was the 90s and the people

708
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,620
very particular the choice of the

709
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:57,539
brand happiness is understood the farm and to know

710
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,540
so this is the release that I have

711
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,220
this from my private archive

712
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,060
no absolutely not absolutely

713
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,410
then I want to show that this other

714
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,790
thing because according to her and makes

715
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,620
the spirit very much  of those years

716
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,620
this is the skinny a person that many

717
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,010
know that when I say I was not

718
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,640
here he will have placed something perhaps the

719
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,380
Saracen mocha proposals place of

720
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,760
these he calls him rai radiouno to make him

721
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,340
a '  interview on the phone the range of

722
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,250
users are always agents driven

723
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,820
by cars capello i liked

724
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,960
color snapped up airplanes consort of

725
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,410
computer science like capello or close

726
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,120
with an appendix of the face that you

727
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,840
spend more than me

728
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:11,899
this and on youtube even then then

729
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:14,059
I wanted to show why

730
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:15,710
beyond that the things that the smi says his middle

731
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,710
name really tell

732
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,450
what the relationship of that generation was

733
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,120
with the computer because

734
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,240
they were talking about computers but there is also a little

735
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,250
rai on the phone of the  interview him that

736
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,559
technique of saying serious things and a

737
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,490
bunch of songs laughing about the things

738
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,620
I said divided so the seriousness of

739
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,289
the technical things of a certain type but

740
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,090
never take himself too seriously

741
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,200
in the context in war other quick photos

742
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,779
which norm cameli not even  it happens in

743
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,279
football there is a photo below however of the

744
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,250
genre we have also met

745
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,480
mythical for our generation it

746
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,159
was a myth because now mitnick and

747
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,500
oh well it's meters  that everyone will be

748
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,029
wrong for this reason almost millions

749
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:01,850
did artists as peacekeepers

750
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,220
in the years in which he did not know the recent

751
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,620
he does not know very well what it was then that

752
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,840
you got help what you want

753
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,000
but in any case this has done things that i

754
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,220
for those years  they were anti-crisis instead

755
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,870
this is the photo to which I am shorter

756
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,880
linked to the colorado new land which then

757
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,220
died shortly after and who is the

758
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,470
founder of the chaos computer club of

759
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,149
the 80s so this was the chitina

760
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:35,600
milano in 98 ok seven years 2000 then

761
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,950
time that I told you all these

762
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,450
things many of us start working

763
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,400
in the field of the d series because it starts to

764
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,400
be there we say an interest but we are

765
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,020
at the dawn so penetration test

766
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,850
firewall configuration

767
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,850
no management and so on

768
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,830
the 11th of September completely changes

769
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,850
the situation

770
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,650
September 11th apart, which kills

771
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,600
all the movement that was born also

772
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,820
thanks to the basic telematics of

773
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,590
Italians in Genoa but beyond  he

774
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,100
politics on September 11 will

775
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,750
make Americans go crazy rightly

776
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,780
decided that security first and foremost and

777
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,520
this thing as you can imagine

778
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,610
has also had an impact on Europe and

779
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,159
Italy so since

780
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,870
2001 we start working in

781
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,490


782
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,900
IT security we start to  being the division from black

783
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,260
white hat the Italian im conferences

784
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,490
came out some very important things

785
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,669
like is for cup it was definitely a

786
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,210
tour that made history so there

787
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,530
will be many of us

788
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,120
starting to open small

789
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,740
companies starting to work  in

790
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,049
large companies that do not know if I am

791
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:43,070
still clear that if they are sure of hunger

792
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,250
for work there starts to be so many

793
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,250
kids taken directly from the tip

794
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,380
from these contexts queue start they are

795
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,450
beaten I will become companies to be

796
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,039
consultants so the moment a little that

797
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,860
the notifications in  scene l 0 of wines you

798
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,000
begin to understand that they have a market

799
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,950
because I did not live when death

800
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,390
things why  there is no time but in those

801
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,700
years we exchanged expo there were

802
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,880
repositories that had flyers that damon

803
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,710
nine had the iphone is between two in the

804
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,540
morning while the ex then so who

805
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,639
knew he went and will recover

806
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,139
I thought  a step food the sheath dress

807
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,000
of the ex then that I didn't have it that is there

808
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,320
was a world made a bit like that so they

809
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,440
could

810
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,109
therefore instead from a certain point onwards

811
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:26,069
this thing changes so the

812
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:27,960
unknown vulnerability starts to

813
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,969
become something that has a

814
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,550
market value begins to become both

815
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,879
the white market with the first initiatives that

816
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,800
black market between which changes

817
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,750
hands again and passes and then an American cycle ends

818
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,149
you can see that it ends right there

819
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,800
an American cycle ends are another

820
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,300
presentation that is sitting wolf  made

821
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,290
with and magic where I explain well the senate and

822
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,869
then we too begin to do

823
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,460
let's say this type of path towards

824
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,790
the company in 2000 he starts working

825
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,819
full time in security from 35 to

826
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:02,460
2008 penetration test and that's it with a

827
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,119
game

828
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,599
So, however, it changes the scenario a bit

829
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,760
and there are some

830
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,500
interesting activities that are here so

831
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,010
there is stuff they re-read stuff that the

832
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,390
first man inglis does who tries to put

833
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,970
together the world of

834
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,109
IT professionals with the under galan

835
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:21,690
computer scientist there is the black cats project

836
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,210
that many of them can talk about me

837
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,040
and that maybe did not have a long life did

838
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,310
not have

839
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,430
an end let's say big enemies but in

840
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,460
any case the underground is trying to

841
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,860
enter the fairs in the world of

842
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,450
security in the world  they knew nothing of the computer science that

843
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,010
raped for the security personnel

844
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,870
because they sold

845
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,150
millions and millions of euros of hardware

846
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,520
software that is the market of formentera

847
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,320
about true but the then in maga will

848
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,880
present etter representing black

849
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,400
uhuru then I desco them in the sky and  so

850
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,680
their tool goes around the world and in the

851
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,070
meantime arcade this thing in the

852
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,480
meantime and there was also zone ice which

853
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,660
however has also churned out many talents

854
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,750
even if  the casilino of the

855
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,510
telecom scandal is emblematic of the

856
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,470
years that is technical guys agar in good

857
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,190
faith in some cases but the skin in other

858
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,630
business managers was that they start to

859
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,950
do a certain type of profession

860
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,780
this stuff ends badly that they would

861
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,870
all end badly too  in

862
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,740
part

863
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,180
many of the elderly people of what they

864
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,070
work abroad are very good and

865
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,920
they have known to relocate someone

866
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,290
has big legal problems so from here

867
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,030
this event creates a big problem was

868
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,730
the Italian community because the

869
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,910
trust that until recently ends  it was there and it

870
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,600
was complete so from 2005 to 2015

871
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,660
everything becomes a little more nuanced the groups

872
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,030
begin to die

873
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,510
a summer cup

874
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,730
is born it is not that once the bad

875
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,260
is a beautiful thing because we say it was born

876
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,390
in 2005 so it is about to begin

877
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,110
other italian events grappa is called

878
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,000
ihc maneuver added as they are called to

879
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,770
others mocha to whom meeting and purge

880
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,990
then some have been kicked out knife

881
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,370
they kicked her out of meeting brands

882
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,540
because she comes from the cops

883
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,690
everyone knows and therefore she can't stand the

884
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,870
politicization that still creates

885
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,020
an extended hand free congratulations

886
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,240
years the active unveil news.va for

887
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,800
all that follows I wasn't there

888
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,090
much  time to talk about it then the VAT

889
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,320
in front of it fast because the rest

890
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,160
interests me more I made some

891
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,560
slides sweat the message I want to give

892
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,690
this from underground to cyber

893
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,520
security from these associations

894
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,650
people were born companies that went to

895
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,000
work in companies even a lot

896
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,750
important

897
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,220
maybe someone has also changed their name

898
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,010
in the meantime however however arose for

899
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,480
hodge and anti folk so these people

900
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,270
really and are dedicated to others others

901
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,250
have disappeared and therefore I don't know how they

902
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,770
will be dedicating but I would not swear

903
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,840
healthy things and many have managed to do

904
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,540
instead to  become create the market

905
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,790
enters the secure server market to

906
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,500
make it become what today have

907
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,060
been protagonists of anyway  this

908
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,310
so in our small way in italy

909
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,260
we were not born with trivial

910
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,450
what happens in america did not happen but it

911
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,940
happened that we did a business

912
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,950
we entered he will get fat between me I am

913
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,510
the CEO of

914
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,790
a company that suits you

915
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,300
something has happened  in those years

916
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,100
that led to this I will tell

917
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,650
you because you are the scene today so

918
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,110
at least part of the scene today because in

919
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,610
any case the scene died many years

920
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,630
ago but still relives from the under give

921
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,670
of the month I think that today it is not there

922
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,860
plus a big one but it's gone but not out of

923
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,690
malice because this stuff has

924
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,580
become the main stream that today it is enough

925
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,350
for one to say [ __ ] and all the

926
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,700
endings

927
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,120
what he said before seems that

928
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,220
on average they go crazy following things

929
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,000
that do not exist

930
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,580
so we have become there is no longer the

931
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,080
league cannot be bigger market

932
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,090
i.e. at the beginning for reasons of

933
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,970
seniority played i.e. age not today

934
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,190
there is no longer no der garde  cyber

935
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,980
security the lines are therefore also the type

936
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,670
of event that makes them set up

937
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,650
but this does not mean that the principles

938
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,690
values and the fact of having small

939
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,190
elite groups that confront each other

940
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,170
is not in any case at the soul of all this

941
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,040


942
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,330
no universities  necessity of my

943
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,880
times all because they did not know anything

944
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,250
for sure that training us or there are the

945
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,230
place where the research is done I no

946
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,600
longer deal with these things from here not

947
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:00,890
the crime myself since the crime, however, is the

948
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,380
taraf tour de france and  war

949
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,540
I am very happy I have undergone many people who

950
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,280
come from whose contexts it is the

951
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,990
best way to learn how to make

952
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,900
things end but I want to say one thing

953
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,030
I want to say here it will not break maccaroni

954
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,620
which, however, spaghetti agra and maccarone

955
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,210
then I do not cheer them that is they are

956
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,440
friends  that is to me you are friends but there is

957
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,090
a because I see it as a risk not

958
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,520
immediately because it is the name immediately and the way

959
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,770
I repeat it is the best form to do

960
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,870
the research is by far the best

961
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,160
way  iore to learn these things without

962
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,190
risking the songs years but I see a

963
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:39,050
risk because at least in the professional sphere then

964
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,990
I wrote it let's not

965
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,090
confuse masturbation not in the hand

966
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,000
this which does not want to be an invitation to

967
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,830
clouds semine a hospital ctf and does not

968
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,780
want to be a  invitation to crime but

969
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,220
also appears professionally then

970
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,810
this type of profession when she was

971
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,810
kidnapped there are no you have to find them

972
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,440
so different but I repeat ctf will also have to

973
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,390
organize a short one but it is not a

974
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,020
criticism and it is a broader message to

975
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,970
beautiful it is conceivable the governments of the

976
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,620
security conference that we are doing

977
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,720
you are the hope of the scene you

978
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,630
rome

979
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,190
to whoever was there who are

980
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,849
still maintain the genuine spirit of

981
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:19,539
certain things

982
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:21,309
yet if in the mainstream because now

983
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:25,119
this is therefore to avoid precisely today

984
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,400
or you work or pass off as carmen

985
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,660
there is no middle ground

986
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,460
in this sector peaks in skill and

987
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,559
to do follows me leaves only this was

988
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,390
and that's it but they don't arrive n  Even

989
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,069
so individuals, however, I don't already know that they

990
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,450
are not individuals they are not a

991
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,700
species

992
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,440
everyone chooses for themselves each one chooses in

993
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,029
this graph where to put themselves so

994
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:48,190
jenny there are many at certain

995
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,720
times they change there were around there are

996
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,160
those who make tools  those who

997
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,440
use them the tools knowledge

998
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,759
and information city radiation seems to

999
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:56,230
have gone

1000
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,539
through this type of crimes the

1001
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,569
layers and independent people from the

1002
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:02,680
simple 06 two steps towards

1003
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,150
state intelligence in the

1004
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,440
road map what is

1005
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,809
crime version over simply the  work

1006
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:10,210
so we are not hackers are not a

1007
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,799
species they are individuals and therefore

1008
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,960
as individuals they decide what to do

1009
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,240
is once it was a pastime

1010
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,279
razzante line means that we thought they

1011
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:23,130
study I finished the time

1012
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,840
I am attaching the world

1013
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,239
[Applause]

1014
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,030
I just wanted to say that in the faq  del

1015
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,750
berghem pasted recovered links

1016
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,560
of leeds in dell 87 of dt and 222 for

1017
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:06,620
guitars he knows he looked leprosy motifs

1018
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,620
of indie music gaza no i'm kidding

1019
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,680
it is a question that maybe you

1020
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,450
can take away words point a

1021
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,130
comment on this testament is

1022
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,250
shown

1023
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,030
are two elements one that

1024
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,650
rightly show them and it was impressive

1025
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,050
because we never do pixar all the

1026
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,170
realities  that in one way or another they

1027
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,470
got off they took to log in and

1028
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,840
they are not even network they are not all on

1029
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,060
foot but it is only because it is an explosion

1030
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,280
of it was an explosion of beautiful things and it is

1031
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,580
very beautiful and for and rightly said

1032
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,700
that in what measure the cfd now the

1033
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,850
tv groups are now a bit if you want

1034
00:43:54,850 --> 00:44:00,080
a replacement but a modern version of

1035
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,460
that exact counter that they were

1036
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,890
here in my opinion you are right in saying that

1037
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:12,770
the ctf obviously are not the brands

1038
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,650
I think between  the other was very

1039
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,300
beautiful memories

1040
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,910
I think from the point of view of the

1041
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,720
education of the didactics but also

1042
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,970
being socially playing that role

1043
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,970
there being a counter is for us I am and

1044
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,830
I am happy that  this thing

1045
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,810
the university is doing this is a

1046
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,720
fundamental thing but also by itself because it

1047
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,970
's okay the university that had taken care of

1048
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,380
this

1049
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,480
is not that the macaroni were

1050
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,640
supported when they were overcome

1051
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,589
perhaps by stefano zanero every

1052
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:48,380
mass band that every  we were late we came a bit of

1053
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:53,210
sex yes that will arrange

1054
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:53,640
the operation

1055
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:00,549
[Applause]

1056
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:03,500
I have a question that could be

1057
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,230
stupid and I do not come from this

1058
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,269
generation of hackers even from the one

1059
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:11,390
after maybe it is the one after still there have

1060
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,839
been handed down some songs that

1061
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:19,750
narrate the  the potre of these old ones

1062
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,769
like my band or a tot

1063
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:28,130
who is who made them because I would like to

1064
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,940
offer you a beer even two

1065
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:38,240
and then I signed on Monday but heaven in

1066
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,740
a city with him

1067
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:45,890
if you want to say if he wants but it is on end

1068
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:52,059
though  I'm already at work abroad

1069
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:57,640
yes yes good of the boy

1070
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:12,769
[Applause]
