1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
thank you thank you good morning good

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,570
morning everyone is a

3
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,430
very unfortunate position in the agenda because

4
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,900
obviously I am your starter

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,390
so eat pure questions at the

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,610
end of the talk I hope to maybe be able to

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,460
steal a few minutes

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,870
in reality the title is cryptic mind I

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,850
will not talk about hardware  security I

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,949
will not talk about radio security I will try

11
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:55,330
to teach you what I learned

12
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,559
by doing my first

13
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,500
security analysis of a radio system because

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,250
I believe it is an area where it is difficult to

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,650
take the first step for me it was very

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,720
difficult to take the first step  because

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,140
until a year ago I only

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,640
dealt with the firmware level just above

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,960
the firmware level so I have always

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,200
been very high in the

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,930
technological stack level but what I have

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,510
learned I believe that the fact that I

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,190
am explaining it to you as if you want also a

24
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,470
neophyte  of this matter because I've been

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,840
working on it for a year I don't even think it

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,270
can give everyone an opportunity to

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,840
say m  a with what we see today

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,550
tonight maybe I go home tomorrow I go

29
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,000
home I try to take the first step because

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,890
an area where as we saw

31
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,980
this morning with denis el hardware the new

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,580
software so there is an

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,190
immensity of work to be done in the hardware  and there

34
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,150
will be more and more like all

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,720
conferences that are clearly respected

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,610
the final event is fundamental

37
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,560
so we too will have a final event

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,310


39
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,010
and it is precisely at a final event of

40
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,979
a conference where I was together

41
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,970
with Mr. Balducci in May where I

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,590
found  the occasion for this talk

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,640
actually an excuse and

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,780
this is a photo we took

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,940
in the evening in a club in amsterdam

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,260
and here we got the idea of actually the

47
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,000
true story that we were a bit bored and

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,430
so we said but we find

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,040
something  to do because around one

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
o'clock there was a general stampede because

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,160
food and alcohol started to run out

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,630
so we were still

53
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,250
there and he said we have to find

54
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,730
something to do p  er killing time

55
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,280
yes in fact amsterdam is generally a

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,070
very boring city so the subject

57
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,020
of my presentation this

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,480
bracelet is one of those bracelets

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,120
that are given for example concerts

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,170
to events that are synchronized with

61
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,190
the lighting system I piloted by the disc

62
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,550
jockey all  in the games or sometimes

63
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,650
even piloted by hand there are actually I

64
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,060
discovered that there is a

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,970
fairly complex technology behind there are

66
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,760
also industrial standards and

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,049
therefore everything I did not know

68
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,640
at the beginning I discovered it along the way

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,200
are actually used  even

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,510
for performances of a certain importance

71
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,709
so events that are watched by

72
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,880
hundreds of thousands of people also

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,160
broadcast on television are the same

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,340
systems that are used to

75
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,329
synchronize the lights in theaters so

76
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,709
even if for once we are able to make

77
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,360
a safety law where  no one

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,220
dies crushed by a load coming

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,019
down from a crane or the

80
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,930
robotic arm of a mad robot

81
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,579
I would say that the impact of any of a

82
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,380
security bug found in such a

83
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,820
system can at least

84
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,540
damage the image

85
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,519
if you imagine a show like this is

86
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,470
watched by hundreds of people and

87
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,690
maybe even the performers rely on the

88
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,579
fact that the lights must  how to say

89
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,280
rhythm something the interesting thing about

90
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,770
these devices is that they are small they

91
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,669
are cheap but they are also very

92
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,510
similar electronically to a small

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,150
device

94
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,880
help because inside them they have a

95
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,000
microcontroller we see this

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,040
pointer that was advertised to me

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,360
as also nice a microcontroller that

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,670
in fact  it is the one that executes the code

99
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,610
from application logic and then a radio

100
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,000
for this I do and the antenna this here

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
is the radio

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,760
then there is an output peripheral in

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,160
this case it is a led that flashes it

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,110
went to other systems could

105
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,850
be relays  of the other actuators of the

106
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,630
other devices that do something

107
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,920
so I think they are

108
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,290
perfect devices to start because  é they are

109
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,380
cheap small they cost nothing they

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,250
are perfect so today we will take a

111
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,440
lesson to start from scratch so those who

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,300
have never looked at such a device

113
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,220
even before even less even for less

114
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,080
more complex do not worry because

115
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,550
today we start from scratch

116
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,660
and we get to do a reverse

117
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,310
complete engineering of these

118
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,830
hill devices I promise that with

119
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,760
what you bring home you will

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,560
be able to do an analysis

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,210
of even more

122
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,250
complex devices.Here, for example, it is an

123
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,690
industrial radio control system for automation

124
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,000
so let's start with ours from our

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,620
party at a certain  point my colleague

126
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,500
sends me a photo with what you see here

127
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,660
that has the whole face of being the

128
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,850
transmitter there was in fact an antenna

129
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,120
of about thirty centimeters and already from

130
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,130
here that a fairly simple photo

131
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,860
we have elements to start

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,080
our investigation  who has already done

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,390
black box analysis of this kind knows that these

134
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,470
elements are neither ex nor taken for granted but

135
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,090
often they are  the only ones we start with,

136
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,980
that is, you have a box, read

137
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,140
the frequency to the maximum and then we see that

138
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,000
there are also two numbers 095 0 0 4 that

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,890
we do not know what they are but it is

140
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,080
important to have these elements in mind

141
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,370
because maybe during the analysis

142
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,710
they could be useful and then we see the

143
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,810
name of the vendor by going to look

144
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,490
we see that although it is a

145
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,670
fairly small and local vendor because it was

146
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,180
in the netherlands it has quite

147
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,750
important customers so we have an idea of the

148
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,930
kind of the caliber of an impact

149
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,970
of a  security bugs that

150
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,500
we can eventually find

151
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,450
after which if we look well we

152
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,460
also discover that in reality there is a whole

153
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,550
technology that is standard in the system

154
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,130
of lighting control systems but

155
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:05,000
this is a contour matter so

156
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,470
let's start by opening our

157
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,000
device this is  only a

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,190
receiver is the first thing we

159
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,860
ask ourselves is what the hell is this thing

160
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,870
what are these components so

161
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,210
first of all we have to  identify the

162
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,450
components we have in front of us

163
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,800
here a little trick you don't need

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,290
big equipment you don't need a

165
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,200
microscope you just need the camera

166
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,850
of your mobile phone which is powerful enough

167
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,620


168
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,210
so if you want to frame the device

169
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,430
that is a real photo taken during

170
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,490
the analysis you do not see anything  in the case

171
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,490
we say in this way but only by

172
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,290
zooming and holding the phone still

173
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,090
you can see

174
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,820
the numbers substantially very well if you then illuminate them with

175
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,880
a tangential light

176
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,050
some of these numbers are not

177
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,030
only printed they are also slightly

178
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,670
silk-screened so shadows are created

179
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,680
that allow you  to see the numbers very well

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,720
note that this you see at the

181
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,900
bottom left is 4 mm x 4 mm so

182
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,790
quite small naked eye it is

183
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,530
very difficult to see it you get the abbreviations

184
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,050
we know what type of devices

185
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,730
we have but we want to know more how

186
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,020
what work  are that features

187
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,570
then have a bit of google and you can find the

188
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,780
data sheet id  ata there are very

189
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,050
important if you do not find them I have

190
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,020
a device in which I do not know

191
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,620
because honestly it was not possible with

192
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,669
the codes that were there probably

193
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,340
because they are confidential to trace back to some

194
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,080
public information it is the first time

195
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,570
that this happened to me so if not there  it is the

196
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,270
data if there is no datasheet it is very

197
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,220
difficult to make such an analysis

198
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,480
because you are totally in the dark

199
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:54,410
who is a radio amateur knows that even just

200
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,509
looking at this device knows that it

201
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,429
is a digital radio for those who are

202
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,989
not radio amateurs for those who are not  an

203
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,899
electronic expert take a look at the date it is

204
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,579
clear that what we

205
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,860
are looking at is a device that gives

206
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,670
a digital signal and transports it in

207
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,199
analogue in the air because

208
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,639
fortunately it is not possible to

209
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,019
transmit digital signals directly

210
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,549
into the air so it means that

211
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:20,749
from some  part for example in the

212
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,850
microcontroller there will be a code that

213
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,769
wants between when it wants to transmit a

214
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,029
series of zeros joined the radio our  or

215
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,619
radio device will do what is

216
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,559
called a modulation operation that is, it will

217
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,100
convert our alphabet

218
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,079
which in this case is a binary alphabet

219
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,259
into characteristics of the wave to be

220
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,420
transmitted in this case the

221
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,100
characteristics of the wave to be transmitted

222
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,860
are for example frequency  high frequency

223
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,989
low frequency high frequency low and

224
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,869
in this way you have encoded the

225
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:57,309
symbols you want to transmit

226
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,009
on the other side, i.e. in the receiver which

227
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,019
is the bracelet we have in our hand,

228
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,420
the reverse operation is performed, i.e. a de

229
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,559
modulator which receives the signal from the antenna

230
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,629
analogue does the

231
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:15,559
reverse operation that establishes classifications of the

232
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,779
characteristics of the wave it is

233
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,309
analyzing of the signal it is

234
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:20,990
analyzing to decide if what it

235
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,470
has read is an 11 0 and from here then you can

236
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,629
obviously complicate as much as you want and

237
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,089
transmit as many symbols as you

238
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,860
it seems

239
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,689
and in the end then in the face of a received signal it

240
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,699
will decide what to do for example

241
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,410
in our case turn on a  led but it

242
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,819
could be open close a

243
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:44,059
switch agree so from a

244
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,519
point of view blacks black box

245
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,929


246
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,970
closed box we are very interested in knowing how to

247
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,399
decode this transmission

248
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,549
notice that we are not talking about

249
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,929
standard protocols in this case

250
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,490
we are talking about bluetooth

251
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,199
we are not talking  of bluetooth zigbee

252
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:02,509
thing of this kind we are talking about

253
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,220
proprietary protocols

254
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,230
so what we do is a

255
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,360
complete analysis of a signal that

256
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,540
we have probably never seen if it had been

257
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,399
bluetooth we would have needed a dongle

258
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:20,059
to redo the communication unfortunately

259
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,039
also in the industrial field they continue

260
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,309
to  there are many protocols that are

261
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,369
completely opaque non-standard security

262
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,240
threats flourished or no security in rome

263
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,829
so then what we want to do is

264
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,299
since we only have access

265
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,959
to the analog signal is the ability to

266
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,240
sample the signal

267
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,259
quickly enough so that we can reconstruct the

268
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,269
signal  analog starting  from a series

269
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:49,129
of samples what you see in red

270
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,929
are the samples

271
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,339
basically you sample

272
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,319
the signal intensity at a certain

273
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:57,320
speed to

274
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,030
do this there are tools that

275
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,810
if you want are like sound cards

276
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,430
only that instead of having the microphone they have

277
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,340
a  'antenna very different but the

278
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,400
logic is that instead of

279
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,620
sampling the intensity of the sound vibration

280
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,250


281
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,500
the sample the intensity of the signal that

282
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,120
arrives at the antenna quite

283
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,580
quickly even up to over ten

284
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,790
twenty thirty negates samples per second and

285
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,610
therefore what you have is  a signal

286
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,170
made as you can see on the right this

287
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,180
series of dots that you can then clearly manipulate in the

288
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,970
software interpolate and

289
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,560
you can do all the analyzes you want

290
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,200
in the meantime it was about 2 am so it

291
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,690
was a three-quarter of an hour past the food was

292
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,790
scarce as you can see people are

293
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,950


294
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,350
according to you, a group of nerds at a

295
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,690
party at the end of a conference

296
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,000
with a device like that in  hand according to

297
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,510
you what do you do half an hour's

298
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,430
walk to get to the hotel take

299
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,980
the backpack go back take the

300
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,840
acquisition card and start to

301
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,880
acquire the signal while the DJ was

302
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:13,550
broadcasting as you can see there was almost

303
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,150
nobody

304
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,730
this  gloomy shows the last three

305
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,680
who were really having the last

306
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,260
drink was us

307
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,060
and obviously the dj at some point

308
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,520
started to take an interest in work and

309
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,990
came there to see what the hell

310
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,540
we were doing with antennas in

311
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,950
an amsterdam nightclub rightly

312
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,650
stefano stefano just points out that

313
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,720
amsterdam is an extremely

314
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,410
boring city but very tolerant to hello I didn't see you

315
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,610
so we only know roughly

316
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,360
the 869 mega hertz frequency

317
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,640
so we tune our

318
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,610
antenna and pull a bit randomly for the

319
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,580
band we want to capture be sure

320
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,140
that to capture all the signal without

321
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,270
losing anything so we abound a

322
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,150
little the card we used was

323
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,670
a blader f so  but enough bandwidth

324
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,730
you can sample at 10 my cards at 10

325
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,240
seconds so it is quite fast

326
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,829
the important thing for which in this

327
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,050
case the dj helped us and have a

328
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,199
lot of cases that is if for example a

329
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,050
remote control that transmits via radio

330
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,269
what you want to do is  while capturing

331
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,209
make you many files each in the conditions

332
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,639
in all conditions so when the

333
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,410
led flashed blue we made

334
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,480
another file when the led flashed red

335
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,029
we made another file then a

336
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,860
different file take note of all the

337
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,779
acquisition conditions if you want you

338
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,910
could also automate think if

339
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,639
you have  a device with 100 buttons to

340
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,440
attach relays you click them

341
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,260
one at a time and acquire a signal

342
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,510
each time then try to use up

343
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,430
the

344
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,320
search space as much as possible have as much

345
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,290
metadata as possible then done this

346
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,320
the first test of the very

347
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,560
trivial monkey that  one can do is once

348
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,540
the signal is captured a bit as if we

349
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,910
had no regis  I heard a voice from

350
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,910
someone who tells us something if you want to

351
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,440
try to deceive whoever is on

352
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,420
the other side of the phone to see if they

353
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,250
recognize you as you or a voice

354
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,290
recorded here too we can do the

355
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,060
same thing we

356
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,980
reproduce with the

357
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,440
transmission antennas  the signal recorded and

358
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,170
let's see what happens

359
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,380
now if it happens that our

360
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,260
bracelet turns on and off

361
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,610
it is not a problem because it is a

362
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,470
quite harmless device

363
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,949


364
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:48,380
the agreement therefore that there is no

365
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,730
safety design behind this

366
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,649
protocol can also be

367
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,930
we talked to the vendor the vendor

368
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,190
probably did not answer us out of

369
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,819
politeness but it is clear that such a vendor

370
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,149
ignores such a thing

371
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,949
on the subject of reputation still

372
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:05,899
I am not convinced that it should be

373
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,910
ignored but let's say that if

374
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,500
you have followed our work

375
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,720
in the  last period and you discover that

376
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,600
similar attacks as simple as a

377
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,940
reply attack can be made on

378
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,760
devices  i like these here then the

379
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,829
problem is a little bigger because it

380
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:23,390
means that you have

381
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,290


382
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,889
material automation protocols that control maybe a

383
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,130
crane a port logistics system and

384
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,389
anything else that anyone who gets there with

385
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:39,190
a tape recorder a radio software

386
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,470
record plaie the  device goes back

387
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,660
to the same movement it did before

388
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,139
and it is an extremely trivial attack

389
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:52,819
so much so that speaking with one of the vendors

390
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:55,790
of these devices who also sits at

391
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,670
one of the standardization tables that

392
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,620
maintains the physical security standards

393
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,290
of these devices,

394
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,609
he told us that  after reading

395
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,609
our work on industrial controls

396
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,829
he tried to bring to the attention

397
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,280
of those who maintain the standard

398
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,990
the inclusion of a requirement that

399
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,709
said that the minimum that is required is

400
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,240
that such a trivial attack is not

401
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,569
possible in an industrial device.

402
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,010
minimum that is required does not

403
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,419
require that you use great

404
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,970
sophistication encryption authentication

405
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,250
and so on  but at least an anti replay

406
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,850
atac so let's go back to our signal

407
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,960
we had captured a

408
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
completely analog signal

409
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,919
now we have to modulate it to understand

410
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,679
what digital represents

411
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,450
now there are many ways to modulate

412
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,130
a signal to modulate a

413
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,049
signal you can change its  amplitude to

414
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,580
represent zeros and ones you can

415
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,470
change the frequency to represent

416
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,340
different symbols

417
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,380
you can change in the phase there are

418
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,590
many luckily the

419
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,049
search space is finished so with the datasheet

420
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,090
in hand a bit of experience

421
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,340
can you guess what the pattern of

422
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,230
modulation thanks to tools such as in

423
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,299
this case universe honecker areas

424
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,040
but in general all the software stack

425
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,850
that is above developed by

426
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,500
the open source community and in this area it

427
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,679
is now much more accessible to do

428
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,750
this kind of analysis which up to

429
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,490
a few years ago it required some

430
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,070
software development over while with

431
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,990
software like univ  erse and radio hecker

432
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,880
you can for example choose which is the

433
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,530
demo of the action you want to try in

434
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,309
this case

435
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,649
frequency shift and volumes shows

436
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,289
exactly the signal and is modulated ok

437
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,399
we are getting there

438
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,600
now here what you see are the

439
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,120
modulated packets the threshold  between

440
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,149
purple and light green and the threshold between the

441
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:53,029
0 symbol the one symbol if you zoom in

442
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,230
on one of these packages for a moment you

443
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,519
start to see something

444
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,019
interesting there is something that looks

445
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,190
like zeros of ones obviously

446
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,720
we have to adjust the threshold for a moment

447
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,820
because  so it is all one is above the

448
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,799
threshold of 1

449
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,299
so we choose what the decision threshold is

450
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:10,159
and we start to see

451
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,169
something interesting below that is we

452
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,720
actually see a modulation of the

453
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,340
signal in al faber in perfect symbols

454
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,289
now it is interesting what we have

455
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,480
seen here because if you  open the

456
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,789
datasheet and look you find that

457
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,409
the package structure at least the

458
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,960
known one, not the standard one, sorry the

459
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,309
one decided  from the manufacturer contains a

460
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,529
preamble in this kind of protocols

461
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:39,409
a preamble is obviously necessary

462
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,999
because it is necessary to tell another

463
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,490
receiver when a packet is starting

464
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,809
when a packet is about to arrive it

465
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,779
serves to wake up the radio

466
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,879
of the receiver and above all to give it

467
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,580
a time reference to understand

468
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,429
another  very important parameter so

469
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,230
here we have seen that it is probably a

470
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,269
preamble second important parameter

471
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,610
so preamble is useful to understand

472
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,909
how long 110 is

473
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,429
remember that we are starting from here

474
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,619
that thing there at the bottom right there is a

475
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,509
set of points

476
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:14,690
how many of these  points make a 1 as many as

477
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,330
you need ok you need to know this

478
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,799
because otherwise if you make the window

479
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,960
too wide too narrow it is wrong to

480
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,690
interpret to do this it is

481
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,580
necessary to select in this case

482
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,759
the amplitude of one of these plateaus of

483
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,190
these peaks and the one as you see here

484
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,740
in  left bottom left half 10

485
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,899
and the number of dots you for  hand a

486
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:40,669
symbol we set 10 as the width of

487
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:41,990
our window we start to see

488
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,490
something interesting all the

489
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,740
packets are almost the same they have a

490
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,130
fairly regular structure except one

491
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,750
which is actually the only one that has been

492
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,970
decoded correctly the others

493
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,230
are wrongly qualified

494
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,800
now  we come to understand why

495
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,970
someone will surely have noticed that the

496
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,860
preamble was not perfect there was a

497
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,370
double 1 in front there was not 10 10 10

498
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,210
start with 11 if in fact we look at the

499
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,890
signal and it is important to keep

500
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,850
going back and forth to look at signal

501
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,740
symbols signal symbols  note that the

502
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,080
first peak of the preamble is a little

503
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,860
wider than the others this is actually an

504
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,950
error in reception an error in the

505
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,020
transmitter we were too close

506
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,300
there was too much noise it can happen that there

507
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,090
are errors during reception

508
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,520
during transmission it is therefore

509
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,060
necessary  removing these errors now

510
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,400
universal radio necker makes this trivial

511
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,110
in the sense that b  auction really

512
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,090
select the piece you want to

513
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,850
delete press kick and it cancels and

514
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,520
you have shortened symbol otherwise you

515
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,850
clearly do it in post set

516
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,590
analysis let's say you have yours

517
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,590
your preamble every time you see

518
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,940
110 101 at the beginning of a pack

519
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,500
you know that the first one is  you have to

520
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,780
eliminate universal and honecker

521
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,930
allows you to do this even

522
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,010
within the software without having to

523
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,190
export and import very well

524
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,770
now let's go back to our datasheet

525
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,690
where we have more information on what

526
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,210
is after the preamble there is a

527
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,150
word called sync ward  which actually helps

528
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,910
the receiver to understand if that message

529
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,250
is a sort of address for him, then

530
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,050
there may be a length that indicates

531
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,030
how long the payload that comes after is long

532
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,830
and then another address that can be

533
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,600
useful for disambiguing packets and

534
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,430
maybe creating  networks of devices now

535
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,550
here we go from the binary to 16

536
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,460
but we look at the packets with the fields

537
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,620
highlighted in yellow i  The preamble in

538
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,890
green la the synchronization word and

539
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,620
then there is a red field which

540
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,630
is probably the address if we follow a

541
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,000
suggested structure and then the blue part which for now

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,820
is a payload unknown to us now the

543
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,620
interesting thing is that you already have

544
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
I noticed maybe I have highlighted it

545
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:09,080
95 0x 950 ic 95 comes from what we

546
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,750
had seen on the

547
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,030
transmitter labels so it is something that

548
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,060
probably has to do with the address to

549
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,560
which that transmitter is transmitting

550
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,140
maybe it is possible to create four networks 5

551
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,690
networks  of bracelets maybe

552
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,110
flashing in different colors

553
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,180
after which if we look at further

554
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,220
confirmations and look at that in

555
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,360
correspondence of the address 90 0 95

556
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,450
there is a double f in the third byte of

557
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,940
the payload will be the color

558
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,750
ok in rgb the colors are represented with

559
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,730
three bytes l  'intensity of red

560
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,320
the intensity of green the intensity of

561
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,900
blue by varying these values you can

562
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,130
create patterns of different colors

563
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,250
the LEDs this sorry to confirm we had

564
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,770
the signal is actually captured

565
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,510
when when the led flashed

566
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,050
blue

567
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,970
for this reason it is important to know that you have

568
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,760
noted what the signal

569
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,310
you have captured referred to because otherwise you will

570
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,490
find that there is ff in the third column

571
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,770
of the payload but you do not know what it

572
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,430
refers to  this view I

573
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,830
forgot to mention it is a

574
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,180
view that

575
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,620
automatically highlights the differences between

576
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,380
packages in red you see the differences

577
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,960
with the previous package then one is an

578
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,930
automatic ping that can be

579
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,490
enabled within tools like

580
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,320
this or with a

581
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,240
truly trivial excel sheet  the and there were two

582
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,830
so there are two columns one real

583
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,020
hidden for simplicity are two columns

584
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:55,820
that indicate two colors finished now

585
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,050
if you want 1

586
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,880
must start rebuilding a

587
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,690
transmitter we want to see the LEDs

588
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,280
flashing at the color we want

589
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,870
not to understand if we have actually

590
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,390
made the  things done well

591
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,390
we have two ways or we use what

592
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,600
ab  we have

593
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,130
the information we have collected

594
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,260
so far but they are quite

595
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,270
inaccurate we know roughly the

596
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,190
frequency we know the preamble the sim

597
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,410
card etc. we know roughly the

598
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,150
band is quite

599
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,730
inaccurate information and when you design a

600
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,950
transmitter it is essential to be

601
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,580
very very accurate if you

602
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,280
really want the same performance  of the

603
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,090
original transmitter so we would like to

604
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,360
know how the microcontroller or

605
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,490
rather the firmware that runs inside the

606
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,450
microcontroller has configured the radio

607
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,850
or said on the radio tuned

608
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,050
to 8 89 68 69 myers with this band with

609
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,250
this preamble etcetera etcetera

610
00:25:59,250 --> 00:25:59,820
etc

611
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,850
these two talk to a  protocol

612
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,180
which is called spy or referred to the

613
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,210
interface which is standard and which passes

614
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,950
on these four children that is a clock

615
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,440
there is an there is an input there is an output and there is

616
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,340
a signal comes ball

617
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,430
now we would like to be able  look on

618
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,440
these wires and do the same

619
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,300
operation we did with the prim radio

620
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,030
that is, to sample the signal which in this

621
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,030
case is digital and to be able to reconstruct the

622
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,740
messages that these two are

623
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,230
exchanging to do this, there are

624
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,140
instruments similar to a sort of

625
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,870
radio finder which however work on the

626
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,630
wires are called logic analyzer and

627
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,850
allow you to do exactly this  you

628
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,800
connect with crocodiles as you can see

629
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,080
at the top right this is not the device in

630
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,180
question but it is another

631
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,770
another microcontroller you connect

632
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,080
with crocodiles and he samples at

633
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,160
a certain frequency

634
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,440
the intensity of his voltage

635
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,720
seen on these wires  compared to a

636
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,520
land they sell on amazon from 6 euros

637
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,770
that are great for

638
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,600
small projects like these there are

639
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,980
professional logic analyzer that can

640
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,650
cost even several hundred euros

641
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,850
even over thousands and here there is a

642
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:24,640
practical problem and 4 mm and  ping I'm a

643
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,990
tenth hour or you have 50 euros per ping

644
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,790
available and if you don't want to, you

645
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,090
have to wait for them to arrive to buy you

646
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,160
a crocodile  so small that it can

647
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,810
cling there and I don't think it can

648
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,820
even cling because it is soldered in

649
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,780
smd so on the surface or

650
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,280
you have to find a way to hook

651
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,090
something to be able to sniff the pins

652
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,610
now the correct way is solder it now

653
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,380
solder it takes a moment to see

654
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,960
in the  its entirety the splendor of

655
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,080
this image weld and it is not trivial

656
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,540
but I recommend only one thing

657
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,740
if you want to do so gloves as

658
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,890
rightly suggests yvette asbestos

659
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,810
in short ok

660
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,110
jokes aside a practical suggestion

661
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,680
is that if you do not have

662
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,660
thin enough cables you do not need a

663
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,150
a lot take a usb cable and an

664
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,460
hdmi cable that you have around you open it and

665
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,410
inside there are single wires that are

666
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,540
also insulated which are also under the

667
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,700
tenth so I managed to hook me

668
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,820
quite well with tools that

669
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,150
cost nothing in this case my

670
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,880
suggestion is  put a tip of

671
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,100
tin on the wire

672
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,200
keep the wire hot with the soldering iron

673
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,660
rest remove the soldering iron  when you

674
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,370
leave the wire if you have worked well

675
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,280
the wire remains attached without doing

676
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,980
anything else without trying to work

677
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,640
tin wire on the pin on the board no it does not

678
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,770
work like this because it created a globe or a

679
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,530
huge tin

680
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,900
after which if you want to make the work

681
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,450
more relaxing you put a drop of

682
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,430
attack on it  and the wire no longer moves

683
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,529
very well

684
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,590
done this again datasheet in

685
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,720
hand datasheet in this case in this

686
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,700
case of the radio you need to know which

687
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,179
pines you have to attach to which are

688
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:35,070
labeled you attach yourself with your

689
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,500
logic analyzer and used in my

690
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,299
case I used yes  grock which is a

691
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,919
beautiful open source tool that can

692
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,860
be extended with thousands of plugins that

693
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,389
allows you

694
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,580
to reconstruct the

695
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,120
conversation from the sampled electrical signal the semantics of the spy ok

696
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,490
so it's a bit like with wireshark you

697
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,990
use a specific decoder

698
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,639
even here considered that it is possible to

699
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,639
reconstruct the semantics of the  spike and

700
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:04,980
here you see

701
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,759
everything very nice below, but the spy is only

702
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,129
one  of the layers the radio the

703
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:12,840
microcontroller they talk to each other another

704
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,789
application protocol above the spy

705
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:17,220
that we do not know and above all it is the

706
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,919
owner yes there are similarities

707
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,159
if you take all the radios in texas

708
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,340
of this family maybe they have more or

709
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,440
less the same protocol but every vendor

710
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,090
does  its above there so we have two

711
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,700
possibilities how to write a decoder

712
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,879
you starting from these bikes you see

713
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,340
below you subscribe a decoder with the

714
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,639
finished date in hand that I do not have at

715
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:48,840
the moment there is written for each

716
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,240
byte what an operation corresponds to and

717
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,009
so you subscribe the decoder and

718
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,980
reconstruct messages fortunately indeed

719
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,200
for us fortunately not so much because

720
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,820
it was published well after

721
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,559
we struggled a month to write

722
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,009
the decoder someone in the end

723
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:06,299
published some pious soul

724
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,429
published the insig rock integrated decoder

725
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,250
to decode the spy  of

726
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,600
the cc 11 01 family the cc 11 01 family is

727
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,500
the goal that includes is the includes both

728
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,120
part  receiver that the

729
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,200
transmitter part of our cc 11 3 l which is

730
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,940
what we have on the board which is

731
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,950
only a receiver so

732
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,409
that starting from the spy it is possible to

733
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,960
decode the higher

734
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,710
level messages in this case the

735
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,559
microcontroller is saying the laws on the radio

736
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,169
the status or read me what

737
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,450
's in the buffer and then see the answer

738
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,929
I remember you can also use

739
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:52,149
the command line interface which is

740
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:53,710
very convenient for automating

741
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,409
the acquisition you start this

742
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:59,200
this command you send them

743
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
pipe a file where  collect all the

744
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,799
information and you can stay there to

745
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,970
handle with the children connect and

746
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,130
disconnect the battery send

747
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,010
radio signals to get as many captures

748
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,269
as possible again very well now you

749
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,010
say we have arrived no we have not

750
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,220
arrived yet a piece is still missing because in

751
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,700
fact we have  reconstructed the values

752
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,500
of the registers at this point ie we

753
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,679
know when for example the

754
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,630
microcontroller says to r  adio set

755
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,700
this value in this register set

756
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,350
this value in this register and that's

757
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,090
fine but what these values mean

758
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,899


759
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:40,059
the radios in bad are not configured by

760
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:40,919
telling them

761
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,659
admit this frequency or admit

762
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,399
this band or to use this

763
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,370
preamble they are all configurations at the

764
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,350
level of  a bit at a time set

765
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,669
in the registers at most two

766
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,470
but they have a completely

767
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,200
defined semantics in a data sheet it is not a

768
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,100
human friendly semantics

769
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,860
so if there is no tool to

770
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,289
decode them automatically you have

771
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:07,690
to look at the data set tables

772
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,059
one at a time to understand what  it means

773
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:14,340
for example when register 0 b is

774
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,500
set with these bits at certain values it

775
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,090
is a job nor will you hardly

776
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,860
find tools that make even

777
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,100
programs break them this thing is

778
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,750
all inside the pdf some vendors

779
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,340
such as texas release

780
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,750
tools that allow you to  do

781
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,880
the reverse if you are

782
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,190
a programmer  of embedded systems and

783
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,230
you need to set the radio has

784
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,990
a certain frequency

785
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,059
you don't have to know by heart what

786
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,700
the set of registers and the values are to do

787
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,620
this you configure the

788
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,440
radio with the frequency or

789
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,090
band parameters or what you need is the

790
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,059
tool calculates the values of the

791
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,500
registers here we need to do the

792
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,809
reverse operation that is, from the registers to the

793
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,429
high-level semantics,

794
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,050
fortunately this tool also allows you

795
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,750
to do this there are inserted

796
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,940
in the right part which are the values

797
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,168
of the registers that we have acquired from

798
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,960
our acquisition  logic and he

799
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,250
automatically calculates the parameters

800
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,199
instead of the high level which are the ones

801
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,480
we had guessed so far we had

802
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,010
guessed how you can see the

803
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,909
frequency is not only 869 meyers

804
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,330
is much more there is much more

805
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,780
you know exactly what the number is for example

806
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,540
of symbols per second you know

807
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,190
what the receiver band is

808
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,379
you know what the modulation system

809
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,310
is that is not fsk mag  i fsk we thought it

810
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,609
was just fsk but it is the

811
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,129
gaussian version of fsk which is a little softer

812
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,350
in transitions maybe because of what

813
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,418
we had that initial spike for

814
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,480
which we used fsk etc etc

815
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,730
etc

816
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,690
so at this point we can

817
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,590
build our transmitter with

818
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,520
these  parameters

819
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,720
note that at the beginning we started

820
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,359
instead from guessing a lot

821
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,550
now we have two ways to build

822
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,950
our transmitter replica of the original one

823
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,520


824
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,490
the first is still using a sort

825
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,730
of radio file which however requires a bit of

826
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,630
work

827
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,869
the second is to use

828
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:32,130
these dong for example  in radiofrequency which are nothing more

829
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,050
than small

830
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,810
embedded systems with a radio a

831
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,520
microcontroller that are programmable

832
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,090
via python somehow I personally

833
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,720
don't like them

834
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,180
I'm not very

835
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,550
attracted to either of these two the

836
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,950
first because it actually requires a

837
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,770
bit of software work then  beyond the

838
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,359
programming work itself, the

839
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,960
amount of softw  are

840
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,060
the thickness of the software stack that there is

841
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,830
to send a package of seven might

842
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,190
in my opinion is disproportionate they are good

843
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,190
for much more complex jobs

844
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,380
the approach below instead is to use

845
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,200
pre-packaged dongles to the problem

846
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,480
that when you run into it  in a

847
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,150
radio in a particular radio that

848
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,400
has particular features that does not reach

849
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,980
the bandwidth you need or that

850
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,800
the modulation system was not born

851
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,280
you are screwed

852
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,580
because you cannot change the tuning chip that

853
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,440
is why I started

854
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,000
working on an instrument  that now

855
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,390
released completely open source

856
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,580
partially open hardware in the sense that

857
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,670
not all the schematics as

858
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,560
Andrea remembered were released not by me

859
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,480
but by the manufacturers of the bases not

860
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,000
all were released in

861
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,140
cai card format

862
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,869
but let's say that for inspiration and open

863
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:54,650
hardware and open software  the breadboard is

864
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,240
actually produced by adafruit which is a

865
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,880
manufacturer of aid devices such

866
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
as the divine  competing alone

867
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,589
does nothing but you can choose, for

868
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,750
example, to put yours in your

869
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,280
microcontroller in this case it is not

870
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,619
a classic xp 32

871
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,260
if you want you can put two radios

872
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,750
even different ones instead of a novecento one

873
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,560
tuned to 901 optimized a400m

874
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,580
gerz if you want to change radio  because not the

875
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,260
one you have does not support what

876
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,660
you need you can use another radio

877
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,400
you can change both

878
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,050
if you want another another

879
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,760
microcontroller for example latin sic is

880
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,839
very powerful

881
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,200
you can use team yes everything then

882
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,950
clearly also works on battery

883
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,839
so  you can carry it in a box

884
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,540
with you and have a flexible device,

885
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,240
I don't say as flexible as an ex br but

886
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,130
certainly more flexible than a

887
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,930
pre-packaged dongle

888
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,109
if you want to use special radios

889
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:58,020
you can produce the radar plate to

890
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,490
act as an adapter as we did

891
00:37:59,490 --> 00:37:59,970


892
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,760
or you can take the plate

893
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,530
proto as it is called in jargon and on

894
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,420
giving you over the radio that  you want as I

895
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,440
did in this case below

896
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,390
the software is completely open source

897
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,530
and allows you to have a simple clean ep ai

898
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,380
based on low grass to

899
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,720
talk to the radio talk to

900
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,360
microcontroller starting from

901
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,030
high-level operations such as receive sniff

902
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,250
filters  packets then a sort of

903
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,880
pax filtering that runs in the

904
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,170
microcontroller runs in the hardware that is

905
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,610
, packet filtering is not

906
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,900
done when you want to receive the packet

907
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,330
via software and then send back

908
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,340
information to miss you, for example, everything is done

909
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,930
in hardware but it is programmable

910
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,230
with an ep  to simple you can

911
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,210
retransmit packets on the fly after

912
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,100
modifying them you can add a

913
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,310
sort of firewall rules with also

914
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,960
some reaction policies for example

915
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,150
when I see this packet I change that

916
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,890
byte that other watt in this way then

917
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,570
immediately retransmitted with waves she

918
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,770
really small and  then it allows you to

919
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,480
access the registers even at low

920
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,110
level of your radio no  n I have

921
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,520
told you

922
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,090
excellent suggestion when you are

923
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,070
dealing with radio devices or in

924
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,900
any case aid devices that you want

925
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,780
to say about which you want to fiddle a

926
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,440
bit take two at least two even if they

927
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,860
cost a lot take two because one

928
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,340
surely ends up as bad as it

929
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,740
did  Wednesday

930
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,330
I was hoping that Marco had another

931
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,680
bracelet

932
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,660
I asked my colleague for one but then

933
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,250
I gave it back to him because he too wanted to

934
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,470
do his analysis and then asked

935
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,150
Marco if he had his device but he

936
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,310
told me he hadn't brought it

937
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,180
behind so I'm sorry I can not

938
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,109
leave you any demo

939
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,120
but however however however however however

940
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,830
however there are many on ebay

941
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,630
from here to Wednesday I didn't have

942
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,640
time to get them but you can go and

943
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,620
use requa so maybe you can also send me

944
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,930
some nice shoppers that

945
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,570
surely it is full of crap

946
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,030
so I would be very happy if you

947
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:30,300
would like to try it thank you very much

948
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,509
well if you have any questions we have some

949
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:43,459
raised mar  basically

950
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:54,789
bye bye I wanted to ask you

951
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:58,430
later when you found the

952
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,190
solution you presented to us you

953
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,200
also thought of a way to isolate the

954
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,410
other transmitters to have exclusive control

955
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,859
over the actuators

956
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:12,049
if you are close enough to the receivers and

957
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:15,170
if you are powerful enough you win when you are

958
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,339
not  there is authentication specific mechanisms

959
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:20,479


960
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,779
if you are the most powerful you win you might

961
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:26,779
want to keep busy for example

962
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:29,359
some receivers by always sending him

963
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,999
only preamble preamble preamble

964
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,650
preamble and he is there waiting for the

965
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,479
transmission so maybe even isolate

966
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:37,069
some receivers but isolate some

967
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:39,979
transmitters apart I would put in in

968
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,239
a bucket of water in a

969
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,450
faraday cage there is no other solution

970
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:52,868
please other questions

971
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,269
what

972
00:41:55,269 --> 00:42:01,289
there is a question here in the middle of the room I go

973
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:10,919
hand bye bye

974
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:13,359
then you have received further news from the

975
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,040
wind

976
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,590
no but in the meantime I have  found that the

977
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,700
standard that goes on the wire which is called

978
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:31,050
of mx 5 112 that because it can be

979
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,670
transported to  even via radio as in

980
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,780
this case it is a standard used in

981
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,170
even quite critical environments not

982
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,060
for industrial automation but for the

983
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,920
automation of very complex lighting systems

984
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,050
so if you go looking for

985
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,910
devices based on this standard you

986
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,850
can understand that maybe it is not  this is the

987
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,340
right vendor but there are other vendors

988
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,930
we obviously stumbled upon it by

989
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,880
pure chance I wanted to do this

990
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,060
because as daniels said in the morning

991
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,530
having fun is one of the fundamental things

992
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,820
we have also learned a lot

993
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,860
but we stumbled upon it completely by

994
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,500
chance wanting to choose them is

995
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,630
It is possible to find vendors who

996
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,280
really care about

997
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,580
any repercussions impacts of a

998
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,460
targeted attack on these devices to

999
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,880
get you on our job let's call it

1000
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,530
crane work which could actually

1001
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,030
not only be cranes but was all

1002
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,330
devices based on that type of

1003
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,980
communication  there was a lot of response

1004
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,390
from vendola what
