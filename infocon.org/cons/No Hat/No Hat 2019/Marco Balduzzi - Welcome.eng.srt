00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,560
thanks for being here so we had this

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,190
idea to create this event something like

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,440
maybe six months ago five month ago so

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,700
when I come up with say the everybody

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,860
was telling me okay dude are you crazy

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,990
we are going to set up another

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,150
conference in Bergen I mean we are not

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,280
in a room right we are not in Milan we

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,260
are invariable you are never conference

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,640
you will have your conference in English

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,970
in Italy where no one speak English that

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,510
good is going to to be a big failure but

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,480
you know I was pretty lucky so we create

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,130
a group of people actually they're part

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,590
of a local high club and the guys here

29
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,410

36

being here and believing in the event of

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,510
course when you get invited to a

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,540
conference and because race didn't exist

46
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,280
so you say okay do you know should I go

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,630

48
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,900
so thanks for you guys for being here of

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,700
course thanks to the sponsor the

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,770
conference at which this year is free

51
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,220
entrance so and virome cost a lot so

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,720
without those promise would have been

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,230
impossible so take a time to go out talk

54
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,260
with your sponsor and we also have some

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,900
job openings

56
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,050
better least adjust out of it all so if

57
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,640
you're looking for a job I'm a security

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,120
domain take a look at the Pakeha so just

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,310
outside of a door

60
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,830
so because would be why no help so we

61
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,630
came up with this name if I begin

62
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,970
because was kind of cool but then we

63
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,709
realize okay probably you know there

64
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,269
should be a meaning behind why it's

65
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:43,190
called no hat so most of you know what

66
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,900
could be like a white hat so when you

67
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
think a white hat you think at the

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,790
office to you the typical student from

69
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,819
computer science like very clever veil

70
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,510
intelligence that you know won't really

71
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,900
get into the security industry and what

72
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,510
happened most of the time is that you

73
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,580
have like this very smart very clever

74
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,099
person that get hired by companies or

75
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,530
agency that you'd say okay you know like

76
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,840
if you take a government National Agency

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,330
it could be for example NSA you might

78
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,280
say okay they know is is run by the

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,989
government so it should be like a gteen

80
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,930
entity so you have these people working

81
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,420
there but to sort understand the my for

82
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,390
example go into the direction where am I

83
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,090
for example being asked to look for zero

84
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,100
days look for new vulnerabilities and

85
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,470
maybe varietals to tool for several

86
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,739
civilians and espionage so the question

87
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,049
will be okay do you know so easily GT

88
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,750
morgan ization giving them a job very

89
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,109
regularly paid to different extension

90
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,630
but advanced it over you know they look

91
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,060
for vulnerabilities a new coder in a

92
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,430
published code in property code they

93
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,440
myself vulnerable 80222 in our state so

94
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,880
they're all it's questionable whatever

95
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,739
which is really what we believe is white

96
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:06,859
at so is it green white or not on the

97
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,660
other side of the fence very easy of

98
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,280
course the black hat you know when you

99
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,750
think a black cat you think a typical

100
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,920
deal could be like Eastern Europe are

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,579
criminals that I don't know like

102
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,510
installer and somewhere on computer to

103
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,390
transfer man as primary or based on a

104
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,970
Trojan on your mobile phone

105
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,150
to steal your bank credential on the

106
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,290
other side you might have for example

107
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,750
what could be like a black hat but

108
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,710
actually is just a just a kid that it

109
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,540
might be for example an activist that

110
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,770
he's against for example the illegal

111
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,170
massive phishing of two ninety minute

112
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,290
Iranian see you know that you know there

113
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,640
are not many fishes around especially

114
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,590
tuna baby didn't see because Japanese

115
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,080
for example are fishing a lot so on the

116
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,240
Japanese market if you go to Tokyo and

117
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,920
you go up at you wake up at 3 a.m. in

118
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,570
the morning you can visit the fish

119
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,610
market where are this big tuna better so

120
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,830
the fish market so you might have people

121
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,800
that are against this massive and abuse

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,650
of fishing currency every point you

123
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,290
could have like with kids but you know

124
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,910
is having his beer looking for

125
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,030
vulnerabilities in the in the webpage of

126
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,000
one of these fishing company and maybe

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,010
hacking the homepage doing what's called

128
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,200
the face man so replacing the homepage

129
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,230
with a mess in say for protesting you

130
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,550
know for saying you know we we don't

131
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,280
agree with this so if it's really a

132
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,060
blackhead

133
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,410
I don't know right so what is the border

134
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,240
between what is white and what is black

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,370
so if you and this came up like you say

136
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,990
doesn't matter do you know which kind of

137
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,810
hat you have it doesn't matter so we

138
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,870
tend to put the people in boxes like I'm

139
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,940
a certified ethical hacker because I ran

140
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,950
B certification okay dude so you're

141
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,620
certified okay so you have your label

142
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,780
owned by the VN is just a label so we

143
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,580
believe what is important is to learn

144
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,040
become expert have been passionate what

145
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,260
you do and you follow your own ethics at

146
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,000
the end we all have an ethics like as

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,060
professional or as the person so you

148
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,650
have to share you have your own ATS and

149
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,090
you have to share your belief with the

150
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,240
others and this is what really matter so

151
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,210
let me give a bit of a summary of what

152
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,010
we have on the plate today so what about

153
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,620
our menu so we start in the morning with

154
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,490
a session that are a bit more technical

155
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,630
compared with what may have

156
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,720
investor-owned so the morning we have

157
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,140
Daniel opening with the first keynote is

158
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,699
giving a session on

159
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,479
mark micro architectural attacks so this

160
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,979
Dooley found a lot of very cool

161
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,419
vulnerabilities related to our

162
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:48,469
professional works

163
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:51,139
so it's talking about harbor security if

164
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,599
you want and these goes as much in line

165
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,969
with what Andrea will be following up

166
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,490
