1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,879
all right

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
good i think it's time to start i mean

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,719
people are still waking up

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,599
uh some other people probably are almost

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,519
done with lunch time so it's more like

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,400
uh

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
we are chilling out uh at all their

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,600
couch

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,439
watching for us so it's a pleasure for

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,720
you to be here

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
uh so let me start by say thank you

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
uh thanks to the community thanks to

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
everybody who participated in this

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,160
uh for us this kind of experiment um

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
so we started no hat like last year uh

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
so last year was already a big

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,320
experiment first time

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,600
uh we went uh live with this event and

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
we had like uh

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
roughly 400 people joining us in the

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
conference room so i

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,840
was super excited this year it's again

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
a big change uh we made it live

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
uh so we hope that everything works fine

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,000
we never know

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
but uh we pray for the demogods um

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
so i would say thank to all of you all

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
right um

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
so let me start by telling you a bit

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,960
which are the uh ingredients of

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
no hat i'm not sure everybody of you

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
know about no hats so let me recap a bit

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,360
uh what is about uh let me start by

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,159
saying that

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,640
uh we came up with this idea last year

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,280
and

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
the goal was to create an international

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,799
conference in italy

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,119
uh so we had a few sporadic events in

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,360
italy that were mainly

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,759
i would say only for italian basically

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,960
very small

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,600
uh the community is kind of close uh

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,479
close community

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,000
so we wanted to bring like an

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
international vibe in italy similar

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,880
to other conference ekis conference but

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,360
there are all around the world and

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,640
it was missing something like that in

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
italy so that was our starting point

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
and the event we want to create was an

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,840
event that was

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,880
fact-based uh what does it mean it means

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
that what is present here is present on

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
a ground truth so we have uh

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
so we present real things so you know

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,479
it's not like

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,479
you know a vendor talk with people that

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
are saying okay i did this i did that

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,799
one but

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,318
you know we don't know what's going on

62
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,239
so it's really fact-based

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,720
and as a consequence of that uh it's

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
driven by novelty

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
by research so i'm not saying that all

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
the content you see today is new has

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
never been presented before

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,599
but the final goal be to uh

69
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
to give you something more of what uh

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,400
you may have already experienced

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
somewhere else so it's a bit like if you

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,280
go eating

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,000
in a michelin restaurant you expect the

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,959
nova dish to be

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,920
uh something like uh uh something new

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,519
right but you have not maybe eat

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
somewhere else that's why you go and you

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,000
pay

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,599
you pay more to be like in a michelin

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,440
restaurant

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,720
uh as a consequence of of all of this

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
uh we based our program on a fair

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,319
selection process so

84
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,239
we have called for paper but also we

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,599
call for people we're trying to be as

86
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
honest as possible so we don't want to

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,920
be

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
those kinds of conference that invite

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
always you know the friends of the

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,640
friends

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
or always you know uh people they know

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,239
or even worse

93
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,800
you know uh uh people that come speaking

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
because uh they pay for

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
for a slot right uh so that's very

96
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,159
important for us

97
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,800
uh and also as a result of this it's our

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
event is vendor neutral

99
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
in the sense that we don't want to be

100
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,879
influenced by sponsors of course we have

101
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
sponsor because all of these costs

102
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
but we don't want you know to have a

103
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
vendor track we don't want sponsor to be

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
able to give a presentation

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,239
so we are not influenced by sponsor and

106
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,280
uh

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
last but not least is uh uh our work is

108
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
based on uh is a voluntary effort what

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,080
does it mean it means that we are uh

110
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
i mean the company itself is not driven

111
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,080
by uh

112
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
by profit so there is no company that

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,440
operates such

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,560
uh no hat but it's uh organized by a

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,599
non-profit

116
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,239
uh organization so we had a group of uh

117
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,519
a few people

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
uh we do it just for fun uh we do it in

119
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,799
our spare time

120
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
uh that's why we run it over the weekend

121
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,159
and uh

122
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,799
i think this gives a lot of value to uh

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,319
to what we do

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
and uh about the name uh so many people

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
might wonder

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
why no hat so what does it mean i'm not

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,478
going now into the long discussion about

128
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,959
why no hat uh because it would burn all

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,759
my time

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,320
uh you may wanna check uh my opening

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
last year at 2019 but to give you

132
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
just a small bite of what night is about

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,720
um

134
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
we really don't i mean i personally

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
don't think but other people agree with

136
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,160
me but

137
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
there is no really this much distinction

138
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
nowadays between a white hat

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
and the black hat so what does it mean

140
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,919
it takes for example someone working for

141
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,040
a governmental

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,759
agency or a law enforcement agency and

143
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,479
you are paid

144
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,720
to uh discover zero days vulnerability

145
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
and draw and

146
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
develop for example uh new exploits for

147
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
for those vulnerability

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
all right you know you are you have

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
actually a contra right with someone

150
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
actually with the state

151
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
for example so you might think you are a

152
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
white hat right because you are

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
legitimate by that counter but

154
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,759
is it really what what you're doing in

155
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,120
you know disclosing and

156
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
finding zero days vulnerability and

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
selling relatable to the government i'm

158
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
not sure

159
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
and what instead of the other side here

160
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
suppose you have like a script kitty

161
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
uh that you know uh is an activist and

162
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
fight against them

163
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,639
i don't know for example the illegal

164
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,160
fishing of a uh

165
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
two knives mediterranean sea so at that

166
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
point uh

167
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,600
what it does is you know it defaced

168
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,039
basically their home page

169
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
website of of one of those companies

170
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
that operate illegal fishing in the

171
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
mediterranean sea uh

172
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
so can you classify this script kitty uh

173
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
as a as a black hat does it really hurt

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,919
to you know

175
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
the community i don't know so that's

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
really uh

177
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
what we have on the table uh we want to

178
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
have talk that are both offensive and

179
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
both defensive

180
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,840
uh and so we want to to be actually

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
impartial against what is white and what

182
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
is black

183
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
so let me give you uh some some photos

184
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,800
of

185
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,440
the people that are behind bergamo in

186
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,000
the middle which

187
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
is the no profit organization that

188
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
organized no hat

189
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
uh so here we have one of our voluntary

190
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,680
uh that is preparing

191
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
uh our uh last year speaker box uh visa

192
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,919

193
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
that we fill up with a local italian

194
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240

195
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440

196
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
us preparing basically present for our

197
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
speakers

198
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,199
i was also to mention that also for this

199
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
year we have of course

200
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,759

201
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,479
by pass

202
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,919
we don't have a way to meet each other

203
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
but i hope that sooner or later

204
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
depending on how efficient the post uh

205
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
delivery is you will receive a present

206
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
as well

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,039
this is myself uh trying one of our beta

208
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
t-shirts that we designed last year

209
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
uh this is our uh taxi driver if you

210
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,120
want so of course we couldn't afford

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,960
uh to pick up people from the airport to

212
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,039
pick up people from the train station

213
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,240

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,800
this car

215
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
personalize this car with a no-hat logo

216
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,039
and operate as a service

217
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
uh to bring actually people to the

218
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,120
conference center and so on

219
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240

of course we had as well a post

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
conference party because you know

282
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
uh there is no akish conference if there

283
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
is no past conference party so we we

284
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,839
rent a

285
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
pub and we bring there more than 400

286
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
people and we

287
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,839
we just you know meet up and exchange

288
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,399
impression of the conference

289
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,640
all right so let's go to uh what

290
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
happened this year 2020. so our menu for

291
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
this year const

292
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
consists of my friend sawmill that will

293
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,279
give a keynote on cyberspace in general

294
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
i'm going to introduce him in a few

295
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
minutes

296
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
then we have presentation on malware and

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
binary analysis

298
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
so pretty technical stuff and very

299
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,079
invaluable we continue with technical

300
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
stuff uh we have some friends from

301
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,320
russia

302
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
uh discussing the uh some of the flows

303
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,120
um that they found on the architectural

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
motor computers

305
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
uh then we talked of how to

306
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,079
automatically find

307
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,120
bugs uh in application so that's also

308
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,079
technical as well

309
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,680
and then we concluded something a bit

310
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,519
softer but not really so we talked about

311
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,000
deep fake which was an emerging problem

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
nowadays

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
and uh web vulnerabilities we have two

314
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,079
talks

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,560
related to web vulnerabilities so the

316
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,360
agenda is

317
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,560
pretty packed uh we try to uh

318
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,120
condensate the talk in 30 minutes so

319
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
we'll have like 30 minutes talk

320
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
plus q a and we've

321
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
one coffee break in the afternoon and

322
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
one lunch break of course

323
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
in the middle uh very important is that

324
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
you guys are the conference what i mean

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,959
it means

326
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,360
uh the conference would not exist

327
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,440
without the attendees i mean nobody you

328
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
know is going to present uh

329
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
to uh to a wall you know it makes i mean

330
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,720
it makes

331
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
it it's really funny to present in front

332
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
of you know people so

333
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
you are listening to my presentation you

334
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,240
are attending the conference

335
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
uh you can actually interact with each

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,519
other you can interact

337
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,800
with uh with organizer and most

338
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
importantly you can make questions with

339
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,519
speakers

340
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
uh so there is a q a endpoint

341
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
uh which is uh um actually it's this qr

342
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,040
code is on the screen you can take a

343
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,760
photo

344
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,959
or the address that it is live

345
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
so there is a web app based on the slido

346
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
uh it's very simple

347
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
you can make questions you can interact

348
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
so there is a general page

349
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
uh for general chatting and then there

350
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,519
is a

351
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
there are different pages if you want or

352
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
different channels

353
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
one per presentation and every time

354
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,240
presenter is done so for example when

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,200
someone will be done with this

356
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
presentation you will have a new room

357
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
called sawmill that you can join

358
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
to make sure to make a call to make

359
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
questions so this is how it works it's

360
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
very simple

361
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
uh then again i want to say that uh

362
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
