1
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,600
hello

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
hello marco gandolfi speaking so

3
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
uh i'm the host for the

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,119
talks we will have this morning

5
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,760
i will introduce some of the speakers

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,720
some chat on them

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,159
introduce their talk and so on so uh

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,960
let's start with the first uh speaker

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,040
that has been submitted for

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
uh the submitted for go for paper

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000
um she's a

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
axel abreville she's a principal

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
security researcher

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,520
at fortinet and she's a specialized

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,840
she specialized on malware for smart

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,759
devices um

17
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
whether they can be smartphone or other

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,320
connected devices iot and so on

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,439
um so she typically goes under the

20
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,560
handle cryptex

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,119
cryptogoa etc in earlier life she

22
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,159
implemented

23
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,320
some crypto algorithms um

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
she she has been also the head of the

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
international crypto group

26
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,318
uh in his uh previous life

27
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,680
uh this means so she was uh

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
animating an internal group of crypto

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
experts

30
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,800
writing uh uh writing crypto algorithm

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
uh providing some advices on

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,319
cryptographic

33
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,440
algorithms and doing some studies

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,239
uh she's also the lead organizer of ph

35
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,920
own

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
so an analog captured the flag dedicated

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
to smart devices

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
and uh yeah so uh as you will see

39
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,319
she likes to hack to create and learn

40
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,000
so this talk she she's going to present

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,440
uh focuses on malicious android apps

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
which fake as a or which fake or abuse

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
medical situation so we'll follow some

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
reverse engineering live um

45
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
of the kovit 19 malicious app and the

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,480
demo of a useful tool she

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,040
she developed for first uh

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
static analysis or let's say reverse

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
engineering

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
um so this this can be something

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,040
really interesting in my opinion for

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
larger scale analysis of

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,840
apks and so on

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,040
we will also discuss about other medical

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
malwares on android

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
and some uh and she will also provide

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,680
some advice uh

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,280
uh other cyber hygiene

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
uh while using your android smartphone

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
okay so uh i have uh

61
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,519
i have to have to so let's start with a

62
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,239
with a video with a with a talk and uh

63
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,599
we will meet

64
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
uh excel right after the talk

65
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,159
for a quick uh for a quick question and

66
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,879
answer

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,439
so let's make sure that you will post

68
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,799
your answers

69
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,840
during the talk live um

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,120
using no hat dot id slash live

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,399
delete there is a slido uh

72
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,519
iframe where you you can choose the

73
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
uh access room and put your questions

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
questions there and don't be afraid to

75

put questions uh

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
you can also write in italian we can we

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
can translate

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
them later okay bye

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,680
good morning and thank you for joining

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
this session

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
after well and then entertaining

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
keynotes on humans in cyber

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,960
space we are going to discuss now

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
malware in cyberspace um more precisely

85
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,639
it is going to be

86
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,880
malware affecting medical applications

87
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
so let me go to my next slide there we

88
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,160
go

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
um what you're going to notice in this

90
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,280
um

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,320
in this presentation is that well there

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
are only 10 slides which is pretty short

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,120
right

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
this is because most of this talk is

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
going to be about

96
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
the live reverse of an interesting

97
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,400
malware um

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,479
on this uh topic um however to be honest

99
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,120
30 minutes is most of the time not

100
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
sufficient

101
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
to go in depth in the reverse

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,479
engineering of

103
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,600
the malware so um

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
if you are interested really into

105
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
digging into this malware well you can

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
have a look

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
at some two articles i wrote on medium

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
this one is part two and part one is

109
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,320
just below

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,600
so you go to cryptex.medium.com and you

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
will

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
locate the articles without any issue

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,759
there

114
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,479
so it will help you you know just go

115
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,919
further and finish

116
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
uh the reverse engineering of the of the

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,479
malware

118
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
so who am i well i'm a malware

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
researcher at fortinet

120
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
and i specialize in the reverse

121
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
engineering of

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
mobile malware mostly android

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,280
and also lots of malware on iot

124
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,030
okay so any kind of strange malware

125
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,240
[Music]

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
usually ends up for me to look into more

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
precisely

128
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,319
i'm also the lead organizer of phone cf

129
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
which is ctf which is dedicated

130
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
to challenges on smart devices

131
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
it's a local ctf but it's not very far

132
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
from italy so

133
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
it is close to nice and sofianti police

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,039
if you happen to be there or want to and

135
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,720
are able to travel to

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
um to france at that time we'll be glad

137
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
of course to see you

138
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,919
so um it's not obvious for everybody

139
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
that there are actually lots of medical

140
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,199
applications

141
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,400
on your on smartphones okay uh for

142
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
people who need it of course

143
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
but there are really lots um for example

144
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,960
those two are for people with diabetes

145
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,240
it's quite typical that

146
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,039
medical conditions which are chronic

147
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,080
well people

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
tend to develop applications to help

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,520
people cope

150
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
with those and this is usually

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
quite usual on on an android smartphone

152
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
for instance to know how much

153
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
you have eaten or what was your latest

154
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,160
glucose level

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,039
things like that some other apps are

156
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,680
connected

157
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
to smart devices and this is the case of

158
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
those two

159
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,520
where it's connected hearing aids and

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
they are connected to your smartphone

161
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,160
okay and you can just adjust the

162
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,800
settings

163
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,759
of your hearing aid so that it's okay

164
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,240
and it

165
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,599
works the the best way for you okay

166
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,120
um what do we have else else so um

167
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,319
we have those three which are if you

168
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,599
want to

169
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
uh see a medical doctor okay you get a

170
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
video with a doctor and

171
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,479
discuss this or that problem um

172
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,479
this is for menstruation for women

173
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,319
of course another you've got lots of

174
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
applications for that as well

175
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,680
you've got applications for

176
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
cardiac issues or cardiac care so this

177
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
one

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
is for my care link and it helps

179
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,320
you know um well you can

180
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,679
read information from your

181
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,719
uh your pacemaker or your deafblind

182
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
defibrillator and send it afterwards to

183
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,000
um uh to the medical servers or

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
to a doctor and this is the app that

185
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
helps with that

186
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
um this one i think it is connected to

187
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,440
a smart smart watch and tells you warns

188
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,839
you

189
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,320
when you were close to having the

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
seizure

191
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,440
um you've got those those three are um

192
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,399
covet related okay this one you might

193
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:12,800
know

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
we will discuss it um quite a while

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,399
afterwards

196
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
um it was developed in italy

197
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,640
um the other two are french applications

198
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,279
um this one is an application if you are

199
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,399
traveling to

200
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
sicily and yeah okay

201
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
i think i've basically covered all but

202
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,680
you will find them

203
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
if not so do check on on google play and

204
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
you you will see what they are for

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
and there are lots more of course uh

206
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
which are used in

207
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,320
for real medical issues okay

208
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
um now the issue

209
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
and we are going to discuss in this talk

210
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
of course is that

211
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,440
all those apps well there are also

212
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
malicious apps well

213
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,760
uh sorry i've got to make this clear

214
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,720
those are

215
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
a genuine applications okay those

216
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,720
they are fine okay but some other times

217
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
they get

218
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,839
infected compromised by a malware author

219
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,160
who

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,120
injects a malware and the application

221
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,079
that's one

222
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
possibility or a malware author

223
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,399
creates a totally fake application and

224
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,519
that's how we have what i call medical

225
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,720
malware okay um so those those are just

226
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,519
the lists

227
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
and um i've cut it okay about

228
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,760
malware for diabetes or which are

229
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
affecting

230
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,000
applications that are meant to cope one

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
way or another with diabetes

232
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
those is one of those are for psychiatry

233
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
those are for instance for chronic

234
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
diseases

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
chronic bronchitis those are for

236
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
leukemia i i can't really understand

237
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
yeah how somebody would

238
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,399
intentionally infect such an application

239
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
but

240
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
of course you are probably aware that

241
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
most of the time this is

242
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,079
totally automated okay

243
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,279
cardiac issues cardiac arrest cardiac

244
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,240
nursing care

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
care plans cardiac cane i mean there's

246
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
lots of things

247
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,200
and of course covet 19 nowadays

248
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
with many many apps and also many fake

249
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
apps and also many

250
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
infected apps okay

251
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
so this is precisely the topic of this

252
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
talk

253
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,880
so what do you have in those malware

254
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
well

255
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,240
pretty much what you find in any other

256
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
malware you've got lots of

257
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,760
adwares spyware scams

258
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
lots of those but you also have the

259
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,079
typical malware like

260
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,000
ransomware um screen lockers

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,880
uh crypto lockers which are encrypting

262
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,440
your

263
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
your files um screen captures recording

264
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
audio

265
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,800
key loggers i don't know whatever

266
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
everything that you actually

267
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
find uh usually in another malware

268
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,519
um so that's the bad news the good news

269
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,160
however

270
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
is that so far we haven't

271
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
ever located any

272
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
malware that is really manipulating

273
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
medical values like a malware that would

274
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,120
um connect to your pacemaker and

275
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,880
have it um stop or have it

276
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,079
work in an abnormal way okay this does

277
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,800
not exist

278
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
it exists in fiction and it has been

279
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
very much discussed because it is a

280
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
kind of a typical scenario but it does

281
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,000
not fortunately exist for real

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
it could however exist it's not

283
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,079
technic uh technically impossible and

284
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,040
especially for very important people

285
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,839
there is

286
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,120
um a risk and something perhaps to look

287
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,920
into

288
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,200
um if you're not a vip like i am not a

289
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
vip

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
your main concern will be with the lots

291
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,399
of the other

292
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,200
possibilities uh for malware that you

293
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,160
you can have

294
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
um typically uh or ransomware if you

295
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,440
have

296
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,720
medical malware which is a ransomware

297
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
and which prevents you from using this

298
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,760
or that

299
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
medical device or just making your

300
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
smartphone

301
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,440
uh unavailable and you can't communicate

302
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,560
any longer with

303
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
this or that medical device this is

304
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
going to be a real issue

305
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,279
okay for you so that's what it is that's

306
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,279
the kind of the status

307
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,560
um the one now we are going to

308
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
reverse live is this one it is um

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,760
a covet 19 contact tracing application

310
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,519
and as no hat was meant to be hosted

311
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,880
in italy um i thought it would be

312
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
interesting for you for everybody to

313
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,839
to target more specifically on um

314
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
an application which was developed in

315
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
italy so it was

316
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,959
developed around march 2020 perhaps a

317
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:15,440
little

318
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,639
a few months a few weeks before um

319
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
and of course um the application which

320
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,480
is uh

321
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,519
which was developed was totally genuine

322
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,240
i mean it's not

323
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
a malware okay but it got

324
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
targeted by malware authors and malware

325
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,560
authors

326
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,040
decided to repackage it and insert

327
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,279
some malicious payload in in the malware

328
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,480
if you want to find exactly the sample i

329
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
am going to look into it is there

330
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
and those are the two reference articles

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
where you can find the rest

332
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
the remaining of um of the study

333
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,720
if you wish to so

334
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,120
um i want to show something more

335
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
so yeah um this is a very interesting

336
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,360
report there

337
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
cti investigation into covet 19 contact

338
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
tracing apps

339
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
it was in july 30th and that's where

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,040
actually

341
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,639
i saw the mention to this application

342
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,519
and you go down there to all the list of

343
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,720
covet 19

344
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
malicious applications and for italy you

345
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,079
find

346
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,519
this one sm underscore code with 19

347
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
and that's where uh it says okay i hope

348
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,199
it's

349
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,880
readable for you um

350
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,079
it says repackaged application injected

351
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
with metasploit

352
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,600
which is a bit strange the way it is um

353
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
formulated because metasploit is not a

354
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,800
malware it's just an infrastructure to

355
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,279
test various exploits or to develop to

356
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
develop exploits right

357
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,000
so i thought what exactly do they mean

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,399
and

359
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
what does this look like okay so

360
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,959
i grabbed one of the samples and

361
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
um that's so what we are going to um

362
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
to reverse now so

363
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,519
the first thing i am going to show

364
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,279
is actually a video of the malware

365
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,279
in action so no i am shifting to the

366
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
right place

367
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,759
um it is over there

368
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,199
now that videos and there we go

369
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,639
so there um i'm getting the sample

370
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,120
that's

371
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,399
the sum of the sample i

372
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
mentioned in the slides before and i'm

373
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,759
installing it

374
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
on an emulator okay we're working on an

375
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,360
emulator it's

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,120
always safer um

377
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,480
so then well it installed as you can see

378
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,199
as you can see now what we are going to

379
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,880
do

380
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
is that we are going to get into the

381
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,640
hands of an attacker

382
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
and uh see what's uh on from the

383
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,880
attacker's side

384
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
what is going to happen

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
but first of all we need to know what is

386
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,559
the ip address of the attacker

387
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
and this ip address is mentioned in the

388
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,120
sample it is hard coded in the sample so

389
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,760
we need to

390
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,039
find it in the sample so i

391
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,160
unzip the sample as you can see and then

392
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,039
in the dalvik is executable i am going

393
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
to look for the ip address there it is

394
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
that's the ip address and

395
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,200
with a specific port um

396
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,919
let me jump a little bit so now we're

397
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,880
going to

398
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
redirect this ip address to

399
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
my own laptop okay so that's everything

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
that was meant to go to um

401
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
the attacker will actually go onto my

402
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
laptop where i'm going to run metasploit

403
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
so i had done the redirection previously

404
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
um

405
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,240
i'm jumping a little bit forward we are

406
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
going to start

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
metasploit well that is metasploits uh

408
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,440
cons

409
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,720
console so

410
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
this is from the attacker's perspective

411
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
again okay

412
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,520
and we are going to use a specific

413
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,160
exploit

414
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,280
which is um a reverse shell

415
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,320
uh meter preterm okay so

416
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,080
we get it from the android directory

417
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,760
reverse shell reverse tcp

418
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,919
and then we've got to specify well the

419
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,600
ip address of or

420
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
asked my house there is locally

421
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,120
on 192.168.0.42

422
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,559
and then we need the port 24079

423
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,840
and we launch it

424
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,240
it says a river shell so it is going to

425
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,039
wait for an active connection to come

426
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,919
from

427
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,320
the victim so the victim on the emulator

428
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
clicks on the

429
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,919
the application which looks perfectly

430
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,480
real as you can see

431
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,039
and on the other side the attacker

432
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,400
immediately gets a shell

433
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,679
where with plenty of commands he or she

434
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,080
can

435
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
uh kiss you so like listing all apps on

436
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,640
them on the

437
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,600
phone checking if the device is rooted

438
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
well it's an emulator so

439
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,840
it's rooted uh in that case um

440
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,360
well we can dump sms

441
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
and we can read the sms which were on

442
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,440
the emulator

443
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,559
so there okay i love messages about

444
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,159
chocolate so don't forget to buy

445
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,760
chocolate

446
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,039
and if you go actually on the smartphone

447
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,320
you can check that

448
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,679
those are really um the

449
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
the two messages which are on the

450
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
smartphone

451
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
um even better you can also down the

452
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,880
contacts

453
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
again it's an emulator it's down just

454
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
for tests so

455
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,120
what you get as contacts as you can see

456
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,520
it's

457
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,640
john doe not really interesting but we

458
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,280
can check

459
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,559
that indeed we have john doe listed as a

460
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,679
contact

461
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,960
and that his phone number is the correct

462
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,520
one

463
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,440
so now i don't need that and

464
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
the knight says there john doe and the

465
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,439
phone number is correct

466
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
what else can we do well we can try

467
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
actually if you if you want you can

468
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
set that up and try it at home

469
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
or at work there are plenty of other

470
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
commands you can list

471
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,480
webcams so you've got a front one

472
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,080
and a back one and you can try and

473
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,679
get a snapshot so here

474
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,799
i'm getting a snapshot of um the back

475
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,760
one

476
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,159
uh this is the emulator okay so it's

477
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,120
normal that

478
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,159
you get this specific picture it's a

479
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,080
hard-coded picture

480
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,760
um yum

481
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,130
that's not extremely interesting

482
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,840
[Music]

483
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,840
um and we can get also a screenshot

484
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
so yeah you can't get a screenshot if um

485
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,440
unless you are in the application which

486
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
is compromised so

487
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
um i'm gonna launch the covet 19

488
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,159
application and there start again

489
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,159
and try and do the screenshot and you

490
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
will see that it works

491
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,880
works really well honestly uh all of

492
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
this all the commands i was surprised

493
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
most of the time when you try something

494
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
it doesn't work immediately here

495
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
i get everything yeah and it's exactly

496
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
the same screen

497
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,200
okay that we get okay so this is really

498
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,470
just to show you how

499
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,840
[Music]

500
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
um

501
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
how the malware is supposed to work

502
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
um now we are going to reverse that so

503
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,520
i'm going to

504
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,200
open um the sample in

505
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,039
uh jeb jeb is um a disassembler

506
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,480
it's um a really good disassembler

507
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
the only issue with it i guess is that

508
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
you have to pay for it

509
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
but um if you want to you can stick to

510
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
open source and free

511
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,640
and free software to to do

512
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,280
nearly the same tasks the decompilers

513
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,760
aren't always as good it depends but

514
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,919
i like this tool myself anyway um

515
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,039
we're going to have a look at the

516
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,919
manifests um you can see that there's

517
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
lots of permissions but it's not obvious

518
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,760
initially

519
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,840
okay if those are applications needed

520
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
really by the real application or

521
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
if those have been added by um the

522
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
malicious payload which is inserted

523
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,760
um we locate over here

524
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,600
the main so the main is going to be

525
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,159
called

526
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,120
it soft mining projects covert 19 safe

527
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,840
lifestyle

528
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,950
main activity okay and then

529
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,799
[Music]

530
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,360
there's something interesting so this it

531
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,480
software mining project

532
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,640
namespace is the real namespace of

533
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
of the real application the genuine

534
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,120
application

535
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,240
but what is strange is just afterwards

536
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,760
as a service we can see this obfuscated

537
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,880
name

538
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,799
xmevv and this is a little bit strange

539
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,440
okay so we can go and have a look

540
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,760
and we're gonna go in there and all

541
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
those are the

542
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,880
files uh of the real application

543
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
and then there's one directory which is

544
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
obfuscated and

545
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
with several other

546
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,440
classes which are obfuscated as well so

547
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,320
we go in there

548
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
and we see this is a service um

549
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
it is calling another one which is

550
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
obfuscating and starting

551
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
and calling the start method here we

552
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,170
see it does some

553
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,240
[Music]

554
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,760
reflection calls okay calling current

555
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,720
application

556
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,919
this is not extremely um you you

557
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,760
wouldn't see that really in a

558
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,679
normal application most of the time it's

559
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,760
kind of a little bit suspicious

560
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,559
it can be for real but it's slightly

561
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,320
suspicious already there

562
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,679
so we're gonna have a look at this one

563
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,640
which is mentioned there so this one is

564
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
a bit bigger so it takes a little bit of

565
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,799
time

566
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,640
to decompile but the soft is pretty

567
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,820
pretty big pretty pretty good

568
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,080
[Music]

569
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,559
come on

570
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
there we go and third decompose and you

571
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,799
see there's um

572
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,400
a very large bite array

573
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
okay so pretty pretty strange again

574
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,559
doing something about get packet manure

575
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,080
manager

576
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,360
um this if you were used into

577
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
to seeing something like that in malware

578
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,640
this

579
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,679
is something that hides um

580
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,320
the application icon so you know this is

581
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,919
really looking strange

582
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,559
then a little bit later on you see that

583
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,000
well you know

584
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,440
we are obviously loading a decks

585
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,000
there and then calling a method called

586
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,400
startin.dex again

587
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,919
um this happened in some aggressive

588
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,400
uh adware but um it really smells bad

589
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,640
okay and then we go a little bit down

590
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,279
there we see that it's using a socket

591
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,559
interesting

592
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,679
somewhere this is about

593
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,360
typically seeing if um

594
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,679
their smartphone is sleeping or not or

595
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,520
not so this is typical power management

596
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
and then oh um

597
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,320
server socket or socket over there

598
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
and there's a connection url connection

599
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,080
this is really really suspicious damn

600
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,520
suspicious

601
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
so there are actually several ways

602
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,200
to to know what is suspicious you we

603
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,440
know that it was in

604
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,880
uh that's something about

605
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,120
a meter preterm um reverse shell was in

606
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,559
in injected in the application so we can

607
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,159
go and have a look

608
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,520
at the sources of that because the

609
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,320
sources

610
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,240
of this um um

611
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,480
of this part of our open source and you

612
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,440
can have a look at it

613
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,200
the most difficult part is actually to

614
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,399
find uh the url where to find

615
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,360
uh this um the source and here we see

616
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,600
this one payload.java

617
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,919
and it really looks like the same okay

618
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,200
we see there's

619
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,159
um an array of configuration bytes so it

620
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,520
seems

621
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:57,930
um

622
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,840
[Music]

623
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
then again we get that

624
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,279
meta call to the current application

625
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,159
we had seen that one um

626
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,120
again power management requiring that

627
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,960
hiding the application icon

628
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,730
um and a little bit down there

629
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,520
[Music]

630
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,880
connecting to a given url

631
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,080
then even more we have those things

632
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
about using a service socket or a socket

633
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,600
depending on

634
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,960
if the host is provided or not

635
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,399
loading bytes

636
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,159
and here yeah here we have loading a

637
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:48,720
decks

638
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
and calling method start so there it is

639
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
okay we have located

640
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,120
our um or a meet up um

641
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,720
in here and this is how it works um

642
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,039
so

643
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,080
we can have a look at that okay

644
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,640
so um at the other way if because it's

645
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
not always that obvious

646
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,919
um at first that this is the malicious

647
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,720
class

648
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,960
the other way if you want to pinpoint it

649
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,559
that it is located

650
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,600
sorry it is located no

651
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,080
i'm gonna get it it's this one uh that

652
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
it is located in this

653
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,039
uh namespace ap z cp

654
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,240
from it soft mining projects uh

655
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,679
in there the way to do that is

656
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,440
to use droid loses so droid losses is

657
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,399
a tool of mine okay um so this is

658
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,480
shameless advertisements now i'm joking

659
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
it's open source so

660
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,440
okay you can use it or not like it or

661
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,760
not

662
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,399
improve it you're just welcome to do to

663
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,360
do that

664
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,150
all the time it's um

665
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,039
[Music]

666
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,159
i find it personally pretty useful at

667
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,159
first when i'm beginning a reverse

668
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
engineering because it um it explains

669
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,080
uh well it shows what calls api call api

670
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
calls are being done on your um your

671
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,679
sample

672
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,559
and then from there you have kind of

673
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,000
entries of which are

674
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,279
maybe a little bit um suspicious

675
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,120
and you can start and do your reverse

676
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
engineering and those areas and think oh

677
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
i found that a little bit suspicious so

678
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,600
i am going to have a look

679
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,360
more precisely at that okay so

680
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,960
um as you can see

681
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,840
it is takes a few seconds to

682
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,000
process um always too long when

683
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,559
you're doing a demonstration

684
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,519
hopefully it will end soon it's usually

685
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,720
just a few seconds

686
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,399
okay to to get the things uh processing

687
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,678
and have it work

688
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,010
there we go it's gonna show everything

689
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,109
[Music]

690
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
soon

691
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,360
ah come on

692
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
there we go okay so you get everything

693
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,559
about well the application the

694
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,000
activities main activity

695
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
permissions and things like that but the

696
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,679
thing which is the most interesting in

697
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,399
my humble

698
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,760
opinion is that the following parts

699
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,159
there

700
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,640
which tell you that okay the the

701
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,440
application

702
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,480
well the sample is is using dex

703
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,960
class loader for instance okay so this

704
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,679
is already

705
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,440
kind of suspicious because it shouldn't

706
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,200
really be used it's using encryption

707
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,039
it's digging information from your

708
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,919
package retrieving the host ip address

709
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,320
okay

710
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,440
might happen posting information

711
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,279
via http request using reflection

712
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,919
sockets also and things like that okay

713
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,559
so

714
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,600
at least in there which i i when i see

715
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,559
this

716
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,039
i would think okay this is unusual that

717
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,039
an application is using sockets

718
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,120
and using dex class loader i'm gonna

719
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,240
have a look where

720
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,760
exactly it is using that so there you go

721
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,960
in the directory this was created by

722
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,200
drought lizis

723
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,960
and in auto analyzes we are going to

724
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,360
look

725
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,279
for um text class loader

726
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,159
there it is and we see that all mentions

727
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:54,799
to the

728
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,000
class loader are from this uf

729
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,679
web class there it is ufo uf web

730
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,279
and then socket socket same thing uf web

731
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,720
um and sockets here uf web again

732
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,440
so it already it kind of gives you okay

733
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
i've got to go and see

734
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,880
in this directory that's the way you can

735
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,799
you can really understand where you have

736
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,600
to go

737
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,799
for your reverse engineering

738
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,120
now um time is flying back

739
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,399
by so i've got to wrap this session

740
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,760
quite quickly um the only the last thing

741
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
i wanted to show you there

742
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,320
is how does this service gets called

743
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,120
okay it's

744
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,559
it is here but how does this get started

745
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,600
so how it gets started is pretty

746
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,090
interesting because actually um

747
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,480
[Music]

748
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,679
where is that it's a little bit below i

749
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,440
think yeah

750
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,360
yeah the application line here

751
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,279
you've got to read it through with

752
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,240
details and you see over here

753
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,239
that it is whoops that it is

754
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,399
a multi-decks application most of the

755
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,960
time small applications you only have

756
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,399
one dalvik executable but

757
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,960
with time this was insufficient and

758
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,159
android introduced

759
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,639
the possibility to have several dalvik

760
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,918
executables

761
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,560
and this one the sample is using several

762
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,199
text executables and when you have that

763
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,399
well you've got to tell android that

764
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,760
you're using

765
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,839
that and if we go so in android x

766
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,639
multi decks

767
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,650
multi-dex application

768
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,820
[Music]

769
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,599
this is where everything is going to

770
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,159
start

771
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,440
for the application and just see it

772
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,079
there

773
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,200
this is where our service gets started

774
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
and this is really an interesting way of

775
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,520
doing things because

776
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
the start of this malicious

777
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,079
service is done from a class which is

778
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,960
located in android x multi-dex package

779
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,040
which is something which is from google

780
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
and that most of the time you won't go

781
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
and look into those at that namespace

782
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,440
because it will be just the standard

783
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,880
um uh android stuff okay so

784
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,440
you might miss that one and this i think

785
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
is um

786
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,640
an intelligent way of starting and

787
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,000
stealing and

788
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,720
and remaining under the radar kind of

789
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,920
so um yeah unfortunately i'm

790
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,320
already slightly over time so i'm going

791
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,359
to wrap it up really very quickly

792
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,160
if you want to have more information go

793
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,640
and see

794
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
my articles on cryptex medium and you'll

795
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,000
have

796
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,880
even really more details on this

797
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,480
particular sample

798
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
you've got also lots of other

799
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,560
documentation which are already related

800
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,280
to medical apps over there

801
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,359
and thank you very much for your

802
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,720
attention

803
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,240
um and i will be available of course for

804
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,000
questions and answers

805
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
and um also on twitter or you can send

806
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,599

809
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,280
hello again hello excel how are you

very good so thank you very much for

813
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,000
your

814
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,359
for your talk uh it has been very

815
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,200
so interesting and practical so

816
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
um i wanted to to to

817
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,440
um i wanted to present you some of the

818
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,200
questions from uh

819
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,560
our audience so they posted uh

820
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,000
some some question on on the slider chat

821
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,599
in the in the dedicated room um

822
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,480
uh first uh the first question is uh

823
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
related to

824
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,560
the initial analysis you did uh

825
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,920
so related to these malicious apps um

826
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,079
so were the malicious apps that you

827
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,440
listed published to the

828
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
official play store uh any other

829
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,359
unofficial store

830
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,440
or only downloadable as well as an apk

831
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,040
okay um so um

832
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,680
for the application we've been reversing

833
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,800
live

834
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,079
i do not think that it was on the play

835
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,599
store

836
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,839
it's it's difficult to know at this time

837
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,960
because

838
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,320
um what happens is that i

839
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,720
reversed this application around

840
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,760
september

841
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,160
but it was out in march okay so a long

842
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,760
time ago

843
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
[Music]

844
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,359
in terms of of applications life that's

845
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:55,680
like

846
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,960
you know lives ago just a few months

847
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,320
um it appears that most people

848
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
got this malware from

849
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,119
phishing links okay so it wasn't

850
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,280
directly on on the play store for that

851
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,800
one but there were

852
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,079
other coveted 19 uh malicious

853
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,440
apps which were found on the play store

854
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,720
and i remind reminds me of

855
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,000
it was um india's uh arogya situ

856
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,040
contact application um one of those

857
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,800
was um so compromised and found

858
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,920
on the play store for a couple of um

859
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,960
hours or days i can't exactly know

860
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,240
so okay short no for this one

861
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,280
uh but yes for others

862
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
good so uh so this is my question so

863
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,880
uh do you think an approach like the one

864
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,160
you presented so

865
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
uh quite automated for the initial

866
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,680
analysis of at risk for

867
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,800
for an initial reversing could be

868
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
applied or is applied by

869
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,440
google when vetting the applications

870
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,560
that are played on the

871
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,640
that are that are published on their

872
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,960
store

873
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,839
[Music]

874
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,400
um um

875
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,359
i i think that the the way i i do it and

876
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,560
do the reversing

877
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,680
is um it's maybe not that easy to um

878
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,640
to automate it uh it's um it's easy when

879
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,000
you have um

880
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,839
when you're a human being behind it

881
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,440
because you kind of intuitively

882
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,839
intuitively know where to go or what is

883
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,040
a bit strange

884
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,680
but it's not always that easy in that

885
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,599
particular case i reversed

886
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,640
um three different application of that

887
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,599
italian contact tracing application

888
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,160
three

889
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
three different malware and one was

890
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
extremely easy to reverse

891
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,680
um because uh they had uh done

892
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
absolutely no obfuscation at all and it

893
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,400
was just

894
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,119
direct we could see where the malicious

895
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,160
part was

896
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,800
this one was um well the first one

897
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,160
wasn't even working

898
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,400
this one is working and it's like

899
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,200
average

900
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,400
uh work to um to reverse it

901
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
and the third one was really difficult

902
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
and unfortunately it's the first one i

903
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,119
started with

904
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,400
so i reversed the uh reversed the

905
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,880
the application and at first to be

906
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,599
honest

907
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,839
i didn't know where i was going to find

908
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,280
that metasploit

909
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
part in it so it took me kind of a

910
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,319
little

911
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,640
time a little time to to locate it in

912
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,079
the code because you've got

913
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,920
you've got plenty of classes in there

914
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
which are perfectly normal

915
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,640
perfectly genuine and you've got to spot

916
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,079
the right one and

917
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,800
of course when the names are changed um

918
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,040
it's not always that easy

919
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,480
so automating it um

920
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,680
i'm sure that google anyway has lots of

921
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,440
tools to

922
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,560
pre um to pre-screen the um

923
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,400
the apps but well you know

924
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,680
it's never going to match um a reverse

925
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,400
engineer

926
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
uh doing the work for specific cases at

927
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,960
least

928
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,079
okay uh so you partly also answer to the

929
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,480
other

930
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,839
two questions probably so um

931
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,920
the second question was how many apps

932
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,400
did you analyze in such campaigns

933
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,760
and the third question was if any other

934
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,839
advanced techniques apart from repacking

935
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,760
backdoors or abusing intents

936
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,000
have been used um and if you found any

937
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
uh usage of native code for example

938
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,880
and uh if yes in which percentage

939
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,839
okay um so lots of questions actually um

940
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:40,240
so

941
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,920
if i i identified the other um how many

942
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,480
i

943
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,160
identified in those campaigns um

944
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
i wouldn't be able to give a number well

945
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,839
an exact number

946
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,920
because my focus there was really to

947
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,880
understand how

948
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,839
this application was working rather than

949
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,640
identify all the copycats for that one

950
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,280
um but um

951
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,839
[Music]

952
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,720
there are at least

953
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,760
more than 10 more than something like 50

954
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,640
and perhaps

955
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,960
far more uh i don't exactly know but

956
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,760
it's not just

957
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,240
one isolated case that's for sure um

958
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,599
as for well advanced techniques um

959
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,720
well i'd say that already this one which

960
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,440
is

961
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,400
injecting metasploit is not something

962
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,040
usual

963
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,960
in what we see in malware okay malware

964
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,520
which are live and that we see in the

965
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,079
wild

966
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,400
tend to be extremely simple in the way

967
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,440
they are coded

968
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,079
and they go direct to the points there's

969
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,880
no use in

970
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,359
uh in using anything which is advanced

971
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,040
when something which is extremely simple

972
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,839
works as well

973
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,880
okay so this is already

974
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,040
not common uh in there

975
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,640
we do not find very much

976
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,920
people really repacking backdoors using

977
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,119
native code

978
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,160
yes it does happen but not

979
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,440
very often i did have um some percentage

980
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,000
but it's

981
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,599
like uh it's an old percentage from 2014

982
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,319
so it probably wouldn't apply exactly

983
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,280
the same now

984
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
in 2014 i think it was less than five

985
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,440
percent of malware which are using

986
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,560
native code

987
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,520
um in 2020 it can be pretty different so

988
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,280
i'm not sure this is really uh

989
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,240
relevant to the question unfortunately i

990
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
think so yeah

991
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,599
um

992
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,280
and yes so yeah just you to answer

993
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,319
again that question um

994
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,319
when we are doing research and we are

995
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,520
researchers and

996
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
speaking to security researchers they

997
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
tend in indeed to ask

998
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,000
do you have anything more advanced uh

999
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,400
well

1000
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,480
um if you go in the wild it doesn't work

1001
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,520
that way

1002
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,040
you don't have advanced things but

1003
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,359
you've got loads of things to

1004
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,240
to work on okay just reminding that we

1005
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,720
have

1006
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,319
more than 25 000 new samples new

1007
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,440
malicious samples

1008
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,560
for android per day

1009
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,880
okay so we've got to deal with that

1010
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,040
that's uh quite a significant amount

1011
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,720
yeah so let me check if there is any

1012
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,599
other question

1013
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,040
on the on the q a

1014
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,079
no no other question for the moment

1015
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,200
um so i encourage the

1016
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,359
the audience to continue to post

1017
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,720
questions on the

1018
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,520
uh slider oh yeah there is an uh there

1019
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
is a questioning coming

1020
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,359
let me check uh yeah

1021
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,960
um hi excel flatter framework is making

1022
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,520
reversing up much harder

1023
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
what do you think i don't know what

1027
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,079
framework is making reversing apps much

1028
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,680
harder

1029
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:05,950

[Music]

1036
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,960

1040

advertisement sdk

1041
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,400
for for that if that is a

1042
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,359
the case um yeah i've dealt with some of

1043
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,000
those and

1044
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,960
any third-party sdks always complicates

1045
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,839
the reversing uh that's obvious all the

1046
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,160
time
