and to all the

21
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,640
uh people interested in security uh

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
you might know samil iran's uh

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
he does a lot of things but what is uh

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
doing lastly is to run a training

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,200
on security uh going from

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
arm exploitation to

27
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
everything basically you can tell more

28
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
about this if you want

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
so if you really want to grow your uh

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,479
your understanding of how things work in

31
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,280
detail

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520

very much appreciated what you bring to

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
thanks a lot

37
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,160

introduce yourself

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
and share whatever you want uh i would

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
say you have uh

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
much more time we have 40 minutes 45

42
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,040
minutes stuff like this

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
so it's up to you and

44
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
after that we will have a short uh i

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
would say 10 minutes maybe q a

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
uh using our slido web app so

47
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
you at this may want to check out how

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,879
this slide works

49
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,360
so you can interact with our speaker

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,640
okay

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,519
i would say ready to go ready to go

52
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,160
great

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,480
thank you thank you marco thanks uh no

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
hat for

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,840
giving me the opportunity to open up the

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,760
conference uh before i go into the talk

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,959
and i go into you know

58
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,720
talking about cyberspace and all i i

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
first want to recognize the

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,360
the great contribution that uh you know

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
folks like marco and the no hat crew

62
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,720
do to the cyber security community over

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,159
the past 20 years i've

64
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
you know started off with small

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
conference uh we've you know gone to

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
like really large conferences

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
but the beauty is in these smaller

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,920
events

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,840
because that's where you get close to

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,000
people that's where you interact

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
one-on-one we are all the same we're cut

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,760
from the same cloth

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
there is no difference between us

74
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
and it is events like this which i

75
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
cherish the most

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
value the most and this is also where i

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
learned

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,200
so i would have loved to be with you

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
folks in person

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
that's an experience which is not

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,400
replaceable but i'll do the best

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,239
best i can being with you folks over

83
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
here and i look forward

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
to working more in person with you folks

85
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,720
going ahead

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
okay my talk i will very quickly get to

87
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
it because 45

88
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
40 minutes is not too long of a time and

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
there's of course a lot of things to say

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
i will apologize to the next speaker

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,720
excel

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
in advance i mean she's awesome and i

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
hope she understands if i creep onto

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
five minutes of her time

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
right on um my talk is titled humans in

96
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
cyberspace

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
it's a fancy title given to basically 20

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,840
years of my own observations

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
as to you know where things are going um

100
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
i would introduce myself as you know the

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
accidental entrepreneur i've been trying

102
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
to run a company for the past 20 years

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
somehow it's working and i i

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,199
call myself an old-schooler now

105
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
because i've been doing this since close

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
to 21 years

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
okay enough of me let's get to the talk

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,720
so talk is

109
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
essentially broken down into four

110
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
sections but they're all interconnected

111
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,039
to each other

112
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,520
i mean first i want to talk about

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,479
evolution

114
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,759
because it's very important to see

115
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,280
where we've come from because that

116
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
defines where we're going to go ahead

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
to a greater letter excels and

118
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
then i want to parallely point out a few

119
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,840
points of

120
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
asymmetry and it is this asymmetry which

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
is kind of causing a lot of

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
imbalance in the world today and we need

123
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
to recognize it

124
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,479
to be able to figure out you know where

125
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
the next swings are going

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
we're certainly not at an equilibrium

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
space

128
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
i don't think we're going to be there in

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
the near future

130
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
we want to see where things are going to

131
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
swing then of course we're going to talk

132
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
about the core subject itself which is

133
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,759
cyberspace

134
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
a lot has been talked about cyberspace

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
we've all lived it but these are just

136
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,000
some of my

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
observations and my views on cyberspace

138
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
which i want to share

139
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
and last but not least we're all infosec

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
professionals

141
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,479
and we are operating in a space

142
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
where we are missing the key ingredient

143
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
that we should be operating upon and

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
this i come to

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
the conclusion after reflecting upon

146
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
myself

147
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
what i have been doing as a cyber

148
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,880
security researcher what i have been

149
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
doing

150
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
as an entrepreneur and what is missing

151
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
for all these 20 years of my career

152
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,800
and that is trust so first and foremost

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
let's talk about evolution

154
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
no discussion on evolution can happen

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,639
without

156
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
respect to the founding fathers of

157
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,639
evolution in my case there are two

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,800
the gentleman on the right left you know

159
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
all very well

160
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,639
uh charles darwin the indirect founder

161
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,319
of the darwin awards

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
which are rather funny but they're

163
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,360
rather

164
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,400
morbid and true the gentleman on the on

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,199
the right

166
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
i am directionally challenged so i'll

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
call right and left inappropriately but

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
the other chapter the glasses his name

169
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,120
is gordon moore

170
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
and he is the founder of intel

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,960
corporation

172
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
he also has an award to his name which

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
is not as morbid as the darwin award

174
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
and also not as funny but the two

175
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
differences between the darwin award and

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
the gordon moore middle

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
darwin awards are awarded posthumously

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
gordon moore

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
medals are awarded within the lifetime

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
of the recipient

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
okay we all know what darwin did but

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
let's talk a little bit about what

183
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,720
more prophesied um 1965

184
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
you know just in the early days of intel

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
gordon moore proposed moore's law

186
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
and that's been something that is

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
driving technology for all these

188
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,759
decades moore's law was simple that

189
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,639
essentially computing power will double

190
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
almost every couple of years costs being

191
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,199
the same

192
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,160
and this led to an exponential curve in

193
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,759
the growth of technology

194
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
today we are all very familiar with how

195
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
exponential curves work with this corona

196
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
corona thing going on around the world

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
so i don't need to explain how

198
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
exponential growth is

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,440
but what moore's law has led to

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,759
is a very distinct power asymmetry

201
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,560
we all know that oil was the power

202
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,000
currency of the 20th century

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,720
in the 21st century data is the power

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,759
currency

205
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
of the world but there are two

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
fundamental differences that we

207
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,080
really need to recognize between oil and

208
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,279
data

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
oil you have to extract it from the

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
earth and when you spend oil

211
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,159
it's gone it does its work and it's over

212
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,000
so if you want to keep accumulating

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
power you have to get more and more oil

214
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,560
um either you do that by digging holes

215
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
into the earth or you do that by

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
invading a country which has a lot of

217
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,080
oil

218
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,360
um whatever you know i'm not an oil gap

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,800
but data is very interesting as uh

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
as a concept because you don't have to

221
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
mine data

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
i mean you don't have to extract data

223
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
from the earth data is all around us we

224
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
pick up data

225
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
but the beauty of data is data

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,680
generates more data

227
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
data if it is used will create more data

228
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,120
and that data will give you more data

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
and will give you more power and

230
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
with more power and more data you get

231
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
more data and so on and so forth it kind

232
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,040
of just like

233
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,240
multiplies by itself and your power

234
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
keeps increasing asymmetrically

235
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,959
and let's see what type of power shift

236
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,560
we've been talking about

237
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,760
this is about you know 16 years uh

238
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
17 years of history i was

239
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
very fortunate to have good friends in

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,040
high places this gentleman in the

241
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,000
picture

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
is a dear friend of mine he and i you

243
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
know went uh

244
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,000
we we lived in the same hometown we we

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
went to school

246
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
pretty much in the same time together we

247
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
met at a community science center and

248
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,560
we both got into programming and all

249
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,399
that during our early years

250
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,560
right and srinidhi he became a professor

251
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,000
at virginia tech

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
in the us and what he built was virginia

253
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,240
tech system

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
10 which was the third fastest

255
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
supercomputer

256
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,560
in the world uh in 2003 it made the top

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
it made the top top 500 super computer

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
list at number three

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,959
but there's two couple of amazing things

260
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
about his super computer and what made

261
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
it so damn special

262
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
is that he clocked a benchmark of

263
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,279
10 teraflops 10 trillion floating point

264
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,640
operations per second

265
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
for less than 10 million dollars and

266
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
this is because he built his super

267
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
computer out of

268
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,839
the first 1100 power mag g5s that apple

269
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,399
actually

270
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
ever produced what you got on the market

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
was the 110 first

272
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,839
g5 the first 1100 straight went to him

273
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
um and he clocked like 12 teraflops on

274
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,440
this

275
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,279
on this network of 1100

276
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,760
commercially available macintoshes

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,440
running system 10.

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
he had to build a very special uh

279
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,480
gigabit

280
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,920
ethernet connect because that there was

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
no gp ethernet in 2003

282
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,120
so he got the infiniband to infiniband

283
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
guys to create the interconnect

284
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
but he ran his super computer out of

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,959
commercially available hardware and

286
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
software

287
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
the price point to build such a

288
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
supercomputer

289
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
would easily be 100 million dollars and

290
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
he demonstrated he could do this in

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,640
a tenth of a cost but that's very

292
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,600
interesting i mean

293
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,880
um that's 17 years ago

294
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
right you may build supercomputers and

295
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
supercomputers are used for it

296
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
really really fancy applications stuff

297
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,560
that you and i cannot afford to compute

298
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
stuff like you know weather predictions

299
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,800
stock markets missile trajectories and

300
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
all sorts of simulations

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
that go on it requires this room full of

302
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
computing

303
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,480
but if we go to this here

304
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,399
if you go to this here we we have the

305
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,959
nvidia xavier right it's it's it's a

306
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,560
machine which is about

307
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,519
smaller than my ipad um it's about four

308
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,720
inches by four inches

309
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
large this machine has 512

310
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
cores and 64 tensor cores this thing

311
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,399
clocks 11 teraflops as fast as screen is

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
super computer

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
the cost for this machine i

314
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
i looked it up on amazon it's about 1600

315
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
us dollars

316
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,279
now what this means is that we have

317
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,639
the super computing capabilities of 2003

318
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
present on everybody's desktop today i

319
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
think pretty much

320
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
vast majority of us if we want to do

321
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
high performance commuting

322
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,480
back then we couldn't afford the

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
supercomputer but now we can afford a

324
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
1600

325
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
nvidia the question is what does this

326
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
mean in terms of capabilities that the

327
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
world has

328
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,399
and we can explore that and

329
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
interestingly enough 2007 is

330
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,160
a year of milestones i consider on many

331
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
many sorts

332
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,399
the first milestone is this is when i

333
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,079
had a personal realization

334
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
after discussing with my father who is a

335
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
hobby electronics

336
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
like my father has built all his

337
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,959
circuits using transistors like your

338
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,040
guitar amplifiers and whatnot he used to

339
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,680
build

340
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
in the 60s and i started i'm not an

341
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,079
electronics guy but

342
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,000
whatever electronics project i started i

343
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639
started with the arduino

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,720
and what it came out to be is that you

345
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
know the microprocessor is the new

346
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,320
transistor

347
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
it is as small and as cheap

348
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
as a transistor 40 years ago

349
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
and now when you start building out

350
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
electronics you have the capabilities of

351
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
a billion transistors available to you

352
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
at like for two cents a piece

353
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,519
uh two cents per chip in 2007

354
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
also saw the birth of several

355
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
evolutionary technologies they had all

356
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,199
matured because evolution doesn't mean

357
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,279
like you create a new product

358
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,560
evolution means is the environment ready

359
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
to support that new fantastic idea that

360
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
you have

361
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
we all have fantastic ideas but somehow

362
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,680
the environment is not

363
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,240
capable of supporting them and they fall

364
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
flat and they die

365
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,519
but you had evolutionary factors like 3g

366
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,680
you know small computers which could be

367
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,079
powered very effectively by batteries

368
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,199
you had gps and with all these

369
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,880
technologies

370
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
the iphone not only could it become a

371
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,199
reality but it could also capture the

372
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,000
market because

373
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,639
it was usable it was a device which had

374
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,760
the right

375
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
right ingredients right price point and

376
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
it had capabilities that could

377
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,519
expand our computing

378
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
abilities and people took to it like a

379
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
storm

380
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,639
we all know what happened after that

381
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
right society

382
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,560
started becoming digital it was the

383
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,839
first step

384
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,040
that humans took and

385
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,360
truly became the social network

386
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
and humans started following two very

387
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
different paths

388
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,279
in reality human beings are conservative

389
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,560
more or less private safeguarded but in

390
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
virtual space

391
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
humans started sharing everything about

392
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,839
their lives

393
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,959
on social media you know we want to show

394
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,639
off we want to show ourselves we want to

395
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:36,959
get

396
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,360
likes and we are you know bragging and

397
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,959
hyping everything up we're trying to

398
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,480
become thought leaders and all that

399
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,279
stuff

400
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
like we started showing off full tilt

401
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,240
and it has not stopped yet

402
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
but the other evolutionary factor that i

403
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,519
want to talk about

404
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,560
is is autonomy and that was

405
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,320
also born out of the same components

406
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
as what was required to create the

407
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,440
iphone

408
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
and the first autonomous device also

409
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,360
started taking off

410
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
around that same time frame which we

411
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
know as the drone

412
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,839
now you may say that oh you know the

413
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,120
drone is nothing new

414
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
right why did it take till like 2007. we

415
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
had radio controlled airplanes we had

416
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,040
radio controlled helicopters

417
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,399
everybody was doing model rc rc flight

418
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,600
stuff

419
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
what's so special about the drone well

420
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
first of all

421
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,680
the technology to do high performance

422
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,880
flight calculations did not exist until

423
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
the arm processors

424
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,680
became sufficiently powerful and why is

425
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
it the arm processor that mattered

426
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,639
because

427
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
the other processors which are powerful

428
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
consumed too much electricity and too

429
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,519
much energy

430
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,480
the arm processor was a first which

431
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,720
could perform at a high capacity

432
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,560
and could be powered off with a battery

433
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,399
small enough that it doesn't add enough

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
it doesn't add weight and the damn thing

435
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,519
can fly

436
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,720
and then it can be self-guided using gps

437
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,240
and controlled using high bandwidth

438
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
cellular technology and that's that's

439
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
what made the drone possible

440
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
and ever since then machine autonomy has

441
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,640
evolved kind of behind the scenes but

442
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
let me show you what the latest and

443
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
greatest of commercial evolution is i do

444
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
not know about military evolution

445
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,679
we're not at westworld yet but what we

446
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,880
have

447
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
isn't very far and here's a

448
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
demonstration

449
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
of a boston dynamics robot doing

450
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,679
some this this thing is doing

451
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
stuff that i can't do like i can't jump

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,360
and bounce and

453
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,320
tumble like this i'd break my bloody

454
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
neck

455
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
but this thing can do it for for you

456
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,360
know years and days to come as long as

457
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
it is powered by

458
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,559
a battery okay with

459
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,160
such capabilities let's kind of connect

460
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
you know let's just just add two and two

461
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,880
and see where we can go with this

462
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,160
right um what if you add guns and

463
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,880
artificial intelligence to this thing

464
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
you know break newton's thirds newton's

465
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,080
laws

466
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
not neutral break asimov's laws of

467
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
robotics

468
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,640
and we have robocop becoming a total

469
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,039
reality today

470
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,400
um we'll talk about ai

471
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,799
uh in a little bit but ai is kind of

472
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
getting to scary boundaries and we all

473
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,919
know it

474
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,840
even the world leaders are starting to

475
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,000
have debates about you know how

476
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
ai should be used ethically and all that

477
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
i'm going to add to that

478
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
but what i want to illustrate is how did

479
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,559
ai become so

480
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,720
capable right now ai has a long history

481
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
we've always talked about ai since the

482
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,919
80s and

483
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
every time there's a breakthrough we say

484
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
like oh wow machines will start to think

485
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
machines will start to think

486
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
except that every decade it has had a

487
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,039
crest and then it has had like a trough

488
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,080
of disappointment like

489
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
it doesn't it doesn't really stay except

490
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
this time around

491
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,679
right the ai is definitely sticking

492
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,679
so the difference is all the past

493
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,760
decades the ai was trained in

494
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,880
lab with this decade ai

495
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
is trained with real data and that's why

496
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
it's kind of winning

497
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
and where did this real data come from

498
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
right the real data came from

499
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
of course the internet if we talk about

500
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
the evolution of the internet

501
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
right in the 90s it was all the

502
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
beginning of the world wide web

503
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,160
very quickly we started doing business

504
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
on the web we came up with you know web

505
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,919
components and web 2.0 and at this point

506
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,760
in the early 2000s uh society and

507
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,799
technology

508
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,960
both embraced virtualization

509
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
in technology stack the virtualization

510
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,559
led to the evolution of the cloud

511
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,960
but in the social stack virtualization

512
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,160
led to the evolution of social networks

513
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,320
both of these put together will form

514
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,120
cyberspace

515
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
and on top of it there is a lot of data

516
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,520
being generated

517
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,919
from both these technologies in 2007

518
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,880
we started creating processing

519
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,159
environments to collect and process big

520
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,360
data

521
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
and this is still going on if you want

522
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
to see what type of data we have today

523
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,559
there's a statistic the statistic is

524
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,159
slightly old because it was taken in

525
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,880
february 2020 but if you take

526
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,720
all the data on the internet

527
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,240
it totally amounts to 44

528
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
zettabytes of data these are like

529
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
several zeros too many for my brain to

530
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,559
think

531
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,520
but the beauty about all this data is

532
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
that

533
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
90 percent of this data has been created

534
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
only in the past

535
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,880
two years so if you do this

536
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,799
statistic again again at no hat 2022

537
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,960
all this 44 zettabytes will only become

538
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,840
like you know

539
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,000
10 of the data we'll have like 400 and

540
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,640
440 zettabytes

541
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
to deal with this is the speed at which

542
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
the data is is growing

543
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,760
right um but where the hell does all

544
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,039
this data come from

545
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,840
what makes this data this is all our

546
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,720
data

547
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
this is the data you and i are saying

548
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,720
these are photographs these are messages

549
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,320
these are videos

550
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
these are the one billion whatsapp

551
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
messages that indians send

552
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
every day in the morning to one another

553
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
right this is this is

554
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
our data this is our life and what

555
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
happens is this data is

556
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,000
free for us as users

557
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,559
but we're paying for it you know who's

558
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,320
going to store and carry this data for

559
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
free

560
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,720
it's like no one ever right this data is

561
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
actively being used

562
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
in the evolution of artificial

563
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
intelligence

564
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,559
and what we now see as

565
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
machine learning

566
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
the two patterns that are emerging one

567
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,320
is we voluntarily train the machine

568
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,600
one like one click one share at a time

569
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,880
to which point the machine is now very

570
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,919
easily able to recognize photographs

571
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,000
without any additional training

572
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,799
but there are gaps where the machine is

573
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,159
not

574
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,640
trained and then there are sinister

575
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,760
programs like the nefarious google

576
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
recapture

577
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
which will force you to teach the

578
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,320
machine

579
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,440
stuff that it doesn't know and you have

580
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,960
to solve this otherwise you don't get

581
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
these services this is

582
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
this is like you know if there is an

583
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
ugly dark pattern on the internet

584
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
it is recapture and this is forcing you

585
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
to teach the machine

586
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
by crowdsourcing it it's learning really

587
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
really fast

588
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,520
um we take a slight diversion over here

589
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,000
we're going to now talk about the

590
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
evolution of cyber attacks

591
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
we're all very familiar with cyber

592
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
attacks i'm not going to spend too much

593
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,120
time about it

594
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,400
but attacks have also evolved you know

595
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,159
back then when we joined

596
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,799
this whole game of you know offensive

597
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,000
security

598
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
we did it for the laws right we did it

599
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,919
so that we could

600
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,360
demonstrate the weaknesses and if we

601
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
demonstrate the weaknesses we had this

602
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
naive view that the world is going to

603
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,760
fix it

604
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,320
and improve the quality of software but

605
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,440
something somewhere went

606
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,679
horribly wrong if we see the evolution

607
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,240
of

608
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,720
attacks and money you see

609
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
it's all about monetization of cyber

610
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,200
offensive capabilities

611
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,840
right we went from you know making money

612
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
out of ddos

613
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,840
making money out of spear phishing

614
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,080
making money out of ransomware to now

615
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
making money by controlling populations

616
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
and uh yeah let me uh

617
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
let me give you a little money quiz here

618
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,360
you know what do you get if you combine

619
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,720
windows with bitcoin

620
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,039
what you get is ransomware so the

621
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
concept of ransomware is not

622
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,159
is not uh new right

623
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,679
the concept of ransomware has been

624
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,279
around since 2000

625
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,520
this is when of made the first

626
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,799
you know the first kind of thought

627
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,000
discussion like yeah

628
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,559
can we not have a virus which will you

629
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,679
know

630
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,799
lock up things and force people

631
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
to you know take certain types of

632
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
actions the problem was

633
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
the monetization the monetization wasn't

634
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,000
there with the evolution of

635
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,360
cryptocurrency

636
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,440
the monetization problem has been solved

637
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,039
and therefore ransomware all of a sudden

638
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
became reality

639
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,480
right now if we fast forward the tape

640
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,080
from 2002 to 2012 both these pictures

641
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,080
the old this one and

642
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,919
this one were both actually taken in

643
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,520
singapore the same people

644
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
coincidentally got together meet uh

645
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
halvard the grug dave i tell nsk um

646
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,799
if we looked at exploit development in

647
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,799
2012 right

648
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,960
we we don't have any new bugs coming out

649
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,400
to packet storm or

650
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,120
technotronic or whatever it is all of

651
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
exploit development all of offensive

652
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
security had become

653
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,840
commercialized weaponized and heavily

654
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,480
politicized

655
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
now if we you know we spend a lot of

656
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
time talking about the new zero days and

657
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,799
all that

658
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
exclusive days let's look at some old

659
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,880
bugs right here we have

660
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,360
an array of hardware bugs row hammer

661
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,840
spectre and meltdown

662
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,679
right ask yourself this question have we

663
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,120
really fixed them

664
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,200
or you know we're kind of ignoring them

665
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
because they're not a reality

666
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
and some people have issued patches and

667
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
these auditors check

668
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
these compliance boxes you have with

669
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,480
patch tech yeah

670
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,679
tomorrow if a spectre attack happens

671
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,400
you know if it happens in mass we will

672
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,679
not be surprised

673
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
the only reason why these bugs are not

674
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,440
being used is because there are easier

675
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
bugs to use

676
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,799
to compromise people than these advanced

677
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
hardware bugs but tomorrow these may

678
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
very well get used

679
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,440
similarly like 2015 i did a talk about

680
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
stegosport as an exploit

681
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
delivery mechanism it was one of my most

682
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
misunderstood talks ever

683
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,320
i did not know you know what kind of a

684
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,080
 storm something like this could

685
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,559
create

686
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,840
but hey it was fun so stegosport is not

687
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,520
an exploit it's it's basically

688
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,000
delivering any exploit using pixels on

689
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,919
an image using a browser and it just

690
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:52,880
makes use of

691
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,720
certain properties that browsers have

692
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,520
today this type of exploit delivery

693
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,640
mechanism

694
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
is invisible even till date to most of

695
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
your inspecting

696
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,919
and signature based or rule-based

697
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,159
detection capabilities

698
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,640
the thing is has this even gone away no

699
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,559
we're not seeing active use of this but

700
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
this is still around

701
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,360
the truth is that we as an industry have

702
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,159
kind of

703
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,279
trained ourselves in the community to

704
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,640
always look at

705
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,679
infosec as a knee-jerk reaction for

706
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,360
every problem there has to be a patch or

707
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,279
a hot fix or a bug fixing

708
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,919
this is not the case the truth is there

709
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
will be vulnerabilities and we just

710
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
have to learn how to live and

711
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,440
operate within the space the epiphany

712
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
behind this statement came to me in a

713
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
very unique concept

714
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
a concept which i read in an

715
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,760
architecture blog

716
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,080
it was a concept that the author had

717
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,240
termed as nakatomi space

718
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
where bruce willis can go up and down in

719
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,039
the die hard nakatomi tower

720
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,880
at will he could access any point of the

721
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,520
tower without using the intended means

722
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,279
of traversal so he will not use the

723
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,039
stairs not use the elevators he'll use

724
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,039
air ducts air conditioning shafts

725
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,240
fire exits you know elevator chains

726
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,679
to go up and down and do pretty much

727
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,360
anything he wanted

728
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,640
now the truth is nakatomi space very

729
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,000
you know clearly applies to all complex

730
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
systems today

731
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,919
um you cannot have a building without

732
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,440
air ducts you cannot have a building

733
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
without you know

734
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
uh without you know thermal heating

735
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
pipes and all that

736
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
similarly if you take today's complex

737
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,799
software system there will

738
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,080
always be these gaps these pieces of

739
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,520
nakadomi space that

740
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,039
attackers will be able to latch on to

741
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,279
call it encoding data into pixels call

742
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,200
it you know hammering bits and bytes

743
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
in the ram cells call it you know

744
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
predicting timing attacks call it you

745
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
know picking up vibrations

746
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,159
of keystrokes from your monitor screen

747
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,559
by just looking at variations in life

748
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,919
all these attacks which were once

749
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
science fiction have been demonstrated

750
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,960
to be possible today and we do not have

751
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,159
any means

752
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,919
of protecting against them we just have

753
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,960
to live with it

754
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
in terms of defense i want to talk about

755
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,440
you know we go back to 2001 i want to

756
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,320
talk about

757
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,120
what started the whole thought process

758
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,360
of defense but there were very quickly

759
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,279
two timelines

760
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,200
that forked in the year 2001.

761
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
both of these timelines led to a very

762
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
incorrect approach to cyber defense

763
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
because none of us do it we all looked

764
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
at a very

765
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,120
knee-jerk immediate solution type of

766
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
situation like this problem came

767
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,159
immediately therefore the solution has

768
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,840
to come immediately

769
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,039
the first timeline you know led to the

770
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,080
evolution of a new

771
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,240
species which my friend halvar flake

772
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,080
calls the mitigator

773
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
it's a slew of exploit mitigation

774
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
technologies which started and hasn't

775
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,679
stopped yet

776
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,600
just keeps on adding layer and layer and

777
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,679
you know keeps on raising the bar

778
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,679
higher but it's not going to stop the

779
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,159
root cause of the bug

780
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
the second timeline was was was kind of

781
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
a more dangerous narrative

782
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
it all started when microsoft started

783
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,919
getting hit with a lot of worms you know

784
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,480
the code red and nimda and all that

785
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,279
and that gave microsoft a bad name to

786
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,159
which

787
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,960
bill gates wrote his very famous

788
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
trustworthy computing memo

789
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
and gates got the right idea that yeah

790
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,120
if you know if

791
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,520
if people if people cannot use

792
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,799
our computers with trust then it's just

793
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,880
not going to work out well

794
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,840
but gates idea while it's being right

795
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
the approach that the microsoft execs

796
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,520
took was very wrong

797
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,840
so microsoft took a very threatening

798
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,399
approach and this was black hat 2002

799
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,200
i was present at that time in the room

800
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,600
where

801
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
all the big wigs got together that the

802
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,679
found stones and the gardens and the act

803
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,799
stakes and all

804
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,559
all the big big folks got together and

805
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,640
microsoft threatened them like you know

806
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
what if you start if you don't if you

807
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,159
publish your research like this

808
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,440
we're going to stop doing business with

809
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,320
you we're going to cut off your

810
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,679
consulting business

811
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
so everybody said yes sir you know we we

812
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,799
will shut up

813
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,840
no more security research and for those

814
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
first few years as the industry was

815
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,880
growing

816
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,360
the as the cyber security industry was

817
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,600
growing the vendors were really cracking

818
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,159
down hard upon researchers

819
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,880
case in point the harassment of michael

820
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,600
lynn

821
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,000
cisco gate cisco flew in a boatload of

822
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,760
lawyers tore out all his presentation

823
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,640
pages

824
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
and prevented him from presenting at

825
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,320
blackhead 2005.

826
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
he still presented and it was a whole

827
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
 show and whatnot

828
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,039
but uh to fast forward to 2009

829
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,880
it got to a point that researchers were

830
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,159
fed up and they said like

831
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
you know what no more free bugs screw

832
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,919
you guys we are not going to share the

833
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,279
research with you we'll do what it

834
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,240
pleases

835
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
and therefore what happened is this led

836
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,600
to

837
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,360
the rapid growth of the cyber security

838
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,120
black market

839
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,919
the black hat industry started getting a

840
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,679
lot of money

841
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,000
the exploit trading markets were set up

842
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,519
and they're still flourishing

843
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,240
a so-called you know there's been many

844
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
perversions to the whole bug bounty

845
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
scene and bug acquisition or whatnot

846
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
which i'm not going to talk about over

847
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,480
here but what happened is

848
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,039
the research went more towards the black

849
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,720
areas

850
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,360
enterprise started adopting security as

851
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
a risk reduction metric

852
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,320
so you know by products with blinking

853
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,480
lights and dashboards which will reduce

854
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,679
our risks

855
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,360
but all the products that you see on the

856
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,240
shop floor of any exhibition space today

857
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
are only based on rule signatures and

858
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,360
updates

859
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
and sometimes a little bit of machine

860
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,640
learning thrown in

861
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
to get more venture capital but these

862
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
things are very short-lived you know

863
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,080
they they don't

864
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,720
they don't work well they work to stop

865
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,519
the latest attack only for a short time

866
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,919
and then the and then the

867
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,240
the tax pattern and the attack changes

868
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,519
okay so with this let me get into the uh

869
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,039
the main area with this backdrop

870
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,840
we're going to talk about cyberspace the

871
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,880
cyberspace is

872
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
kind of you know unique it's to me it's

873
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,200
like

874
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,320
a planet superimposed on an existing

875
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,360
planet

876
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,880
and as we explore cyber space we as

877
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,720
explorers always want to go to a new

878
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
planet you always want to find out you

879
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,519
know what

880
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,000
what kind of laws of nature and physics

881
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
operate there

882
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,039
well the one conclusion is very clear

883
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,120
that nature's laws do not apply in

884
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,559
cyberspace

885
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,840
and oddly enough neither do your

886
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,519
governments no matter how much the

887
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,360
government say it's regulated

888
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,000
it's still the reckless wild wild west

889
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,519
where if you shoot the sheriff you

890
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,279
become the sheriff

891
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,039
that's that's what it is it's it's a

892
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,679
dark forest out there

893
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,918
we saw in the i we saw in cyberspace

894
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,679
military capabilities growing thanks to

895
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,000
the burgeoning rise of the military

896
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
digital complex

897
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
and who are the power exerters in

898
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,960
today's

899
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
cyberspace military digital complex

900
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,839
these are companies like stratfor which

901
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,320
which you know one of their documents

902
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
published which is available is the

903
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,719
playbook

904
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,199
to isolate the radicals cultivate the

905
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,440
idealists and educate them into being

906
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,679
realists then co-op the realist

907
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,079
this is how to win the war against

908
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,040
grassroots

909
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,199
activists these are stratfor strategies

910
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
these are think tanks

911
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,079
we have the nso group which uh famously

912
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,000
will sell exploits to anybody

913
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
who's bidding who's willing to pay

914
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,040
prices

915
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
and these prices of course are old these

916
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
are 2018 prices you can probably double

917
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,480
them up

918
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,599
to get an estimate of current prices we

919
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,520
have of course the new search engines

920
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
like palantir which the us ice

921
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,640
uses to round up people into cages and

922
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,560
then you have the companies which will

923
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,800
guarantee you wins in an election

924
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,520
simply by changing the thought needle of

925
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
an entire population

926
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,079
uh one person at a time one influencer

927
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,000
at a time

928
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,480
so if we were to kind of you know figure

929
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,599
out

930
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,000
what i as i said like okay what passport

931
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
do i carry on on the face of it i carry

932
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,599
an indian passport

933
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,520
but which of these flags controls me

934
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,119
is a question to us who am i being ruled

935
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,320
by in cyberspace whose

936
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
rules do i have to comply to i will not

937
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,599
call these

938
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,520
flags as governments or republics

939
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,680
because governments and republics

940
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,400
have new process and they have

941
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
governance

942
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
these are just flags set up by board

943
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,720
members

944
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,119
board members governance constitution

945
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,280
whatever you call it is nothing

946
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,320
else but to improve shareholder value

947
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,599
and they'll do what it takes

948
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,880
to bump up that stock price by one point

949
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,119
at a time

950
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,160
if we talk about the you know the three

951
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,640
properties like the laws that the laws

952
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,599
of nature

953
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,599
basically the laws of biology the laws

954
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,760
of physics and laws of chemistry

955
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,000
i present to you my three laws of

956
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,359
cyberspace

957
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,320
number one the law of biology which says

958
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,560
that cells equals pixels

959
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
the cell is the smallest unit of life

960
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
smallest unit of

961
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,480
smallest biological building block we

962
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,119
have a pixel is the smallest biological

963
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,920
the cyber space building block we have

964
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,400
and

965
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
in cyberspace cells and pixels are

966
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,920
indistinguishable

967
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
basically this is why phishing attacks

968
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,119
succeed this is why

969
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,040
we have uh when you enter cyberspace you

970
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,000
have basically

971
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,880
no capability with all these millions of

972
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,119
years of human evolution

973
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,359
all the capabilities that biology gave

974
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,440
you for threat detection

975
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
will fail in cyberspace you go for a

976
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,079
hike in the forest you start hearing a

977
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,839
growling noise

978
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,960
your your brain will react fight or

979
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,280
flight you you know a threat

980
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
instantly and you'll be able to take

981
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,359
defensive action right there

982
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
but here in cyber space you'll be facing

983
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,599
a fishing site and still be interacting

984
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,240
with it

985
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,520
until that bear eats you up completely

986
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
and what is it what is common sense in

987
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,720
reality

988
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,480
is ignorance and virtuality and you

989
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,800
actually see human beings

990
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,680
behave in two completely different ways

991
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
that the same human

992
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,720
is very different in reality

993
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,000
very different in virtuality

994
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,599
you want to know more about how human

995
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,440
behavior is modified

996
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,079
read this paper titled computerization

997
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,320
discretion and freedom by sergey bratis

998
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,640
andersona and their colleagues

999
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,000
the key statement made here is computers

1000
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
modifier behaviors

1001
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,079
related to discretion professional

1002
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,320
autonomy and ultimately

1003
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,599
moral choice um so

1004
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,440
take up some more time over here if you

1005
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,240
folks don't mind

1006
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,839
if we talk about how our lives are

1007
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,079
we are now living in a continuously

1008
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,000
distracted world

1009
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,880
where we have stopped being able to

1010
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,760
recognize the environment around us

1011
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,320
and what is worse is we've stopped being

1012
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,040
able to

1013
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,520
think originally because there is no

1014
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,640
time for thinking

1015
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,440
left you're bombarded with these things

1016
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,359
and your mind goes from one distraction

1017
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,640
to the next

1018
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
only to be distracted by what's coming

1019
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,440
up in the future

1020
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,119
the laws of physics in cyberspace can be

1021
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,000
summed up with this

1022
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,200
one statement a cyberspace distorts a

1023
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,880
reality

1024
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
a concrete case in point i'll give you i

1025
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
was actually flying to see a solar

1026
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,119
eclipse in the southern part of india

1027
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,240
last year

1028
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,160
met a passenger along the way and got

1029
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,000
into conversation and she realized that

1030
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,359
you know we're interested in all these

1031
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,200
celestial phenomenal

1032
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
and she sent me a photograph which you

1033
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
know with this on whatsapp saying

1034
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
this is beautiful and you probably

1035
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,280
appreciate it and the text says that you

1036
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
know this is a day called the moon

1037
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
hunters where there are two suns which

1038
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,839
are emerging

1039
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,160
one is the moon and one is the sun the

1040
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,000
only place i know which has two sons is

1041
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
the planet tatooine and i have not yet

1042
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,119
gone there

1043
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,280
but the person was sharing with this

1044
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,960
with us was not stupid she was actually

1045
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
a very smart person

1046
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,079
the thing is she had no background in

1047
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,960
this area

1048
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,760
and if she wanted to dig the facts it

1049
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,640
was going to be

1050
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,280
a long time consuming process before she

1051
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,079
could process

1052
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,520
the facts and figure out that this is

1053
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,040
fake but instead if you kind of believe

1054
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,319
it you just forward it and spread it

1055
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,960
so yeah you know we we back to the age

1056
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
of miracles

1057
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,960
we had this very short gap in earth's

1058
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,079
history

1059
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
between the time that the camera was

1060
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,880
invented between the time that the

1061
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,640
photograph was invented where the earth

1062
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,160
saw no miracles at all

1063
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
we're now back into the age of miracles

1064
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,079
with full force

1065
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,160
and now we also have an evolution of

1066
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,640
expert to support the miracles right we

1067
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
no longer believe the words of leading

1068
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,760
scientists

1069
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
we believe the words of our aunties on

1070
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
facebook

1071
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,280
who have a louder voice and projection

1072
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,640
than us

1073
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,079
and this kind of leads to

1074
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,640
reality is like you'd think this is a

1075
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
wiley coyote comic because somebody

1076
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,640
builds a rocket and blasts off into

1077
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,800
space to prove that the earth is flat

1078
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
except that this really happened well

1079
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
the earth was not flat but

1080
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,359
mike hughes who built that rocket got

1081
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,160
flat

1082
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,760
because that rocket crashed to the earth

1083
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,000
with him in it it's on youtube for you

1084
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,800
to see

1085
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,240
i mean if it's on the internet it has to

1086
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,800
be true right this is what fueled it

1087
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,400
so uh coming to this you know you

1088
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,079
kind of have this whole

1089
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,440
asymmetry

1090
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,599
where if you are confronted with

1091
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,640


1092
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,480
if you want to refute that it's

1093
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
going to take you 10 times the amount of

1094
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,440
energy to

1095
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,079
counter it but in instead the source

1096
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,680
that is giving you

1097
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,760
will just keep on spewing and

1098
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,359
this is something that we'll all have to

1099
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,280
reckon with in cyberspace

1100
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,800
we don't know the defense yet but we

1101
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
have to figure it out

1102
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
you know and i used to do a thought

1103
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,040
experiment with my audiences

1104
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,240
this i did this in a real talk as well

1105
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,480
like you you see all these pictures in

1106
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
your social network and

1107
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,640
we as human beings have certain

1108
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,560
cognitive biases

1109
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,319
we will tend to passively associate

1110
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,240
each photograph which what type of

1111
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
person they are

1112
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
without us realizing it this is how our

1113
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,119
brains have been trained

1114
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,800
so if i would ask the audience saying

1115
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,880
who do you think is the mountaineer

1116
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
in this whole group and they'd either

1117
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,720
say that it is a lady in in photograph

1118
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,359
one or the the person in photograph five

1119
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,280
or who is you know the professor of

1120
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,960
literature at harvard and they'd

1121
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,640
probably point to

1122
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,359
photograph three or photograph eight a

1123
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,280
journalist would be a toss-up between

1124
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,680
photograph six and photograph seven

1125
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,760
like the new tech pro would be

1126
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,359
photograph number four

1127
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,440
and so on you know our mind is already

1128
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,480
associated

1129
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,200
figured out who these people are without

1130
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
any background just by seeing these

1131
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,079
pictures

1132
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,359
and if any of these people like if

1133
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,359
if you know person number four makes a

1134
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,800
statement about

1135
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,319
the growth in technology you will

1136
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,880
believe it if person number

1137
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,280
three makes a statement about you know

1138
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,960
something in economics you'll believe

1139
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,599
that

1140
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,760
if person number six makes a political

1141
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,599
statement you'll believe them

1142
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,880
but the truth is this

1143
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,240
person does not exist

1144
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,920
these are all fakes these are all

1145
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
generated by neural networks

1146
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,760
if you go to this website and refresh it

1147
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,720
you keep on getting these fake profiles

1148
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,640
and this leads me to the law of

1149
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,359
chemistry in cyber space

1150
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,839
you don't know if you're interacting

1151
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,480
with a carbon based life form

1152
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,680
or a silicon based life form in

1153
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,920
in cyberspace chemistry carbon equals

1154
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,000
silicon they actually ironically

1155
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,920
both have four electrons in their

1156
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,839
outermost orbit they form the same type

1157
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,520
of lattices

1158
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,560
and in reality these two cyber ghosts

1159
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,880
were detected after many years after

1160
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,960
almost two years of interacting with

1161
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,400
public community

1162
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,560
none of these people were real but they

1163
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,920
were still

1164
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,560
being able to influence people in the

1165
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
real world they did believe them

1166
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,920
and take actions as you know what these

1167
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,839
people would

1168
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,720
would direct them to

1169
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,760
so with the rise of super computing

1170
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,040
capabilities with

1171
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,920
big data real time processing and

1172
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,880
everything

1173
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,640
if we want to talk about where we're

1174
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
going next in terms of

1175
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,319
capabilities of ai well here we are

1176
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,240
there used to be this there is this

1177
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,000
story in indian culture

1178
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,560
called the story of these four students

1179
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,319
who all of them were you know

1180
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,200
very bright three of them were brighter

1181
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
than the fourth one

1182
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
and uh these students were you know they

1183
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,079
were trained by their guru

1184
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,760
they got a lot of special powers and all

1185
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,599
that and once they were crossing a

1186
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,200
forest they came across the bones of the

1187
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
dead animal

1188
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,800
one student said you know i can put this

1189
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,960
i can put this skeleton together with my

1190
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,520
powers

1191
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,200
the second guy said i'm smarter than you

1192
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,440
i can put the flesh and bones of the

1193
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,400
skeleton

1194
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,440
on this animal as well i can recreate it

1195
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,280
the third guy says i'm the smartest that

1196
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,760
i can make this animal come back to life

1197
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,440
and the fourth guy said you know you

1198
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,960
people don't know what you're doing you

1199
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,920
like

1200
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,760
you're nuts this is ridiculous what

1201
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,040
you're trying to do

1202
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,520
and these three smart people attacked

1203
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,800
the fourth student

1204
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,160
saying you know you are the dumb best of

1205
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,079
the lord you don't know many things

1206
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,720
why are you stopping us from using our

1207
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,319
knowledge powers

1208
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,920
sure enough the end of the story is

1209
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,839
quite easy to figure out the lion comes

1210
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,680
to life that that one guy

1211
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,319
the dumb guy ran away he was he he lived

1212
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,680
to see another day

1213
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,280
and these three chaps uh kind of

1214
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,720
became breakfast for the newborn land

1215
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,760
so with all these technical innovations

1216
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,000
that

1217
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,079
you know the folks in the fang companies

1218
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,839
are putting together

1219
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,079
and and and us you know we've been

1220
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,240
putting that line together

1221
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,599
one piece one bite one like one

1222
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,000
project at a time the day this line

1223
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,599
comes to life

1224
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,839
run right next steps of evolution i

1225
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,200
don't need to tell you where we're kind

1226
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,920
of heading

1227
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,960
if we go there watch terminator watch

1228
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
the matrix you'll figure out

1229
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,240
that this is no longer science fiction

1230
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,079
few predictions for cyber space in the

1231
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,880
2020s uh

1232
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,520
the dawn of the 3ds deep fakes deception

1233
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,040
campaigns and digital destabilization

1234
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,960
news media's days are over nobody trusts

1235
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,079
the news anyway

1236
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,319
news media end up becoming a victim of

1237
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,680
its own greed

1238
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,920
they took too much money from people who

1239
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,040
who paid them

1240
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,440
and they're no longer reporting accurate

1241
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,960
news and therefore

1242
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,480
all of news media's days are going to be

1243
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,160
just over no matter

1244
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,800
even if there are a few good ones left

1245
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,280
and yeah

1246
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,680
robocop like unmanned armed forces and

1247
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,480
unmanned civilian law enforcement

1248
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,680
are going to become quite real so yeah

1249
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,800
reflect upon

1250
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,359
a very orwellian truth that we if we

1251
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,599
continue down this path

1252
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,720
we may be headed to a point to

1253
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,760
a very orbelian future we're not there

1254
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,240
yet

1255
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,560
we're going there i'm going to start

1256
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,800
summing up in just a little bit

1257
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,839
um if you want to figure out how we got

1258
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,240
there

1259
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,200
right what happened where did we take

1260
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,640
the wrong turn at albuquerque

1261
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,200
this was a statement that haroon told me

1262
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,880
the answer lies in this one statement

1263
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,920
like yeah

1264
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,359
you know uh what's the difference

1265
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,359
between apple and google in the sales

1266
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,640
model

1267
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,920
right apple sells to you

1268
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,079
google sells you so if you're not paying

1269
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,839
for the product

1270
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,960
you are the product that's the statement

1271
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,760
and today users are being monetized

1272
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,480
we're being sold back then by targeting

1273
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
we were being profiled and pinpointed

1274
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,720
and marketed to

1275
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,960
in 2020 the money is not in advertising

1276
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
and marketing anymore the money isn't

1277
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,800
changing your opinion

1278
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,559
you are being influenced if you want to

1279
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,800
pay a company big dollars the company

1280
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,720
will say that hey look i can make all

1281
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,800
these red boxes

1282
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,040
turn to the same green boxes in terms of

1283
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,000
thought patterns i can

1284
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,200
convert all of them from red to green

1285
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,440
and they will be able to influence

1286
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,520
change and correct and track it in real

1287
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,480
time

1288
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,200
so the business now is in assured

1289
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:17,920
outcomes

1290
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,200
and this is happening on large scale at

1291
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,680
this moment

1292
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,040
and as an industry technology or cyber

1293
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,800
security

1294
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,079
we are to blame instead of taking on the

1295
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:32,559
mission

1296
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,359
to protect our users we monetize them

1297
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,079
we did not view upon them as users we

1298
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,240
view up viewed upon them as wallets with

1299
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,040
money

1300
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,440
and we started creating technologies to

1301
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,760
extract more money out of them

1302
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,040
we did not focus upon

1303
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,400
the problem that exists between keyboard

1304
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,200
and chair and these were two tweets from

1305
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,880
the grug and sp

1306
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,599
where they were talking about user

1307
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,079
hardening efforts have barely made any

1308
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:04,800
progress

1309
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
compared to software hardening efforts

1310
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,800
over the years

1311
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,040
and this is true because along with all

1312
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,559
cyber security

1313
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,359
people me included we used to view

1314
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,800
users as not being capable of making the

1315
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
right choice

1316
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,800
and sadly enough we only looked at

1317
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,319
a narrow spectrum of users which were

1318
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,359
incapable and which did stupid things

1319
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,720
but we extrapolated this statement into

1320
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,280
a one

1321
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,480
size fits all we started viewing all

1322
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,280
users

1323
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,880
as being incompetent and capable and

1324
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,119
that was a gross mistake we've made

1325
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,160
a mistake if which we do not correct

1326
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,240
a mistake if we do not restore the trust

1327
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,839
we are not going to be able to make it

1328
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,960
as a healthy cyber cyber space

1329
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,119
population

1330
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,119
now when it comes to restoring trust the

1331
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,599
fundamental mistake you can make

1332
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,920
is to try and correct a technology

1333
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,400
problem using more technology

1334
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,720
there's a theorem that i invented where

1335
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,480
the solution to any problem lies in a

1336
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,160
distinctly different space than the

1337
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,319
problem space itself

1338
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,000
if a problem is brought about by

1339
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,160
excessive use of technology do not try

1340
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,880
to solve it by adding more technology

1341
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,520
if a security vulnerability is created

1342
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,960
by code

1343
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,200
do not add more code to fix it in fact

1344
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,599
you should only subtract code

1345
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,720
but there are you know four areas

1346
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,440
of trust which i want to talk about the

1347
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,000
first one

1348
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,480
is transparency the second one is

1349
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,200
resiliency the third one is matrix and

1350
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
the fourth one is trust

1351
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,000
but transparency we need to really this

1352
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,800
is a classic example of how we

1353
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,920
as cyber security practitioners need to

1354
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,000
think about

1355
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,800
non-technical approaches to create

1356
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,359
security classic example this was

1357
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,760
demonstrated by halvard flay right

1358
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,480
we all know bank statements why does the

1359
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,240
bank need to give us a statement

1360
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,160
well the bank is giving us a statement

1361
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,400
to kind of demonstrate transparency like

1362
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:16,720
this

1363
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,040
is your record here it is at a glance

1364
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,559
and with this you can

1365
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,079
check your accounts you can you know

1366
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,920
check your spending you can reconcile

1367
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,839
the accounts and you can detect any

1368
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:26,720
errors

1369
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,119
if they may have happened and they will

1370
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,119
provide you with an opportunity

1371
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,240
to you know discuss or debate or rectify

1372
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,000
these type of errors

1373
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,720
but with these statements you kind of

1374
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,880
are earning the trust of your bank

1375
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,280
and the trust that transactions are

1376
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,880
being taken care of this is kind of

1377
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,720
giving you that peace of mind that yes

1378
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,839
i can use the bank systems and they're

1379
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:50,960
healthy enough

1380
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,640
for me to do business with halvar's

1381
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,119
discussion he posted it on his blog

1382
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,640
beautiful stuff right

1383
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,720
why cannot we have a bank statement for

1384
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,319
app activity why cannot an

1385
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,920
operating system make visible

1386
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,559
all the stuff that these apps are doing

1387
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,240
and then we as the user

1388
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,040
demand action from facebook and google

1389
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,200
and instagram and whatsapp

1390
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,119
about you know hey why the hell are you

1391
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,880
turning on our mic all the time or why

1392
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,400
the hell are you syncing your contact

1393
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,559
books you know 80 times a day

1394
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,119
what's going on only then will some

1395
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,079
healthy

1396
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,280
stuff come out let us think about

1397
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,440
taking a non-technical concept

1398
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,319
implementing

1399
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,319
technology around this and therefore

1400
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,520
elevating the level of trust

1401
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,400
second of all if you want trust you have

1402
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,319
to trust the user

1403
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,280
and you have to put the user in control

1404
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,839
today all the technology we created

1405
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,040
eliminates users control we

1406
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,200
decide to control it and we push it on

1407
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,480
to the user

1408
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,200
like you know why do you want to make

1409
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,040
rockstar users

1410
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,920
change their passwords once every month

1411
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,760
like this is nonsense you leave them

1412
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,599
alone they are outperforming you

1413
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,839
this by the way is my user maturity

1414
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,280
curve where i

1415
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,200
now regroup users into hopeless

1416
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,520
uninformed proactive and rockstars

1417
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
basically there's nothing you can do

1418
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,800
about hopeless leave them alone screw

1419
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,079
them

1420
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,599
you should not be doing anything about

1421
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,800
the rockstars because they're doing

1422
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,400
better than what you expect

1423
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,960
learn from them proactive users are

1424
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,400
doing as well as you expect

1425
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,240
don't fill with them don't monkey around

1426
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,480
with them but instead what you should do

1427
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,040
is take the uninformed users

1428
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
work upon educating them with one

1429
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,960
concept at a time

1430
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,599
and make the shift pretty soon you'll

1431
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,599
realize you'd shift the curve

1432
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,720
to a very desirable level now there's

1433
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
some examples that are given like one of

1434
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,559
our banking customers decided to

1435
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,160
implement this technology

1436
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,359
based on our suggestion like uh

1437
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,359
you you have your banking atm debit

1438
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,640
cards right

1439
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,040
by default these cards are blocked if

1440
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,640
you want to unblock them you have to

1441
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,079
send an sms

1442
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,000
to unblock the card then you walk up to

1443
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,160
the atm make the transaction

1444
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,920
and then you block the card again with

1445
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
an sms to block and unlock

1446
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,839
this puts the user in control and this

1447
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,160
gives the user assurance that

1448
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,079
you know my card is blocked and i

1449
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,160
control this i can choose when to

1450
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,000
unblock when to block

1451
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,839
and as a bank if you're looking at you

1452
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,839
know which user is making proactive use

1453
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,200
of this technology

1454
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,880
you know they're already on the path to

1455
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,960
maturity start thinking about

1456
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,079
innovative trust generating solutions

1457
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,880
like this there are other applications

1458
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,079
like telegram or

1459
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,640
or gmail or whatsapp they will let you

1460
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,119
see

1461
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,599
where other logins have come from and

1462
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,520
they will even let you log out if they

1463
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,280
detect anything unusual

1464
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,760
you know put the user in control there's

1465
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,000
several examples of that

1466
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,760
the other thing i want to say is please

1467
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,920
it's 20 20 let's do it with passwords

1468
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,200
once and for all

1469
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,359
it's too much time as too much energy

1470
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,040
and too many auditors are making a

1471
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,160
living out of you know

1472
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,079
debating about passwords passwords are

1473
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,480
 we have technologies which you're

1474
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,760
using these days

1475
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,319
like like whatsapp web you simply aim

1476
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,400
your you simply aim your camera

1477
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,440
your phone camera at um

1478
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,839
at the qr code and you will be logged in

1479
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,160
like why cannot we make use

1480
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,359
of cryptography like hotp and totp and

1481
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,040
make it universal it's been

1482
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,960
it's been there tried and tested what's

1483
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,720
keeping us from doing this

1484
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,760
you know we we've got to take ourselves

1485
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,400
out of that box

1486
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,240
so to kind of summarize the four

1487
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,079
elements of security

1488
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,839
this is what we really really need to

1489
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,839
focus on like i said transparency

1490
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,680
metrics resilience and users

1491
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,839
we have come as a cyber security

1492
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,400
industry

1493
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,160
from a culture of resistance we always

1494
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,400
fought with everything we always pushed

1495
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,200
back

1496
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,119
and that's why we also get pushback

1497
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,559
nobody really wants to you know

1498
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,960
implement the things we are saying

1499
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
because we're always tangled

1500
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,480
but the truth is we're fighting with our

1501
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,640
own selves we're fighting with users

1502
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,839
like you and i

1503
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,240
you know if you if you talk about who

1504
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,400
owns cyber security in an organization

1505
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,079
it's a game of passing the buck like

1506
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,599
i don't own it it's not my job it's not

1507
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,520
my job it's not my job

1508
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,000
uh if you look at the technology it's

1509
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,079
all these boxes with blinking lights

1510
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,920
rules signatures updates and patches

1511
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,520
it's all reactive

1512
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,799
we are all including technical debt by

1513
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,400
bringing on the next short-lived

1514
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,839
security product

1515
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,240
and then have to babysit it forever

1516
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,200
whereas it is not

1517
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,400
really being in being effective

1518
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,200
for users we have encumbered our users

1519
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,280
we force them to upgrade we force them

1520
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,280
to change passwords we force them to do

1521
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,760
this force them to do that

1522
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,480
and as cyber security practitioners we

1523
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,359
have become

1524
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:55,119
fear mongers whether we know it or not

1525
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,280
we have become people who are in the

1526
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,680
business of selling fear

1527
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,799
but instead of a culture of resistance

1528
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,359
where we fight with our own selves we

1529
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,880
have to go to a culture of

1530
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,839
resonance where

1531
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,280
we look at

1532
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,559
the same picture you and i we come to a

1533
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,880
same combined vision

1534
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,200
where we all take ownership for the

1535
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,160
security we don't do past the person

1536
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,599
we don't bring on the

1537
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,880
next short-lived security products we

1538
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,640
will build defendable systems

1539
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,359
we will put security and trustworthiness

1540
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:37,760
as

1541
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,720
core software features of what we do

1542
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,960
keeping all the four principles of trust

1543
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,280
in mind

1544
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,680
instead of encumbering our users we will

1545
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,000
empower our users

1546
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,839
and enable them to make the right

1547
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,319
decision

1548
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,880
and instead of selling fear we have to

1549
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,440
enable

1550
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,760
trust so that is my concluding

1551
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,240
concept that i present to you and to do

1552
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,920
all this

1553
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,119
there is no secret ingredient we just

1554
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,119
have to believe in ourselves just like

1555
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,880
what kung fu panda did

1556
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,079
with this i end my discussion

1557

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,880
keynote uh on youtube and uh

1569
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,559
you it you know you've been in the

1570
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,559
industry since ever so i really like the

1571
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,960
photo of 20 years ago with arvada there

1572
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,200
were

1573
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,079
other guys with rocks so i mean like the

1574
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,200
history of

1575
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,680
you know security worldwide so um

1576
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,760
yeah i mean if you are like in

1577
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,520
university i guess you have to watch

1578
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,280
this video once i mean to understand

1579
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,559
where you come from you know we have so

1580
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,559
many students that you know

1581
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,599
they get passion into security but they

1582
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,280
really don't know what's behind you know

1583
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,079
so

1584
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,000
it's the kind of things that they should

1585
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,680
teach in the university so you should

1586
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,960
have like a

1587
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,520
a course dedicated to this or you know

1588
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,480
even in the

1589
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,319
in the company you know if you are a

1590
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,960
company that have some security values

1591
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,400
they should watch your youtube youtube

1592
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,559
i mean yeah this is what i believe right

1593
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:37,680
so if i

1594
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,079
if i would be like a chair of my my own

1595
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,920
company i would go and say okay you guys

1596
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,960
you have to watch

1597
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,559
this video to understand where you come

1598
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,079
from and what's

1599
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,160
what will be in the future so i have

1600
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,319
actually tons of questions but you know

1601
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,760
time is always a problem here um

1602
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,520
so i guess people can reach out to you

1603
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,839
in case they have additional questions

1604
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,319
and should i just go to the room and

1605
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,160
wait for the questions or

1606
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,559

1611
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,480
inside to see if people want to make a

1612
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,599
question right now

1613
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,000
uh otherwise they can easily you know

1614

i hope there will be some personal

1620
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,839
conference

1621
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,880
and uh we can uh we can talk more of all

1622
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,720
the problems you raised i mean

1623
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,119
uh there are solutions but there are so

1624
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,079
many problems

1625
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,040
and we really need people to get

1626
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,720
interested into security to be able to

1627
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,640
address all the concern you raised like

1628
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,520
a

1629
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,240
huge amount of data stored online and of

1630
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,640
the

1631
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,240
password that are still used everywhere

1632
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,760
i mean there are so many

1633
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,200
still open challenges so it's very

1634
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,319
uh you know it's great for us to be in

1635

this

1636
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,400
in this area of of work in my opinion

1637
