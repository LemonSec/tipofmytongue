number of registered users

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
event page like uh like

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,879
ten days ago or two weeks ago and uh

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,559

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
like uh register like 699 plus two

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,760

from you guys because again what we do

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,079
is just as a volunteer effort

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
so nobody is paying us in what we're

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,759
doing and uh

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
so for us you know having like seeing

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,439
actually people that

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,560
give us feedback even in donation is uh

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
is very much appreciated uh so we start

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
some stats from today

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
so we got uh uh 34

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
uh countries involved in uh in this

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,439
event what does that mean it means we

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,159
have

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
we had like more than uh 40 different

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,840
nationalities

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
participating in the live stream of

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
knowhead uh which was a good

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,000
positive side effect of uh going uh

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
virtual because if you have a physical

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
conference way more difficult to travel

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
you might have problems with visa for

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,319
example

61
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
or you know if you're a student you kind

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
of pay for flight and so on and so forth

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
well actually you know the fat that we

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
go over uh internet it makes

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,120
it easier you know uh so it's a it was a

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
good opportunity for having

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,599
