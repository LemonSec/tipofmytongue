1
00:00:23,970 --> 00:02:05,870
security security security of the world
the deal see you know about making it

2
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:12,930
like really about getting to the market
fast about you know finding resources

3
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,799
old so it's less fun definitely it's
less fun compared to what it was two

4
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:25,939
years ago this application security the
different because presentation here on

5
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,970
this forum about security automation
everybody's talking about different

6
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,609
things and our presentation is not an
exception I hope

7
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:47,460
by covering you can utilize to make the
security of more but it's still very

8
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:59,950
much a not it's not a lot of room great
room for inventions this is what we're

9
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:09,679
trying to do so as to how security was
handled like five ten years ago I think

10
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:18,180
it's important because I talked to many
security for so many years and i think

11
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,459
that what we are doing is not very
common I've seen like many companies

12
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:30,730
which are still reasons or alter the
security which doesn't allow them to be

13
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:38,959
very well I hope our presentation will
help you to understand what needs to be

14
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,670
change to become more to address
security concerns quicker to catch up

15
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,970
with all those contemporary as DLC
villages and that's why I just want to

16
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:59,519
work very quickly what we had in the
past and how it responded to the

17
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:09,650
villages so by seven years ago as DLC
process was very much a wonderful so you

18
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,850
had also slide gateways business
requirements

19
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:23,760
architecture design coding testing is
also and it was just a process to this

20
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:32,729
model because it was president I'm
always knew what you can adjust your

21
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:41,560
security processes to need development
processes so at that time

22
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:50,310
luxury security assessments and it
started his visit in developing a

23
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,650
business deals on site and getting
everyone on board would be like

24
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:03,570
developers database administrators
operations businesspeople everyone and

25
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:13,180
resources available we could sit down
and talk about security but the first

26
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,110
step would be to understand how the
system is built after we knew that we

27
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:25,080
would go to the next step we will create
a very formal and informal means that

28
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:34,010
the user's guide of how many people so
this is actually

29
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:41,180
alleges that would help you to assign
preschool pseudo-scientific well as a

30
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:50,120
quality white pseudo-scientific because
all these categories there you know not

31
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:59,710
just the whole set so you can do that if
you want to do you like a lot of time

32
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,810
trying to understand what your risk
categories or you just like simply use

33
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:15,419
just by using your experience by
analyzing the business environment and

34
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:26,700
the availability of so so eventually be
good because this is another one was

35
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:41,250
pride of your findings reported a
broader appropriately and i think is

36
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,830
better and it's not completely dead and
I know some security professional still

37
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,609
use it but still in my view it's like to
abstract because when you have a lot to

38
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,009
do with it it's very difficult

39
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,949
to find the right category the second
problem is that sometimes when you have

40
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,319
one but two defeats to almost all
categories for example like if you think

41
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:12,449
about the password policies and then the
question is what is the point so I went

42
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:22,460
really well and instead of the switch
because it's usually generated

43
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:32,109
automatically by most importantly they
reflect the eligible because they're

44
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:43,210
talking about like very specific
problems like I think they were trying

45
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,539
to get all the risks which are coming
from what their abilities so we took

46
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,110
into consideration that's cool

47
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:00,249
xxx consideration controlling as well so
you can implement very good control so

48
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:08,189
you might have no controls so if your
controls good result number 540

49
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:15,680
your day of school and other way around
if you're controlling it is you know the

50
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:26,769
residual school behind even if you're so
we were trying like to put everything

51
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,769
and presented to our executives

52
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:42,060
X which is coming from all the abilities
of useful for applications on X Y you

53
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,040
see index which is coming from the
source evaluation of security controls

54
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:55,620
that have already implemented so be on
the top left is good on the right but

55
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:05,730
not very well everybody understood it so
I like our have to be done because I was

56
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,690
ready for them

57
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:13,140
we will proceed with operation
politician tasted the time was more like

58
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,930
a research note but like a something
like that american regime really lot of

59
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:28,829
automated then expand US was thinking
about the most handsome like inferior

60
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,960
compared to manual testing and we were
using just sure that your name where the

61
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,930
security bugs are concentrated when we
found this component and we will go

62
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,719
deeply inside and this is like an
example very good when you're tired of

63
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,470
this time we were trying to host about
how random random number generator was

64
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:57,010
at a time when used webster up you can
see from this picture but it is

65
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,870
definitely a part of its not random so
when they open the court to rate it will

66
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,370
I clearly identified a very good problem
so I just like to tell you that like it

67
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,120
was like a very interesting research
going to work rather than some automatic

68
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,330
skeleton so just to summarize our
approach we still like we're using all

69
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:32,120
this talk media files communications
results to developers we also very nice

70
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:42,220
executives after this is done we will go
to the second stage which is actually

71
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,800
what it was developed for mediation
process which formerly was called him I

72
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,479
can select a former colleagues know what
it means is actually doing it that you

73
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,040
found it now you're responsible to fix
it and then you have liked him like

74
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,900
business when you talk to you start
talking to their marriages of course

75
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,939
it's not a priority for your trying to
escalate doesn't work well and you don't

76
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,400
look nice and so on so forth so it was
like very difficult to do that

77
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:23,080
security of their boards reported
escalated issues to city or so it was

78
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,980
somebody else and then what happened

79
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:35,140
big man what it means hold us jill is
the Aussie dollar has been applied to

80
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:44,480
many projects projects flying over our
head was being invited over to the

81
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,240
suspects and so what's so this is like
we're tired when they realize because

82
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,810
now it's like a very good time to talk
about what is our products that we

83
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:02,930
support now I mentioned that her idea
cloud solution that allows any idea

84
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,560
devices to connect of starters medium
data so if you think about like millions

85
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,459
of unsuspecting daters you would realize
that it's a lot of the Soviet dictator

86
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:19,540
but most importantly it's all based so
you can use a title sales data and you

87
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:29,490
can use API to get the musée d'art to
mind you do you want to have your

88
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:45,610
applications built on top of his eyes
but there really is a simple abductions

89
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,890
building will take it like two weeks so
we have a very strict process how it

90
00:12:52,890 --> 00:13:03,860
works in this process is a key element
of any good if you shouldn't people who

91
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,550
actually what programmers create a lot
of tests to cover open the nations of

92
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,760
parameters the eyes of changes happening
lately I they would immediately create a

93
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,380
test would have liked regression test
suite no

94
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:26,240
production release would go to
production until it's ok to do so it's

95
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,670
very important to understand

96
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:34,640
our group will show you later hold
utilizes process to do a better security

97
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:46,170
so as I said we had no choice to change
our approach to security problem

98
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:56,630
waterfall to which are coming from the
realities of those described so they

99
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,689
don't have to four weeks for security
purposes anymore

100
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:08,310
forces went to a nurse and nobody
understood talked about was also tried

101
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:18,920
to secure it was simply impossible to
have the store for days

102
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,640
interviews to get all those people on
board again because like a real job and

103
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,130
the second one is because people like
everywhere it's the old times as

104
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,540
possible

105
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,329
nobody gives us environment for purely
for security-based it anymore so we had

106
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,060
to figure out how to work with create to
make sure that we don't interfere with

107
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,810
the judge finally like the most
important things we would need to

108
00:14:50,810 --> 00:15:00,760
understand that we need to work to make
sure that the most important security

109
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:09,110
box there are some challenges which are
related to our products probably genetic

110
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:17,870
and coming from waste products so
obvious of course you cannot chill this

111
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:24,000
caller here is your elbows kinda goes by
the time I get there is no such a single

112
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,120
spiral even if scholar smart enough to
understand where parameters tries to do

113
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,580
some kind of injections

114
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,570
it's still not available tests because
it probably will inject something which

115
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,400
is relevant to security but it doesn't
understand the business would write

116
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,850
because it'll set some parameters like
you will be getting responses like 400

117
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:55,450
but they like your people there's no
product reviews this point are you

118
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:08,560
getting 404 if you put some rest houses
entities and coated with some members of

119
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
the right one

120
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,620
it means that like all your security
payload is not going to the publication

121
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:26,150
it will be filtered out somewhere like
one period so you're not really so you

122
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:32,270
can have liked to have a problem of
course that more people will security

123
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,710
let us write called security code for
each and every disgrace that we have

124
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:42,040
each other weekend edition of parameters
but we don't have too many people I

125
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,310
would usually from 224 people and
securities of the other projects

126
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:56,670
actually out is to utilize their wells
of greatest which all parameters in

127
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,160
place this parameters have a very good
semantics from business plan to you so

128
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,040
it's not a garbage whatever they do make
sense so our task would be just to

129
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,159
utilize all this traffic and to see what
kind of security problems you may find

130
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,690
aggravating factors about security
question if you compare this to a

131
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:29,910
deterministic rate application security
operation in August her false positives

132
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:37,120
I will show them to developers will be
very happy about it

133
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:51,580
ability is real you still because
sometimes more often than not

134
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:58,919
Dynamics Canada Medusa's job well so you
need to explain to everyone with the

135
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:06,500
Securities and what to do about this job
of explaining vulnerability and

136
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:14,360
remediation plan it's especially when
you have a lot of young engineers who

137
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,250
are not for me to the security at all so
taken all these factors into

138
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:28,070
consideration was holding a solution we
need some kind of framework where they

139
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,300
can take our imports security-related
input from different sources

140
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:42,740
important to one place and lowers the
other important things to do than by

141
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,900
told you about like I will process goes
to production so to make sure that our

142
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:55,730
test runs before to make sure that it's
OK from security point of view and of

143
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:02,810
course it should allow when you listed
as well because as I mentioned before we

144
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,270
do not completely trust so it's time
when we have a new feature new product

145
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:15,720
we still need to do our solution looks
like so decided to use our security desk

146
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,840
boat as you probably know my signal data
bodies were all found the little store

147
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,340
and situated on some development

148
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:36,360
that excites the new group has noticed
our welcome to the official contributors

149
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,439
listed what we actually did some
improvements how the data is presented

150
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,230
to make it a few occasions to make sure
that we found something interesting like

151
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,010
media hype already with you go to our
email immediately and we don't have to

152
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:01,510
wait until somebody actually brings up
your eyes on the left side you actually

153
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:10,640
see all sources of Honor abilities of
course actually equally important to us

154
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,090
will show how to work this new piece
features and product as I mentioned we

155
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,379
use them when your test but the results
are generated XML format which is

156
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,480
understood by six so we can easily
handle them and we are some custom tools

157
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,409
for example this girl that I'm going to
talk about that allows to the level of

158
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:43,740
consideration and automation then on the
right side so it means generate PDF

159
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,039
documents anymore

160
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,419
reviewing the results of its review the
civility and export them into general

161
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:59,270
security artists to the top of the
people who do all that after this is

162
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,629
done

163
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,220
created for the webstream they have any
questions you can always come to us and

164
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:14,370
we will work together so this is like a
very high level how it works now

165
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,299
something is going to provide more
details and after that I'll show you how

166
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,639
to use take advantage of aggression

167
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:34,169
I work at the security architect in the
Internet of Things group within Samsung

168
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:41,220
my primary job is basically to make sure
or cloud-based platform is secure before

169
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,330
I proceed to far I want to ask you all
of you how many of you are already using

170
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:56,399
some form of security organization
played with it so I know each one will

171
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:05,719
be having a different type of haitian so
I'm going to talk about is security in

172
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,629
your environment without with very
minimum investment basically I'm going

173
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:18,139
to open source but it can be done but
we're idea of

174
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:29,809
as well so these are the tools that work
with the core dashboard that will be

175
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,119
using that used to consolidate all the
scans that are done by the security

176
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,428
automation will be using trade pics and
it does all kinds of scanners and I'm

177
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:45,409
sure you'll find something that you use
in your at one so I'm going to be

178
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:53,889
talking about using open source will use
trade pics

179
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:05,299
job scheduler and myself so I'm just
going to give you just to get you

180
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:11,610
started 36 available for a download of
limbs and these this deck will be

181
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:21,709
available for you to use your privilege
so anything i mean so you install the

182
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,149
trade pics and one stretch picked it up
and running you know you want to use

183
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:32,439
that password so on the next step is
basically installs up so I'm going to

184
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,440
use only have as

185
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,550
as our primary scanner the reason being
you know it's very easily available is

186
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,690
very easy to configure and we will run
it in two more than one is headless

187
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:58,830
small and other one is the you are so
basically and downloaded installed in

188
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:07,870
your AWS RVM environment and also use
installed on your laptop or whatever the

189
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:15,780
first one was for using in hella small
the UI is used for creating is Asian

190
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:22,320
applications have a login credentials
you want to make sure what is a logical

191
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,060
condition what is Logan condition and
it's very easy to configure there are

192
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,919
that has one idea of YouTube videos
available for configuring these sessions

193
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:38,890
so you could use and configure your job
so the ultimate objective of this

194
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:44,310
ratings are you are using that is to
create the session which you will upload

195
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:54,850
to your UNIX server so that it can run
the scans at night midnight and fired up

196
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:03,000
and you know so we'll talk more briefly
those things so configuring scans for

197
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,540
web applications so I just briefly
talked about whether you have

198
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:15,190
applications are you could create used
the same approach for the scans so

199
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,370
transfixed needs very insulted you will
get you can generate your own API key

200
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:29,360
that's what this is basically yourself
and your URL so I'm using it on my

201
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:40,860
laptop in a local host environments will
be next what is you just create a shell

202
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,459
script file to run the scan the first
part

203
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:54,260
small but although he does is basically
it continues gangs your application uses

204
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,510
the session file which you have
applauded from your laptop and create an

205
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:11,840
XML file so this so that each and every
show filers you will also create where

206
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,408
are your future obligations will be you
can scan together and these files will

207
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:23,710
be used for any condiments cancer if you
run one runs can manually you could just

208
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,870
go to the ground job scheduler a you
could use any web is crime job scheduler

209
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,860
where you can see on-demand scan or you
can schedule it to run at midnight to

210
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:41,490
all those things are easier so what I'm
going to do is going to briefly devote

211
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,049
the security automation that configured
on my laptop here

212
00:27:28,140 --> 00:28:22,680
night and so on my laptop and create can
upload the file to trade pics and it

213
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:33,970
creates its gas it normalizes your XML
file and upload the shows the results in

214
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,590
an ounce nice graphical format as well
as he also said you alert email alert do

215
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:48,159
these alerts will be you go to security
professionals like you guys and not

216
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,880
because review it

217
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,770
objective is any major issues in the
major media is iris look at it you would

218
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,820
see them first

219
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,060
you would receive emails would look at
them immediately and the way it is

220
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,060
basically

221
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:53,330
something like this in the issue 202
yards and it will have the state fix

222
00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:01,070
will include all the necessary
information so along with the Euro so

223
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:08,678
that's one way to other things that you
can do is good also marked this as a

224
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:16,210
false positive that you know that are
not real issues because of the two that

225
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:23,809
you use market do you could set up
e-mail alerts and so on so let's go back

226
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,809
to our presentation and

227
00:30:36,039 --> 00:31:19,239
so

228
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:45,590
and application ideas which give you the
next step is to start in a headless born

229
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,158
in previous case for web applications
use command line and you know one step

230
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,429
everything was here it's a multiple
steps for QA regression you'll start

231
00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:09,460
that next step is configure and start to
integration now you would have to work

232
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:16,779
with little bit on the UN aggression
before you actually how to run the QA

233
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:22,099
regression yourself fully on your own
and obviously there are certain things

234
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:27,609
that you may have to do on your computer
or whatever and one run it without doing

235
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:34,379
anything securities litigation and then
modify some of the script configuration

236
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:44,879
file properties file to use a proxy
started in the previous step that proxy

237
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,490
and letting our environment so

238
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:58,140
we have the command and we just don't
use the next one is foreign fire is save

239
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,200
your security settings you would create
the XML file at the end of your

240
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:11,440
aggression as an XML and in the next
step up Laura 230 X so all these steps

241
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,990
and you could run the fewer aggression
on demand or if you want to run it at

242
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,490
midnight and so on so this is a separate
the Great Depression than what the QA is

243
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,400
already doing led the way to their own
aggression and they can use their own

244
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:34,580
proxy a proxy for security purposes you
would do that the proxy and then so on

245
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:42,199
all this can be a script so I'm going to
go back to all the people

246
00:33:48,480 --> 00:34:04,640
so this is a perfect example you know
how you can utilize resources to

247
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,290
leverage about the security so I said
like it was like medical things that we

248
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:13,550
implemented actually what if I didn't
see anyone else is doing that sunday was

249
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:35,109
talking how we can do it like a dude
reportedly told this girl and features

250
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:43,350
that allows your proposal level
especially when you have your security

251
00:34:43,350 --> 00:35:03,299
system so allows you to do it just to
the same scale to do it all but most

252
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:11,460
importantly of course you can use it in
headless mode at the same time you can

253
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:24,510
both by providing those related to go up
as well actually would be surprised if

254
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:34,950
you print out all parameters which are
poorly documented and better

255
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,330
configuration if you understand what
they actually do so

256
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:57,578
so this is like how configuration file
for looks like they would understand

257
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:08,810
what it means that she doesn't receive
any requests since when you circuits

258
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:16,380
assembled opinionated and reports will
be generated his issues we're all issues

259
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,230
distorts the director Elaine

260
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:27,010
the next one is saying that I want to
round up in proximity to the next one is

261
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:34,920
making you can see URL prices which are
followed by website that I'm going to

262
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:46,819
URL pressure which is followed by a
reporter where the results in Google

263
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:55,730
results generated and stored in XML file
XML and for white house security that

264
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:06,810
the results will be stored in WH the XML
file is not what you doing so the next

265
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,720
time and everything else will go to
report its gonna figure out why it's

266
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,089
important even if you look at the
results and sweat because you really

267
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:24,099
responding to belong to that I like you
want to have some kind of relation to

268
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:31,660
make sure that you separate application
and application usually URLs that you

269
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,980
might want to use their products to
other parameters are important as well

270
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:43,470
you will see that I hope you can or you
for low-level civility flex I installed

271
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,689
them to false here just for the purposes
of this data in real life of course it

272
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,309
would be too

273
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:59,969
positive you don't want to pay attention
to lower section is built what I'm

274
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:11,349
saying here is working again like we
don't want sure interception store

275
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:20,309
requests the last one is very important
sources like when I said that her skills

276
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:26,049
as you can see it actually what I wanted
to do it here I want to change the port

277
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:32,229
of each dollar pejorative do it and you
know that's what I wanted to share with

278
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:37,680
AT&T so it has a bunch of fuels of I
don't understand what if I change this

279
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:53,538
one it intellectually stuff like how
this is what I'm going to do my coworker

280
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,109
regression test the time he was talking
about I just built to use a couple of

281
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:00,109
government will be sending a request

282
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:10,569
at the same time the proximal during all
those products and it will try to find

283
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,599
all the regulators voted

284
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:37,540
connection refused because he was not
ready to start the process so it will

285
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:47,520
take some time because java games are
words always get started so now that US

286
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,850
and the UK you can see that some work
school issues have been treated right

287
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,020
away we'll take a closer look

288
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,300
20 minutes timeout on Google as well

289
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:14,870
it while some issues as well as will
never do it was used by the application

290
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:23,170
and doesn't have a secure full except so
curious what you consider the latest

291
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,170
Google site implementation

292
00:40:50,099 --> 00:41:03,470
reports the Google XML

293
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:25,430
something presumably found some medium
vulnerability at Whitehead security

294
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:30,750
website at all or most likely thought I
did some research I just like to

295
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:40,460
demonstrated that all this tool to
generate so it seemed like medium like I

296
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:48,619
don't want to go to so needless to say
that all the files are compatible with

297
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:55,020
Statik Selektah can easily do another
job that will take us XML file uploading

298
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:03,670
pics probably important to us what you
want to know how to transform the

299
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:13,700
security of two operational security so
instead I was a full two days early

300
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:20,379
meetings as many people in the world who
participate in discussions collaboration

301
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:36,030
and so it works very well again just
like jizz like brats tried lots of

302
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:41,920
others like we don't use them anymore
instead of just like writing

303
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,030
recommendation and children from
architecture design discussion below the

304
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:53,240
review which was kind of reputation well
with everybody understands stride is

305
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,240
generated automatically solution

306
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,840
instead of doing everything we do
whether selective interest in for the

307
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,850
area saw the biggest impressed with us

308
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:15,020
new features nope new product especially
if they're related to security expensive

309
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:23,800
security this is a good because again
we're on our budget is limited by the

310
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:32,900
security line you so you almost

311
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:43,439
is a good solution docs and PDFs ago on
instead of just exporting terrorism 2006

312
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:51,570
there is no way you like my new role to
summarize it like even shorter
