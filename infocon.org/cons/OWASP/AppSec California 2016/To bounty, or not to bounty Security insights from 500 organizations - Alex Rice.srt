1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:26,909
going into a network rollout a long
stint as a security research here most

2
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,430
recent websites before that and then
ended up as one of the early application

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,309
security employees at Facebook and what
are the

4
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,980
when I arrived at Facebook I had already
had a pretty miserable set of

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,540
experiences with responsible disclosure
and vulnerability coordination over the

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,030
course of my career before that and one
of the first things that I helped set up

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,909
a Facebook was a formalization of a
responsible disclosure program which was

8
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:54,350
just coming out and saying we're not
going to be jerks to security

9
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,559
researchers we want to work with you
probably would like to have a process in

10
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,030
place for measuring that we ran which is
responsible disclosure program for three

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,869
or four years before we kind of naively
decided to start offering bounties we

12
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,110
were the second web property on the
Internet to start paying cash to

13
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,820
researchers and it was pretty
overwhelming we feel pretty confident

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,229
going into it hadn't had too many
problems at work wrapping up we thought

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,930
we were doing our jobs pretty well we
announced cash bounties under the night

16
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,980
before death kind Friday and receive
more vulnerabilities in the next 48

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,420
hours then the teams all of our tooling
in internal been tested found over the

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,580
last year we stayed very busy with a
very humbling experience but it started

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,979
thinking a lot about how we
operationalize are responsible

20
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,670
disclosure program and then later the
bug bounty program fast forward a few

21
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,340
years from that and I founded and now
run the product engineering teams for a

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,320
company called hacker one which as the
top of this talk to give a brief

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,089
interview of what hacker when does and
how some of the metrics are talking

24
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,849
about the day work were collected our
core use case after one is to enable a

25
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,149
security yet we call this vulnerability
coordination and hacker one at its core

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,120
is availability coordination platform
there's a lot of different names for

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,330
this in the industry you just heard me
using responsible disclosure we called

28
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,550
the program at at Facebook I'm still a
little partial that term even though

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,850
there

30
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,120
very good reasons not to use emotionally
labeled descriptors for what we're

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,440
talking about here or coming here called
vulnerabilities Gordon coordination

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,370
school year but we simply refer to it as
security at this is as simple as setting

33
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,400
up security at your company dot com and
having a clear defined process for

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,760
researchers to contact you with pencil
vulnerabilities identified we hold about

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,760
500 of these ongoing programs now at
this point

36
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,680
little over two thousand individual
hackers have disclosed vulnerabilities

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,930
to our customers through this process
and there's been over 17,000 of this

38
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,430
unique vulnerabilities identified in
those 500 companies connected into this

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,870
I need to do a little bit of a caveat
here in this is a point that I like to

40
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,600
hit on pretty regularly we are simply a
platform our customers do not grant

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,500
access to their vulnerability
information

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,860
none of what we look at and analyzes
content were strictly looking at

43
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,250
transaction data here the state to bug
reports and helping measure how that

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,080
relates gets everything else the
programs that are being run on how can

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,960
one are being run by the customers and
companies that offer those programs it's

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,980
a direct relationship with with the
researchers and finally we're coming up

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,119
in about six million dollars in bounties
paid by our customers back to the

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,060
security research community and it's
important to note that a bug bounty is

49
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,440
optional and discretionary not all of
our customers do it a huge chunk of them

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,859
do not and it's helpful to think about
why those companies do or do not choose

51
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,930
to offer incentives in particular areas
which brings us to the topic to talk

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,810
about today is the question that I hope
you have a little bit easier time

53
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,390
answering at at the end of this I want
to give it a little bit about the

54
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,380
audience who I think this would be more
useful to specifically talking to folks

55
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,530
who are running some type of product or
service that is externally accessible

56
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,880
over the Internet or in some ways
physical possession the areas of your

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,219
security infrastructure that are not
internet accessible or

58
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,340
directly exposed to the outside are
probably not if you're not responsible

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,320
for any infrastructure like that you
probably aren't asking yourself this

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,230
question

61
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,640
additionally if you're already running
about money program neither to answer

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,419
this question and you're probably not
going to get a lot of talk sorry but

63
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,500
that there's a lot more than we can talk
about about but many programs I would

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,400
assume here that people are generally
familiar with the concept and we're

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,909
going to specifically focus on just that
initial question of do I offer

66
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,200
incentives in this particular area
yesterday and we're defining about here

67
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,890
as a monetary incentive offered in
exchange for mobility report there are a

68
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,400
number of different ways you can get an
answer his question there is no simple

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,140
one surefire path of this not all
technology stacks are created equal

70
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,539
this is not one size fits all as a
little bit of analysis then used to go

71
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,810
into whether or not this makes sense and
it's a little bit subjective at the end

72
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,700
of it but there's two methods that I
found work the best there's other ones

73
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,810
that we can talk about them know that
I'm talking about just these two the

74
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,920
first one is look at the data that's
coming out of your security program

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,740
hopefully you've received the
vulnerability apart from somebody in the

76
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,270
past and what that process looks like
you should be measuring how that is

77
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,890
going and you will learn a tremendous
amount from that it's kind of nice thats

78
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,570
Marcus warmed us up with metrics and
stats this morning because I'm going to

79
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,180
be reiterating that this the best way to
answer the question is to get a very

80
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,030
tight control over the metric and snacks
that are being generated by your

81
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,080
security program particularly those
vulnerabilities are coming from the

82
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,740
outside one of the first dimensions that
is critical for all of us to pay

83
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,330
attention to is around vulnerabilities
there is a lot of ways to slice this we

84
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,159
can talk a little bit later about how
hacker once licenses for the customers

85
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,490
that are there but you don't need a
platform like that to be able to start

86
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,370
answering this question for yourself
it's important to start measuring the

87
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,500
total number of vulnerabilities that are
coming in particular source we're gonna

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,890
just be talking about those external
vulnerabilities here but it was found

89
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,159
that the outside but your team and then
breaking them down by type

90
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,520
severity is equally relevant and for
your particular area you will know your

91
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,570
application far better than that I ever
will perform well and there's going to

92
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,020
be additional metrics here that will
point towards whether or not the overall

93
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,229
health of your own abilities are looking
and the important thing to ask when

94
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:09,660
you're asking so should you bernie is is
this trending down you look at your own

95
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,170
abilities for a period previous period
of time for a particular application or

96
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:20,050
service a specific product or service
and it's going up if you open up your

97
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,240
polish colors dashboard every month and
you look at these quarter and there's

98
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,950
more and more red reasonable time you do
not want a bounty program yet for that

99
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,880
you need in STL and a lot more
investment in your SQL before you're

100
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,460
ready to start looking at a product or
service hopefully not everything in your

101
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,760
environment looks like this there's
going to be areas that are better off in

102
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,120
Warsaw and abounding is not one size
fits all across the organization but you

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,580
want to try to narrow it down to those
specific areas where your

104
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,490
vulnerabilities have trending down
you're looking for places where all your

105
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,000
existing security tooling and automation
and investment in the past has started

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,180
to produce diminishing returns you had
amazing results from a penetration tests

107
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,740
the first time you run one ten years ago
and you're looking at in the past I'm

108
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,419
and it started to turn down a bit to the
point where you're you're not running

109
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,440
them as aggressively in that particular
area

110
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,600
secondly we're talking about external
vulnerability reports that the next

111
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,990
dimension that we like to pay attention
to his attackers a security researchers

112
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:28,780
lenders the outside wherever it is have
some metric of how many vulnerabilities

113
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,169
have been reported to us or we learned
about through somebody that was another

114
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,520
payrolls rose another set of most
importantly tracking just the total

115
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,780
number the total number of new
individuals for purple color time period

116
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,770
if you look at the how many times we
contact for the very first time by an

117
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,540
individual per quarter

118
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,050
most importantly the number of repeat
hackers that are coming back this is the

119
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,859
sole metric that mr starr said I'm src
optimize their process for in measuring

120
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,320
whether or not the AM SOC security

121
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,310
was effective they wanted to pay
attention to how many one hit wonders

122
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,550
how many times it somebody send us a
vulnerability and then disappear never

123
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,760
be heard from again and by focusing on
that one single metric and optimizing

124
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,660
for that they made tremendous strides in
the AM src and started to identify areas

125
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,270
where they need to improve upon their
their overall process but should you ask

126
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,980
yourself that question you're looking
for

127
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,490
metrics here that are trending down you
want to have heard from less hackers

128
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,810
this quarter when you heard from last
quarter you want to particularly pay

129
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,459
attention to the ones that are reporting
high critical vulnerabilities if you

130
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,420
happen to have a product or service
where you are getting a consistent

131
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,349
regular number of hiring critical
vulnerabilities from the researchers

132
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,890
without giving them any type of
incentives it's probably not an ideal

133
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,880
candidate for let's go back to that area
and again we're looking for particular

134
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,950
products and services not necessarily
the entire third and we're talking about

135
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,200
there's two parties involved here you
need to have a very good handle on what

136
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,600
your response efficiency looks like this
is gonna be defined differently at every

137
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,550
single organization and hopefully you
already have some type of response

138
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,660
measure how long does it take us to fix
ex the one that we pay attention to it

139
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,939
after one are the mean time to respond
to me time to triage and the mean time

140
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,920
to resolve the incident is a very
subjective area there's no clean answer

141
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,610
for what this should look like for
everybody but you should ask yourself

142
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,640
are you happy with these metrics if you
look at them and you're like a pretty

143
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,069
good about that one

144
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,430
do not feel good about that one one way
to think about that is how many of those

145
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,979
vulnerabilities took longer than 10 days
to resolve and and is going to be

146
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,270
different for every single product line
there are products we're perfectly

147
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,970
reasonable value for and is a hundred
and eighty days and there are product

148
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,020
lines were reasonable value for N is 18
hours and you don't know the difference

149
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,000
in to you have started to measure your
baseline trying to get over time

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,840
are paying attention to how long should
it take us to resolve here and the

151
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,340
litmus test that I like to use for this
is if you said an internal SLA for it we

152
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,840
want to resolve all vulnerabilities in
acts in an hours would you be

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,420
comfortable talking about it publicly is
it would be proud about it would feel

154
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,000
good would it be something that you'd be
comfortable talking about it not

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,590
necessarily that you have to it's just
that's the frame of mind that I like to

156
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,540
get in when trying to assess is it do we
have a responsibility here that were

157
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:45,579
happy with the way we purchased one is
based on that realization that this

158
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,810
isn't one size fits all there are many
different types of products and services

159
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,130
out there that come from a number of
different circumstances that we can't

160
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,439
possibly come from our mistakes we
devise a success index that measures key

161
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,110
aspects of security a performance across
a number of different mentions but most

162
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,460
importantly the technique that we use
benchmarks trends here against all the

163
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,510
other organizations on on the platform
so we're not trying to answer this why

164
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,220
is this a good metric for you you're the
only person who can answer that question

165
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,930
will certainly show you their all the
raw data and encourage you to click the

166
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,400
raw data but the one that we highlight
the most is how does this compare to

167
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,770
other organizations that look like you
to publicly available data or get it to

168
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,790
develop on the platform is one of the
most objective ways of identifying

169
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,459
whether or not a particular network it's
good for training in the right direction

170
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,870
is by looking around at appears in
working with industry best practices are

171
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,860
there are six distinct but pretty
tightly connected to mention that we are

172
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,430
monitoring pay attention to here we've
we've touched on three of them and some

173
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,839
of the input that you could use in your
own program to start collecting similar

174
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,620
dimensions but the first one you need to
understand your vulnerabilities going up

175
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,750
are they going down in what areas of the
coming up are going down we break out

176
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,180
into two dimensions the first one its
breath just the number of the range of

177
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,550
hackers and particularly the range of
skills

178
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,550
that your that you're attracting if
you've got a large number of hackers if

179
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,449
those hackers are only reporting

180
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,490
bilities you do not have a great actor
breath and we can talk a little more

181
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,709
about what that means in a second but
we're trying to capture here do you have

182
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:33,890
a diverse skill set across across the
external factors that you have a good

183
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,430
looking after death this answers the
MSRTC question of how many one hit

184
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,079
wonders do we have how many people are
sending us one vulnerability to never be

185
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,599
heard from again is that a good thing or
bad thing

186
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,029
are they not coming back because there
simply are no more vulnerabilities or

187
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,209
this was exhausted their skill set or
they were unhappy about something in the

188
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,010
process and decided that it wasn't
positive experience for them or was it

189
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,689
worth their time or whatever it was a
range of things that goes into here but

190
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,640
this is something that we encourage our
customers pay attention to because

191
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,230
repeat hackers get far more effective
over time and we see the most successful

192
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,310
programs that we have do have a loyal
set of security researchers that they

193
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,939
hear from our regular kids and
responsibility in this again everyone

194
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,320
has different places like to stick to
hear differing definitions of equality

195
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,709
are but it's something that you should
at least be paying very close attention

196
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,329
to that the you can know if it's getting
better or worse and how to important but

197
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,569
they still want to talk about today when
his underwear competitiveness how

198
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,950
competitive is your bounty assuming you
already answered this question and the

199
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,930
second one to signal ratio there's a
number of ways that we visualize this

200
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,010
this is a lot that Marcus said that
anyone who shows you a pie chart is

201
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,740
lying to you and I'm lying to you right
now even those in a pie chart it's a

202
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,570
it's a spider charged with this is a
point-in-time snapshot of the six

203
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,790
different dimensions plotted against the
average enterprise which is the the red

204
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,250
box in the middle of the blue box is the
example program they were talking about

205
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:17,290
here this is a real an itemized live
program from her one and what to really

206
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,849
make the most of this you to try this
every time you know what they look like

207
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,660
last month in the month before before
our example we're taking a point

208
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,550
sidesteps I'm trying to answer the
question should I offer about it

209
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,680
here if you break this down into the
individual dimensions that we're looking

210
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
at on the vulnerability 6 I'd

211
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,510
about average you look at the average
enterprise from their external finders

212
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,480
they getting about that many
vulnerabilities coming in normalized

213
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,560
across the across the entire dataset

214
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,089
in a weighted average if you look at the
researcher breath they're also doing

215
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,140
quite well they're getting a range of
researchers a larger number of them then

216
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,949
they're in the industry average and
they're getting a diverse set of skills

217
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,540
coming out of here meaning there is a
multiple backgrounds and skill sets and

218
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,170
different creative use on the problem
being lovers and finally the

219
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,540
responsibility is is above industry is
doing much better here than their peers

220
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,670
are so if we don't take a step back in
and capture this we do see that there's

221
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,170
a massive chunk missing on their
underwear competitive side and I don't

222
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,880
mean that as a bad thing if we they're
just not offering any type of financial

223
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,010
incentive for the reporting of a
security vulnerability now but they're

224
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,459
clearly doing something right in that
they're getting above average response

225
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,560
is on every other metric so we ask
ourselves the question should this

226
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,319
organization or there is this product
offer but many program the time to meet

227
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:56,640
this need not like there's there's still
room for improvement you could get up to

228
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,839
a 10 on vulnerabilities found but if
you're still getting vulnerabilities for

229
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,760
free and you're getting a wide range of
researchers and the repeat customers

230
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,970
viewer value in offering a bounty is not
going to be as strong as it could be and

231
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,709
there are probably other investments in
your in your STL or your team or your

232
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,870
security program that are gonna be a
better return than an offering about it

233
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,550
but all of the starts with collecting
this in getting a sense of how do you

234
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,750
feel about response efficiency how
mental abilities trending and how many

235
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,179
external researchers in my engagement
with and ideally you can use some type

236
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,500
of benchmarking I but even if you don't
have the benchmarking capability you can

237
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,010
answer this and assess whether or not
you relatively happy about it

238
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,309
particularly by looking at how this is
twenty if you pay attention to this over

239
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:39,940
time you can get a very good sign

240
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,259
are we getting more finders or fewer
fighters than we did in the past and it

241
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:50,009
helps to answer that we take a second
example here is another live program and

242
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:57,360
one that is a program know no boundaries
offered yet but it's right around

243
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,149
average it's not terrible you still
getting vulnerabilities from the outside

244
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:09,250
to identify and responsibly disclosed to
the to the scheme but if you look at the

245
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,460
researcher breath there's not a not a
great distribution here the relatively

246
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,289
small number of fighters with a finite
set of skills and they're not fully

247
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:24,889
attracting the diversity of backgrounds
and experience and expertise that would

248
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:30,908
show the most value in these programs
and help get that one critically on the

249
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,419
good and they're very responsive program
they're responding quickly resolving

250
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,049
issues quickly and the response
efficiency looks pretty good

251
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:48,950
pose the same question again probably
spoil at this point for bounding here

252
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,730
starts to look a little bit better
you're feeling good about your response

253
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,190
time you're not engaging hardly a large
large number researchers you have some

254
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,980
amount of emphasis on upward movement on
both the depth and the vulnerabilities

255
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,070
fix and this is a perfect candidate for
offering bounties will probably drive

256
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,250
those are the three metrics higher it's
a little more nuanced than than that but

257
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,929
you can look at something like this and
say if we offered bounties we are

258
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:19,730
probably going to get significantly
better than we were getting before and

259
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,679
there's a really interesting topic of
conversation I'm going to not spend

260
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,360
eternity in today is how come some
organizations and the plague this and

261
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,758
some end up like this there's a range of
factors that go into that both from the

262
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,909
complexity of the challenge presented
the amount of credibility that they get

263
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:45,840
the response efficiency how respectful
you are to them how sexy it is two to

264
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,908
hack your particular product and that's
just the reality is that not everything

265
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,380
is created equal and some organizations
have to be any sooner

266
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,130
others simply because they're not
getting that extra attention that some

267
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,350
companies just get rather naturally
about trying to understand that is those

268
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:10,399
the first staged you may be looking
around in a problem with number one and

269
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,700
if you are gonna have a problem with the
only people have a clear channel for a

270
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,850
security researcher to send availability
report to them I've got a vulnerability

271
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,050
report and they descended that company
there's an obvious way to do it

272
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,900
usually don't get that many coming up
with got some advanced folks in the room

273
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,340
here and so if you're not already doing
that I would have a biased answer to you

274
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,939
and to say before you start asking
yourself the question do we found me or

275
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,870
do we not been any focus on asking the
question how come we just don't have the

276
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:49,719
security at inbox that we monitor and a
process for reporting vulnerabilities to

277
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,990
us is anyone wanna volunteering answers
to why they don't do that yet

278
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,210
Internet access you have internet
accessible product or service and no way

279
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,210
for viability be reported

280
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,519
you don't know what the response time is
going to look like even if you're not

281
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,349
offering cash incentives you going to
get something from the outside and

282
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:23,059
measuring that to start with his kind of
stuff but you're not even noon yet

283
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:28,229
another one unless you have this yet you
you need to understand your metrics you

284
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:32,619
need to know what is coming into your
program and what people are finding in

285
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,899
order to do it one of the big policies
that I worry about I'm a huge proponent

286
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,809
of a response or disclosure is something
that we have been getting for for a long

287
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:45,999
time and there is a big fallacy that if
no ones reported vulnerability to us or

288
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,299
we don't get that many there's just
nobody finding them and there's none of

289
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,359
them out there

290
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:54,668
the reality is that if you do not have a
clear process for reporting it there is

291
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:57,929
a huge amount of anxiety in the mind of
the individual before they go to submit

292
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,739
it to you are they going to sue me am i
sending it to the right place and by

293
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:08,820
using the right process am I doing
something wrong is this worth my time

294
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,259
and the answer unequivocally if you
haven't said here's where you send

295
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,349
security vulnerability reports is a very
very painful experience for the

296
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,769
researcher and they are far more likely
to just sit on that vulnerability and do

297
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,229
nothing

298
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:24,849
regardless of how they found it this
isn't about giving permission to hack

299
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:30,759
stuff or asking people to repentance
your service for free just no questions

300
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,409
asked if you found a vulnerability where
does it go and if you haven't answered

301
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:40,539
that question yet in your organization I
would state that it's a pretty heavy

302
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,539
prerequisites answering the question of
should you offer about me or not

303
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:49,889
deputy engineer in that the industry is
currently in a pretty sad state we get

304
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:55,718
this question from researchers at the
time like hey I use this product I was

305
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:59,450
signing up as I normally do on a putback
tick in my name and I think I just found

306
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,059
remote code execution I mailed their
customer success team I've mailed their

307
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:10,168
support team I sent there's CEO a diem
and like no one's responding to me what

308
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:15,659
should I do with this thing and it's
it's frustrating to me to hear something

309
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:22,809
like that like not just having anxiety
about what they do with that

310
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:27,620
that one of the things we launch the
summer was a community resources for

311
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,998
contacting security teams is a place
where research go time domain name and

312
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:34,580
if there is an established process for
disclosing a security vulnerability

313
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,320
it'll come up and show you like go to
this email address go fill out this web

314
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,059
form

315
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,918
here's what they want you to do before
they submit it here is what their legal

316
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,289
team says about vulnerabilities that you
might have found and I would encourage

317
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:52,289
you to think about what's stopping you
from getting a security out before you

318
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,869
start answering the question around
getting about me if you're in the case

319
00:23:54,869 --> 00:24:01,330
of you can't use method number one and I
i hit on this little more because it is

320
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,049
it is kind of shocking to me the state
of the internet is in right now we did a

321
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:12,899
survey of the Forbes Global 2000 over
the summer hiring people using

322
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:17,299
Mechanical Turk using multiple
consulting firms trying to answer the

323
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,740
question if you had a vulnerability in
this domain could you find a place to

324
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,509
send it to this is from the Help Center
we reset the press teams we kind of

325
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:34,799
security addresses and just focusing on
the Forbes 100 it is it said there are

326
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,889
only 13 companies of the largest hundred
companies in the world if you found a

327
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:46,240
vulnerability and today they would have
told you what to do it I'm actually on a

328
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,249
happier note the slides a little bit
outdated there's no fourteen companies

329
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:55,009
in the center because General Motors
launched a security at program a few

330
00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:01,379
expect we're down to 86% not having a
disclosure program at the time but this

331
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:08,490
is this is a frustrating to me
personally from someone who has really

332
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,710
been on some undesirable experiences in
in responsible disclosure and I i think

333
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,330
we need to have a stronger emphasis on
fixing this before we get hung up on the

334
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,330
should be down stuff yeah

335
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:33,380
yeah it's it's a slice the directory
it's a wiki style in with your account

336
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,290
can edit it there's an audit trail we
asked researchers 22 populated and keep

337
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:48,810
it up-to-date and there's a set of
operators that do it so that the domain

338
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,970
name is this even there yet it's
probably already there if not it's it's

339
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:01,250
with you create an account and created
or just email us for the moderators know

340
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,500
they're created for you if it's not a
real estate and you have a public

341
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:15,130
contacted us and so if we expect I am a
little more in that it is it's kind of

342
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,620
sad that people find vulnerabilities
today and don't know if they're going to

343
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,600
get sued or not as a as a result of
anything we should worry about sixty met

344
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,629
i plead with a relatively emotion like
every once in a while then I like to

345
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,850
lately and leaned on her friends at the
FTC you with a bit more of abrasive

346
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,310
approach to it the FTC is one of the few
organizations that is actually charged

347
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,740
with regulating security and enforcing
people who have had irresponsible

348
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,049
security practices they released a
summary in

349
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:47,980
again in the in the summer last year
around analysis of all of the enforcers

350
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,179
they've done over the last decade and
the common trends across them and one of

351
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,869
the ones at the top of their list is the
lack of an efficient process to receive

352
00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:02,488
an address on ability reports and I
would like to dive into the challenges

353
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,649
that are here but I would start with
trying to answer this before the

354
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:06,070
question

355
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:16,359
yeah this is about ways in to report

356
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:29,129
yes sorry that it's kind of a funny
memory that whether you got a response

357
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:36,529
to disclose your program or security yet
in this graph we're still calling that a

358
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,909
the disclosure program it's being
disclosed to the company it's not public

359
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:45,120
disclosure it's the researchers it goes
into the company that made have a public

360
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,908
disclosure policy not to tell everybody
that no no judgment on that this is

361
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:53,759
purely disclosure between the researcher
and the security team and for many of

362
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,929
these there is no valid on them like
number 12 of their right like that's not

363
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:03,330
a public disclosure program in in the
sense that there's notices for

364
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,149
everything that goes out there with
their subsets of products in there that

365
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:09,629
you have seized a sign in to have public
disclosure requirements with the

366
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:13,750
majority of the vulnerabilities
disclosed don't have any type of public

367
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,950
disclosure component to it whatsoever to
this is simply the reporting process and

368
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,370
you should use different security yet
programs but that turns a little even

369
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,370
less clear

370
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:45,070
get a Forbes 100 rank list you have to
plug in what it's meant to be not a

371
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,729
listing of everything out there it's
meant to be a search for a researcher it

372
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,889
I already have a vulnerability in this
domain and I am trying to figure out

373
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:55,718
what to do with it is the specific use
cases the directory choices so it's a

374
00:28:55,719 --> 00:29:00,179
certain point it looks like this it's
meant to put into domain name and/or a

375
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:12,200
company name and find the result for it
like published the dataset is no real

376
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,700
American people could scrape it really
should just publish it in a

377
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,359
machine-readable format for people to do
that

378
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:25,999
oh yeah there's this other list out
there that tackle that problem of who

379
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:30,159
pays money for vulnerabilities we don't
do that through the director me that

380
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,639
thinks that democrats alright I'm done
harping on on the lack of security at

381
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,149
addresses on the internet sorry sir but
the ten-cent

382
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:43,039
the second method if you do not have a
security program and you do not hearing

383
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,389
from researchers regularly is an invite
only program this is not publishing a

384
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:52,599
public method because your organization
has encountered fortunes are robots are

385
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:58,349
unanswered questions around how do you
run a security at program and so you can

386
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:03,629
start to gather data in a limited
invitation only but it's a pretty low

387
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:08,399
risk method for gathering data there is
no bugs that come in there's no

388
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,738
boundaries to pay because of the
unknowns around your response time of

389
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:13,799
all abilities

390
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,039
this is easily pause in a boarded you
have take control over volume meaning

391
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:20,739
you can say with a high degree of
accuracy how many vulnerability reports

392
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:24,200
you're going to get to ensure that
you're not taxing any metrics to you

393
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,509
haven't defined yet and the goal coming
out of this is to assess the readiness

394
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:32,379
of your STL for abounding in a
particular product or service so let me

395
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:35,379
give you an example scenario of what
that

396
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,409
or Oracle is not but they are in the
directory they have a security program

397
00:30:53,409 --> 00:31:08,749
there are five hundred programs that are
being run on Hacker 1 I'm there is a

398
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:12,690
much larger number of security at
addresses such as Oracle which are being

399
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,169
run outside of actor and that that would
be the case

400
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,049
hypothetically

401
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:42,630
afterwards I'll try to pick up a better
so this this starts by setting aside a

402
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,740
small budget similar to what you would
budget for a penetration test and a

403
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,980
scoping of one of your more secure
applications on your most secure

404
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,890
applications you should be looking at
those metrics that we talked about in

405
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,270
the top three dimensions of where my
getting vulnerabilities where am I

406
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,180
getting reports and where do I have
confidence in my response efficiency and

407
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,220
target that don't use a bug bounty to
target this horrible area of your

408
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,130
committee you don't wanna touch this
isn't about outsourcing your security

409
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,710
this is about finding the most secure
applications that you have in trying to

410
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:21,080
answer the question is this is my STL
here ready for external incentives and

411
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,230
we recommend starting very slow with
these you can do this through a platform

412
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,320
pretty clearly or if you have extra
researchers have said in the past you

413
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,460
can do this manually on your own invite
five to 10 of them just a small number

414
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,930
of people that you know is is the
recommended range that we start with and

415
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,630
we find that other these eighty percent
of our customers who run these programs

416
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,240
find a new critical security
vulnerability in the next 24 hours and

417
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,670
practically all of them find a new one
within three days that's a pretty

418
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:58,340
surprising I wanted to always use the
three day one everybody finds a critical

419
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,980
vulnerability in three days and
marketing people relate no one's gonna

420
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,680
believe you it's it's a lie you can't
say can say 99% you gotta get to go with

421
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,980
the eighty percent number so we're
sticking with 80% in the in the first

422
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:18,100
day these programs are incredibly
effective at identifying stuff that the

423
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,620
rest of your STL completely missed
there's been nobody out here is launched

424
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,250
a program that didn't find something

425
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,250
yeah

426
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:38,049
for these invitation-only wondered about
350 that's correct

427
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,740
but to really take a look at this you're
gonna want to benchmark your deviation

428
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,500
from the key metrics that arise in this
program in that that first time period

429
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,940
meaning you don't need to run these for
very long

430
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,100
the goal isn't to run it for a long
period of time it's the start measuring

431
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,350
what are you getting in a short period
of time to assess whether or not you

432
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,639
want to continue the program scale back
the program wrap up the program canceled

433
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,450
entirely and invest in some additional
areas that came out of it for example of

434
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,118
those 350 and that the hackers that
participate we see that on average each

435
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,379
actor is going to find 2.7
vulnerabilities across this process

436
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:26,509
dataset if you're running this and
you've invaded fight hackers and each of

437
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,169
them found five vulnerabilities you
probably don't want to invite the next

438
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,310
five hackers right away it's time to go
back and recesses metrics and look at

439
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,869
why were so many found from external
finders instead of all our internal too

440
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,570
willing to start with so take give you a
sense of what this looks like

441
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,060
externally again we recommend that
people start very small and they're in

442
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,480
their first month and invite just five
to ten we find that overall in the first

443
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,050
month of the 350 programs we see 22.6
researchers invited so what this is is

444
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:03,020
cohort in that first batch of the 22
researchers and just saying what if you

445
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,890
did nothing just invited them and let it
run for six months what is going to

446
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:14,089
happen with the initial incentives set
and over the six-month time so on the on

447
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,609
the right we've got the vulnerability
graph again we said you see 2.7

448
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:21,279
vulnerabilities per researcher even
though you invited 22 hackers to

449
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,490
participate you only get submissions
ballots emissions from 12 of them in the

450
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,919
first month in between all of them it's
about 33 vulnerabilities that come in in

451
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,890
those first in his first 30 days if we
look at month to this drops off

452
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,660
dramatically if you don't change
anything about how you're engaging and

453
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,160
you just stick with that first 22
researchers and the same amount that you

454
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,310
started with it drops off pretty quickly
we see a little bit of a spike in month

455
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,400
for because we find that for the first
of all watching these programs

456
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,960
their response time for

457
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,070
a resolution is usually somewhere
between 60 and 90 days which means that

458
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,510
in the third month you start seeing more
of those reports is often more the

459
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,349
county's paid out which is a trigger
point for that said I researchers to

460
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:11,030
come back and participate in the program
again or to follow up on things that

461
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,460
they found a workaround for and so you
see a little bit of a spike just because

462
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,060
you're naturally resolving stuff that
comes out this but by the time you get

463
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,279
six months in you are on that initial
set of 22 researchers that you invited

464
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,180
to the program you're only seeing
submissions from about four of them and

465
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,190
they are not finding as much anymore you
have started to exhaust the attention

466
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,400
span or the expertise disorder
researchers and there's a few of these

467
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,099
in here that you want to do engage with
but you are feeling relatively good

468
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,890
about using this initial cohort to
answer to gather enough data to answer

469
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,710
the question of the racial good about
the vulnerabilities are being found here

470
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,530
doing so good about my response time and
my finding the right of hackers and I

471
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:56,500
want to engage with normal if you're
running one of these programs in in life

472
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,830
you can have multiple these points
introduced at each set like you gonna

473
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,970
run with the first 22 and then by months
three you might decide if you look good

474
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:10,580
you invite another batch of researchers
and this trendline kicks off again but

475
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:16,290
what you're looking for here is that
your land line of what you're finding is

476
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,550
below the average that you would expect
and well within your threshold for

477
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,160
response efficiency so if you invite
again those five hackers and they each

478
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,980
fined 50 abilities your blue lines will
be much higher and there's work to do

479
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,260
before you invite more researchers and
expand the scope of this program

480
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,980
aggressively is going to be a very messy
side that I wanted to put it on your

481
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,830
people to look at this is that same
graph but with the main things that we

482
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:48,020
track going into it you running
additionally program invite 22 hackers

483
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,480
this is what it tends to look like on
average with a pretty way deviation for

484
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,480
customers out there by the end of the
six months you've found 6276 new

485
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,610
vulnerabilities and paid around $37,000
in

486
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,110
vulnerabilities downey's again these
trends pretty heavily if you're someone

487
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,590
who was only getting one submission per
hacker you're probably going to have a

488
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,720
higher amount here and lower bound the
average but just a sample cohurt this

489
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,970
gives you a pretty good idea of what you
should expect running a very small

490
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,370
Invitational in bodybuilding program
over the course of six months and from

491
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,500
this you should be able to start to
answer what areas do we want ongoing

492
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,620
incentives and said this is what you
want to success in to start looking like

493
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,830
as time goes on

494
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,340
normally we don't share these with
attribution but David were carefully

495
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,090
tweeted about it and I get to be able to
make it to use it in in slide decks but

496
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,190
right games does run a public security
yet they have for for many years they

497
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,640
accept report from external researchers
they go through this process of inviting

498
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,109
people in certain measuring how this how
this comes about and you see their

499
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:59,920
responsibilities right around average
but a very competitive reward pretty

500
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,660
loyal set of researcher participation
and has a ceiling that large number of

501
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:12,270
vulnerabilities found in the past so we
wrap this thing up this all starts with

502
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,800
your your SEO

503
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,920
found your not to bonnie is answered by
looking at your ass yeah I view bounty

504
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,110
programs as the ultimate measurement of
whether or not you're ICL is effective

505
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,410
in the ways you expected to be effective
it really helps you benchmark whether

506
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,790
not everything else you're doing is
working if you are relying on bug bounty

507
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:37,580
programs as a source of vulnerabilities
that should have been caught by known

508
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:44,759
systems or tooling in your STL it's not
effective use of researcher time you

509
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,850
want to leverage is defined as scarce
vulnerabilities not is more

510
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,020
cost-effective way of finding the stuff
that should be solved through frameworks

511
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,170
and you want to leverage stuff coming
out of this in a more people so measure

512
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,490
was coming into your to your security at
don't serve offering incentives right

513
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,060
away

514
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:10,320
want to track everything coming out of
here is kind of ridiculous to say so

515
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,270
much but nobody really pays a huge
amount attention to the metrics coming

516
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,950
out of their their security added a few
examples of companies to do this well

517
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,540
but if you're not monitoring that you
have a very hard time answering anything

518
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,920
else coming out of this and if you find
a bunch of stuff to go work on for

519
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,410
bigger product and service after you
measure this it's not time for bounty

520
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,160
program that back into your ass yet
we're all about finding stuff that is

521
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,420
going to improve your SEO process but as
you repeat the cycle you're eventually

522
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,660
going to start finding things where it's
like for this particular area were only

523
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,180
hitting diminishing returns we are not
getting everything we want our security

524
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,520
tool and it's time for additional
testing on it that we're going to

525
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,500
provide the most effective it is that
final my defense of everything else on

526
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,200
the outside and I want to find more
inputs back into my style I want to know

527
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:06,299
what I miss and I need humans to go look
for that on a ongoing recurring basis so

528
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,300
I've got three

529
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:43,779
based on what it looks like there are a
number of companies that will launch but

530
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,119
many programs because their security
comes person said hey other people are

531
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,720
doing this we should go do this to that
is a very bad answer to the bug bounty

532
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,379
of this or not I would exclusively use
how effective your STL is as the

533
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:05,970
measurement to should we found here and
so the question is if you run about

534
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:10,660
granny program before your STL is ready
for it it will probably look bad if you

535
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,129
are not running a bounty program I don't
think it particularly says anything

536
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:20,670
strange about your application or the
discrete about what I would focus on is

537
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,010
even if you haven't asked anybody yet
are your customers finding

538
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:30,060
vulnerabilities in the security product
are researchers finding it have any

539
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,560
other been found from the outside and
and how does that process tieback India

540
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,560
India SEO

541
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:18,029
yeah so the question is largely if you
run one of these ppl disclosed stuff

542
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:22,619
that doesn't make us look bad and how do
we get more control over it and you're

543
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,369
touching on a very pretty nuanced point
is that it's usually not framed in the

544
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:32,719
company's bests doesn't paint the
company the best point of view we have

545
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,180
much longer discussion around however
one deals with this but the answer on

546
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,149
our platform is we have a very
customizable defined workflow for how

547
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,529
public disclosure happens it is an
explicit request the researcher does to

548
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:48,920
say I want to publicly disclose this
here's the day that i'm gonna publicly

549
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,569
disclosed and the customer configures
what their disclosure policy asst some

550
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:57,390
customers say there's no public
disclosure here for this category issues

551
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,598
there's there's no disclosure date for
it and they define that ahead of time in

552
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,789
the policy in force it through other
customers say we want ninety days head

553
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:09,140
up heads up so the research when they go
to disclose its ninety days out and if

554
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,089
they wanna shorter they specifically
request an exemption through the

555
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:16,299
workflow in the product the public
messaging of that is a joint

556
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:20,519
communication between the researcher and
the individual there's toiling in intact

557
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,140
or 12 cents or the response to that the
timeline to just the activities that

558
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,839
occurred to provide an agreed-upon
summary is usually told with one voice

559
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,929
or at least both sides of the story in
the same thread in conversation if you

560
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:40,679
look through a bunch of the disclosures
on one you'll always see someone so

561
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,859
requested to publicly disclose this
report and the response team agreed to

562
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:48,189
publicly disclose this this report and
that doesn't necessarily mean the entire

563
00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:53,229
email thread is is disclosed that's one
of the defaults other times you just see

564
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:56,779
the disclosure timeline and advisory
posted up top particularly for those of

565
00:44:56,779 --> 00:45:04,699
the story there is you want to have
control over your disclosure process if

566
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:09,259
you're relying upon if you haven't
disclosed described as defined in

567
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:12,890
disclosure prob policy you're not going
to have any control of your process and

568
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,038
I would start with that first and then
in the ideal case is a blatant sales

569
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,440
pitch use a platform that has a codified
workflow

570
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,010
004 disclosure so that it doesn't go
wrong and if somebody does do something

571
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,589
like just published a blog post without
giving you a heads up then it's a clear

572
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:41,000
violation of your your policy that I was
looking more broadly about the

573
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,020
disclosure in general but yes doing it
out of band disclosure that does not

574
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,130
adhere to your policy with certainly
invalidate them from the bounty but it's

575
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,700
not really the hammer this out simply
doing that we've we've done this over

576
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,759
10,000 vulnerabilities we see a public
disclosure requested about one out of

577
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,510
every 35 or so and we have not had a row
disclosure yet on the platform where

578
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,130
someone was just like I'm not giving you
any heads up I'm just disclosing this it

579
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,170
is a concern that we would move people
from the platform that did that and if

580
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,710
you are operating in good faith and
saying here's our user policy that we'd

581
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,220
like you to follow for disclosure it
goes right farmer often that it goes

582
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,000
right to go wrong at one point in time
but the road disclosures when there's a

583
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,560
clearly defined workflow for it is
pretty rare and that were closed usually

584
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,619
pretty well by the researcher yeah

585
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:05,540
and industry average is misleading it is
a beautiful way to lie with statistics

586
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,930
you need to look at

587
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,029
averages across product lines what they
expected their SDA SCL

588
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:17,400
isolate and I would start with defining
what you think the expectation should be

589
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,000
for that product if you think it's
ninety days and you have the 90th

590
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,430
percentile is a hundred eighty days you
should communicate to those people that

591
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:31,250
we expect to take 280 days here and if
that admission is is embarrassing to to

592
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,840
you or not but you're happy with start
holding the team's accountable to that

593
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,530
and use it as a tool for getting better
response time there and you think you'll

594
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,600
find out that as long as you communicate
with the expectations are is a much

595
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,819
stronger strategy then whether or not
you conform to an industry average or an

596
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,859
industry best practice and because it is
going to be so dramatically different

597
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:56,690
for every single product we have
customers that have automobiles on the

598
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:01,240
street that have disclosure timelines
associated with them and the disclosure

599
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,899
timeline resolution time for that is
very different from how long does it

600
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:12,310
take to fix anybody else

601
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:38,078
it depends so we just a few weeks ago
and what the average is look like that

602
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,079
to you afterwards that the short answer
is on average across the entire platform

603
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,160
it's held pretty average about $500 per
vulnerability over the last two years

604
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,009
but the top programs on the platform if
you look at the ones that have success

605
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:57,609
index it looks more like this there
consistently trending up and it's

606
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:02,750
currently above $1,100 average per
vulnerability but the total count of all

607
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,990
abilities to significantly down from
when they started and that should be the

608
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,209
goal you should be looking for the total
number of vulnerabilities in finding is

609
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:13,200
going down and the total amount that i'm
paying for them are it amounted to an

610
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:21,509
individual basis is going up I don't
think everybody
