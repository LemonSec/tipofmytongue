1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:32,219
reduction thank you for taking the
copper climbed but part of the

2
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,659
application could get through the work
we do it in a very very important and it

3
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:46,680
all on the same there are no application
tomorrow after my meeting know a lot

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:55,850
about the face and then I think I know
you know it's life I think my show me

5
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:03,449
how much I know I don't know or lowered
be described by so I really depend on

6
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,460
the inquest in the feedback and the
contributions about it to keep myself

7
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:17,030
level 2 923 which is why I already have
given me a lot but he's a pretty had a

8
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:26,509
lot more maybe maybe maybe he see people
I think it probably would have wanted an

9
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:35,110
important part in all about people so i
don't realize what you were directly

10
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,850
oversaw next week back

11
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,000
94 I was kind of happy young man and
find the need for kind of figured it out

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,390
there

13
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:54,680
everything that I learned there look for
parody of these very large problem and I

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,920
think my safety probably all of it by
far the most important and you know I

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,799
met you yet to secure software like
crazy good results found that there is

16
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:15,630
and there's no bus there are no books on
the subject there are no lights bigger

17
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:28,859
things here and there were rumors that
day but the acting was that we can be

18
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,930
anything you want to get in for nearly
two decades now it's not quite so and

19
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,280
it's not but it's not so remember
reading mostly because people they get

20
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,840
the issue and that we deal with the
problems that way there's go to get or

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,290
do their work on that yet we must do
security lifecycle that implies it

22
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,630
started as a weirdo software written and
directed at security code going to buy

23
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,320
the crime of this terrible weather is
already one billion websites on an old

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,370
number occupation and so a lot of the
risk that we've seen repeated come from

25
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:14,609
the legacy issue so we find ourselves in
general for your world and what I find

26
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:23,390
it a lot of people out here and you're
something like that he had read the

27
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,290
briefs or briefs right thing that I do
can you just like any of our ability to

28
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,328
reach where the vulnerability is not
understood the collapse of it or not we

29
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:41,690
could not find this long ago did we do
not assume liability exceed a single one

30
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,319
we don't know how

31
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,548
working in different ways but you're
right I thought I was the only one left

32
00:03:51,549 --> 00:04:00,129
and yours but why did he could be known
problem I think that make up your mind

33
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,739
it's not a knowledge eg Roberts
illusions lack of standard water bottle

34
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:13,310
we have laughed it off work at it we
know how to cure generally see what we

35
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,918
are doing it right here

36
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,370
going to challenge conventional thinking
better probably from the industry and

37
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:34,210
the vendors are not going to like it I
do not care what other people about

38
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:41,180
their microphone for the record my
little bit about life and it's not you

39
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,349
know like that before you sent the
company how long we've been around

40
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:53,330
things like that I guess in normal our
job is to find the volatility and the

41
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:00,270
bad guy who eventually what and the
whole idea of 47 or if you prefer if you

42
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:09,770
increase the guy who experience already
in the system if we do our job here are

43
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,570
two great idea what the presentation and
by began going to show your home today

44
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:28,030
are so popular but more on that we know
who's available and how often and 2006

45
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,030
were sharing the broad trend in the
industry actually see it how many people

46
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,568
in Jackson how long

47
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,149
Daily Show to figure out that it's a
required flying friend and he wanted it

48
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:48,659
and they contacted them over now what
did I do like it needed to be done but

49
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:55,580
got broken up into third on whether it's
like a walkie clause Robert into the

50
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:07,128
article does not compute limited to be
looking at these are my understanding

51
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:14,379
right actors understand if their
candidate for Singapore pool so I the

52
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:22,029
bag lady do they have to find you would
have put heber go into the city or do we

53
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:30,339
see them more skin tissue and broader
market well I think you guys are mostly

54
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:35,050
standing because the weather is very
little bit longer in their Articles

55
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,379
remaining looking at what they're going
to action everywhere

56
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,990
whenever our guide says you know

57
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,749
products will be profitable whatever
they have to be a two-out seal the bag I

58
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:55,289
get out there and what they're up there
I also one of the intersection of

59
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:00,688
insider insurance on a really hard on
the votes to intersection of security

60
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,749
blanket inside her strengths because I
will in fact it won't be today and

61
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:11,149
tomorrow and next week I hear what our
industry does we're going to have new

62
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:17,550
masters and like it or not I'll get into
that would be easier burden upon going

63
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:27,569
to be Asian are 2384 they want a flight
at a park we have developed ease we have

64
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:34,710
no problems and hundreds of other people
and we bury development

65
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,950
what we're not currently has succeeded
in the grand scheme of things what good

66
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:50,810
is it if we're going to millions of
homes and 6-1 and so right now what

67
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,900
would that do they pick so I mean do the
tracheotomy general features that the

68
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,840
business off the money order they take
too long ago put it in a box and really

69
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,630
know what they choose not to reduce the
burden of one billion mediate you do

70
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,140
that you are equal measure of security
and out of this is what I kind of

71
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,979
figured it out for that I'll be dead he
does have a lot of it on this is we have

72
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:31,540
become better track the QA thought that
goes out for training can go now to try

73
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:43,690
and be more direct but I never happen

74
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:51,650
we can list all the time but where is
the day that if we do these things

75
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:59,160
the metric to me if we do these things
and do the board believe all the time to

76
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,689
fix it shouldn't happen when they do
things we don't think so but our

77
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,150
industry had 20 data backup the stuff
that we go to the vet tomorrow we should

78
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,480
do better than that the other day that
sounds like a good idea

79
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:24,380
ok I finally got underway get out there
and we don't have to you know we have

80
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:32,430
seen it work at 11 we don't really so
what we did was allow that in a little

81
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,839
bit more like how vulnerable they did
but I didn't know we didn't know what

82
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:49,940
you're doing it so we can regress and
how it impacted the out what we can to

83
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:59,400
try that if they do this outcome I think
we're much better than the applications

84
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:08,340
that he showed his company here that's
not hire out that everybody would like

85
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,620
people so we gotta bring more and more
people into the state of the economy

86
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:20,100
right model in source code reviews
dynamic at the you know that we are

87
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,610
never ever catch we're never going to
eliminate many of us that all humans

88
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,910
were going to be an expert no matter
what we do something tomorrow but we're

89
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,770
going to need more people coming in

90
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,400
builder greater gender what had

91
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:46,699
read it we're really doing baby so very
very productive right after I think

92
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,250
mostly mostly got to be the same using
the same I figured I do too broad

93
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:57,550
popular right actors wherever we have a
half of us anonymous things like that I

94
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:04,370
classify them more than they have to get
a political message out there I don't

95
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,370
pay too much attention because they're
going to make their presence known not

96
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,770
possible I would say so I can see myself
more with the organized crime ties

97
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,900
ninety percent of the time in a little
bit as you say just of my device the

98
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,270
organized crime they're much more
sinister you're not doing anything to do

99
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:32,730
with featured at this exciting to be at
the ceiling your money and there are a

100
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:40,020
lot of money they do that building so
for your sake I know and everybody

101
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,949
together in major cities often
capability for japan's economic

102
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,120
advantage of all over the place again
really think we might see some activity

103
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,800
thought they were trying to instill a
popular computer so that my humble

104
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:07,560
myself with a needle now I'm gonna get
the data like your BBQ but first I

105
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:17,030
thought it was a little small but that
we want to know what areas are most

106
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,400
affected by what does this come from the
right

107
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,020
writing data breach investigations
report in my opinion it is the same as

108
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,100
well as part of the only required
reading in our car industry if you have

109
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,310
any

110
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:38,140
prepared for it all to you what's going
on in the right place on the web

111
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:44,620
application by air and on the vertical
you have all the way everybody that I

112
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,290
can get information

113
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,360
45 percent of their brief me to do it

114
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,420
financial services 31%

115
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:01,319
most beautiful web security number one
or number you get the manga it works we

116
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,560
got through that and then we could be
putting our resources where they're the

117
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,140
most impact

118
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:17,670
repair only five percent don't know what
that means maybe people that are going

119
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:26,750
to the point of sale 2013 how the back
of breaking into into the system but the

120
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,910
guy who won their heat here again this
time from the ground it right and a

121
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,780
brief report this is the last year to
poor they're working on the latest album

122
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,069
out this year organized crime became the
most frequently see reactor or web

123
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:49,230
application now you can see me but what
does your credit card back to do it

124
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,760
without the feature but people going on
here talking about this

125
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,170
they seek yeah you know some other
unrelated system breakdown of your

126
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,270
credit card number or password and use
those Catholics to go out to the artist

127
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:12,560
releases a very tasty sequin jacket at
number three what happens when I get to

128
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,520
market a secondary plan you will hold
you in certain on for this is the method

129
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:26,089
could be a hit they want and extracted
and it's really just a couple so we

130
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,029
think a lot of times we should walking
down the front door but it's not pretty

131
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,230
enough

132
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,100
and you know anything about the video
that most companies out there have no

133
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:43,870
idea what website owner Mark problem
that is unsolved in the industry no one

134
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:53,700
knows how can you possibly like a
beautiful evening profitably showed that

135
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:01,230
63 percent of the web and you know a lot
of people out with a small profit $50

136
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:07,200
for people with a number of recent he'll
be back at you seem to be using and in

137
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:23,550
addition of energy department that are
out there maybe your songs this week

138
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:31,099
maybe somebody gonna play some of those
that don't know how people to do so but

139
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:43,280
the assessment there is that if I could
probably I don't have her back because

140
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:58,319
of what happened in the case of arriving
departing now that we have that they

141
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:08,720
don't have to go into the reported
seeing how was a primary or a third

142
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,490
party suppliers they probably help you
not appalled

143
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:23,839
what we gonna do now and higher keeping
or whatever that require other riddled

144
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,089
with balls and they may or may not get
the bad guys are doing the web

145
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:36,339
application now let's look at the
numbers you know capital that's right I

146
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:42,300
want to know how much you want to know
what they find it boring but that is

147
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:50,529
where they swear they sent so you're
back all this idea how their five

148
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:57,529
billion dollars on every single year you
now have full access to me by here and

149
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:06,429
it's going to lead him into this market
five billion per year and the industry

150
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:13,990
breakdowns on what industry you know
whatever the case may be important now

151
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:21,689
that the broad members there had been a
report I don't like this is how many

152
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,920
vulnerabilities and what types of planes
this is different from what I've

153
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,280
actually I can tell you what I can tell
you what the back to you tonight what we

154
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,690
need to do it all I give you a possible
motive you act like that so it's like

155
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:45,559
you're in a likelihood popular way to
realize that what happened but at least

156
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:56,980
11 people in one body looking at profit
which is one of the most popular guy not

157
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,600
a number of numbers by the eighties and
nineties right now

158
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,490
profit for being in our customer base is
about 45

159
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,790
have one more likely a lot more about
the way to stop this chart because the

160
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:17,330
top of the bag I wonder what are you
going to market open to whatever what

161
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:26,678
are the odds that I didn't think that
far and it is now following code to find

162
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:32,260
a vulnerability describe what it is and
go please tick this hired a name for

163
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,980
those issues we want to start measuring
60 feet hurt them a window of

164
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,470
opportunity for the bad guy so when we
find more abilities born believe this

165
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,140
website is this that you're those
affected more measured adult in between

166
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,530
this is the actor David Boreanaz
industry again delivery this is what

167
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:57,428
they think the work of the worse the
retail industry when we find face high

168
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:03,110
critical or the one you really should
average time to fix these two hundred

169
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:17,399
and twenty seven days a medical report
what the transportation middle of the

170
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:28,999
road that say they plan to ensure a ban
on adverse 1868

171
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:36,999
six months while we consider cost of
remediation numbers while the armed

172
00:19:36,999 --> 00:34:46,360
robbery they are we to do better and
this is in the room

173
00:34:46,360 --> 00:35:41,110
we don't buy that way we don't like we
don't write nothin

174
00:35:41,110 --> 00:38:01,190
industry operates drops it all here for
you guys

175
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:53,260
one-in-three chance that you're gonna do
when it comes to work again let's say

176
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:59,780
you're gonna happen when the Board of
Directors when the when they win the

177
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:08,000
popular said Board of Directors help
with that added number when the security

178
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:17,510
department was that could be a good one
you could order to record properly

179
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:27,349
accountable here for another we don't
want that when the security people make

180
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:36,339
you a much better job all right so it's
hard to read and put it on the border of

181
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,520
record with a countable

182
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:52,660
to fix the department had 14 days but it
didn't seem to a record one of the dryer

183
00:39:52,660 --> 00:40:01,589
prior year 2013 in fact one of the main
drivers with plant number one driver was

184
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:03,430
quiet now

185
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:18,919
35% the 130 work with that story when
the media writer by a large number

186
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:37,020
probably really going out with a plan to
the only fighter bombers and remediation

187
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:45,400
that these policies will only be one
more slide here and say when you start

188
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:55,440
learning these when it really matters
here and we can't let me know if you

189
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,890
want your number of hope and belief in
Peru even drop the average number of

190
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,578
older why not

191
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,049
mediation

192
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:16,299
AdvoCare everything will be in the
environment for mediation but not this

193
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:25,710
will lessen that we've been working
there are no that there are more when

194
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:36,010
you better come with one another bowl
mix of mediation backed out not sure yet

195
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:45,770
where we're making believe through all
my might

196
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:56,009
no one can drive it down but they would
pick $500 abilities when the right very

197
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:06,880
good because it today because he had
always there like that what's going on

198
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:16,570
in the eighth at home they're probably
wait and they know they have so many

199
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:23,780
smaller or maybe you a few framework
issue or something like that might be

200
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:34,860
one of the issues in the case workers
here now back on any given that this

201
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:43,280
might be a party issue where the
volatility is a lot more going on here

202
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:58,060
to earth and then pick the most likely
to go back to the web

203
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:09,299
everyone everyone will be on that
everyone got over two million people

204
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:46,210
shop here we got here every part of her
life at all

205
00:43:46,210 --> 00:45:08,330
those shares local times is that they
also see those questions what they did

206
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:15,529
is they hate you have somebody security
firewall testing its primary those

207
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,770
executives and saying I hope we going to
have controls yes the questionnaire will

208
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:26,060
be submitted yes the previous will be
paid but I think there is a benefit that

209
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:33,150
they see all those questions that not
only the security changes

210
00:45:33,150 --> 00:46:19,610
there

211
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,560
goals
