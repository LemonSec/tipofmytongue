1
00:01:21,060 --> 00:02:30,420
cost of course the capability to Philly
is capable of doing different types of

2
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Florence

3
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,410
so cool

4
00:02:43,170 --> 00:03:02,959
customize this year so at all don't
customize it to do and what the tools

5
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:16,319
have capabilities you need to take a
banjo read out of the box but it may be

6
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:30,399
happy and there is going to be running
on a workstation environment where these

7
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:52,780
are different factors about my people so
all schools not also vs he has a very

8
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,530
long time

9
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:10,130
sure there is being tested

10
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,630
tested

11
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:34,409
personal doing it we're located so

12
00:04:34,910 --> 00:05:02,070
house number one skill set to become
better people skills and people skills

13
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:18,350
and sometimes so these are so low that
security is not the same thing

14
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:38,610
make sure you're supposed to go to
ensure that the code is actually kind of

15
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:58,320
exciting things happen checklist for
only publish and back we may even have

16
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:08,540
somebody that is draining so you know
there's lots of this crisis John sure

17
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:23,590
there's other published works there this
is what we know now had a certain length

18
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:44,630
again this is a very much you were
talking to us back for analysis tool

19
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,800
tools

20
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,489
customize all these things come into
play and these are huge

21
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:15,169
just like you are so certain want two
things how can you be so it's going on

22
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:23,409
to agree with your continued there's a
lot of factors can really use a tool

23
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:32,990
that's going to take him two days just
came home base so some told him a set of

24
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:51,340
tools more so this is actually done
security code use as we have bad days

25
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:58,179
sometimes receiving sometimes you don't
see thanks so myself and personal to me

26
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:13,130
checklist checkers different way we're
going to see types of problems

27
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,099
things differently and so that's just
part of the peace

28
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:33,940
third kind of interesting start of the
messages I is another word for word for

29
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:54,430
this desire to do so

30
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:45,370
so many back to be completed this topic
types of analysis so sites all these

31
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,110
things

32
00:09:47,110 --> 00:10:01,360
risk rating system where you can imagine
being only accessible by production

33
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:30,280
staff are well should call then you're
so even if she goes that loss so we can

34
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:37,510
use whereas I'm looking at you

35
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:58,270
I'll tell you at this point that I but
if it doesn't know how it's being so

36
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:26,529
when we talk about work online and about
so this is trying to do things like this

37
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:47,850
is all so called was easy but I think
you talked about this and not everyone

38
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:57,900
can do this and it doesn't matter that
you have a very good one of the reasons

39
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:24,689
that is exactly the case of this total
war and so don't waste time control and

40
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:36,560
focusing on a compliment you see the
same go with mister vote on some very

41
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:46,529
big fines so try to figure out with us
you can see the poorest countries there

42
00:12:46,529 --> 00:13:10,480
will be no doubt guess not so much what
I was doing things as far as I know

43
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:33,870
there is no this piece of code too good
but if I point it will get better but

44
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:49,649
there is no and then tell them to you as
a person has to

45
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:54,499
I think that kinda like that so many
gallons

46
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:10,980
cool how this is playing out what's
interesting about to have so does

47
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:24,720
anything that can be created and create
this look up all involved in all that

48
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:51,589
that person internal internal we use
your responses

49
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,779
oh yeah people

50
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:13,670
something really special for Microsoft
is not at all when basically forays

51
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:48,050
described this as and there's a lot of
work to you so we built around us there

52
00:15:48,050 --> 00:16:18,359
is deciding how it felt that I needed
quickly get it means
