1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:33,699
talk to people they connected cars what
could possibly go wrong

2
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:45,449
secular the presentation from many folks
are not aware of all be called the BB or

3
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:52,930
bugle vehicle program before you get
started just a quick housekeeping things

4
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,769
if you could please turn itself off the
fire you're gonna be affecting open

5
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:06,548
defined by the balls are allowed back to
the police and the diversity of

6
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:12,630
questions just read this is by no means
a scripted presentation this is as much

7
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,449
a community education presentation more
than anything else about the vehicle to

8
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:27,960
be able program and making presentations
and 2015 or similar property be six or

9
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,880
seven provinces usually better tell me
some explaining what the vehicle to

10
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,929
vehicle program is people started asking
questions about that will create an open

11
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:55,430
source of all i'm happy for those 5 p.m.
and will be followed here everybody will

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,590
you drive in a car right right ok so
this presentation will provide

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,720
and then later in the program i'll be
talking about Fort Lee will also have

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:16,360
everyone in the room now it's not really
connected parts connected to the

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,780
Internet that are actually part of the
internet just like everything else

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,950
connected to it and I actually heard
back in a couple of Toyota engineers

17
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,130
when they were talking at me and he said
he looked around callers are part of

18
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:37,609
that they already is not here I love the
subtle difference but I have completely

19
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,790
if you accept the assumption that
would've known as the Internet of Things

20
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,250
a physical object that can be connected
to the Internet essentially happened I

21
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:56,019
was part of the effort from cell phones
to washing machine to our automobiles

22
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,209
that we have one of our engineers very
recently bought the refrigerator her and

23
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,730
he notice that one day his network
traffic was light and everything was

24
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,590
very very slow and he being a security
point that it is refrigerator because

25
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,989
refrigerator a little LCD cable walk-up
interview with everything ok it was an

26
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,840
IP addresses fortunately only being used
as a mail server

27
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:37,459
bad enough to make it for them I mean
that's what the internet things is

28
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:45,980
certainly vulnerable everyone here knows
that both their folks about it baby

29
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,560
monitors you can tap in

30
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,020
take over the video training to concede
that what's what's being monitored the

31
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:02,250
Stuxnet attack on your back and in fact
18 months ago I told you that hackers

32
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:15,330
heat uniform watching a crowded movie
but that happen what enables the

33
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:26,990
internet now that are related directly
to the Internet software and the magic

34
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:38,210
of software because even the hardware
drivers talking with the hopes of Asian

35
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:46,469
business morning about the new castles
and one of the engineers who have just

36
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,260
recently Castro Castro 85 D and he was
very excited because they hadn't yet

37
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,080
have the power to limit is five miles an
hour with software they had passed the

38
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:14,140
popular software to limit our our world
here to put will that dream wire coated

39
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,229
it you own it

40
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:35,120
rapper 1.7 million line the software in
it and you got to go over 1500

41
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:50,140
today over a hundred computing

42
00:05:50,140 --> 00:06:03,280
five networks miles seized in my head
about operating systems in approximately

43
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,530
50% car adapter

44
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,500
possible

45
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,710
introduced in 2002 the power of the
Internet

46
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,469
also join with me in turn it around the
only reason we put the wheels on the

47
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,160
cars these days is to stop the computer
working on the ground at the party and

48
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:43,730
if applicable to the $350,000 imagine
how many possibilities riding around on

49
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:50,220
a bit what a wonderful ability for about
a month ago to the way that they would

50
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,240
be connected powerful mobile back for
what has become however there are some

51
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,620
differences plastic network computer
typically turn it over 23 years we've

52
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,080
all seen our our company that every two
years you get a new computer at least in

53
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:15,460
part over 10 years what about all the
other thing that outside the automotive

54
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,349
industry almost assault problem with
respect to security authentication not

55
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:28,419
automotive struggle with this fact the
latest version of the software is going

56
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,090
to all of you for your caller to your
home wi-fi

57
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:39,099
at work yet thought you would reduce all
the best of our abilities in your home

58
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:57,430
network and Tarmoh you can be harder a
lot more this year than 45 million

59
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:06,190
power on the roadway in another five
years were $150

60
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,240
external threats threats have a vehicle
and all of these

61
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:23,490
you might think well how reasonable is
it really a higher that the most side

62
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:30,430
where you can within 3 p.m. are you
actually get access to that particular

63
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,430
monitor is right now

64
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:48,329
lot of over $100 level quote in modern
days and I'm also a research fellow at

65
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,959
the pony and recently conducted a survey
in the automotive industry the software

66
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,010
engineers in the almost manufacturers of
questions about you know my software

67
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,100
company takes priority

68
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,630
yes but one piece I found most
interesting question how difficult is on

69
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:20,360
those occasions and 69 percent of the
respondents difficult or very difficult

70
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:29,459
these folks that are writing software
companies these are not security control

71
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,010
these these are the folks are writing
software more than two-thirds of them

72
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:45,830
being difficult or very difficult to
figure out of course present how many of

73
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,620
us feel very familiar with the recent
past

74
00:09:52,050 --> 00:10:03,979
trying to call this is the 2014 edition
little later different almost finish

75
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,660
right now it's literally a book that's
freely available on the internet you can

76
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:20,180
download by the only good guy but I
really wanna hurt the religious reason

77
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:32,390
he wants to know where this all really
helpful there is more like a star on

78
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,069
certain amazing story actually beyond
our system

79
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:46,770
general motors fire was founded in 2005
allows remote control of everything

80
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,710
except the ceiling in the braking system
in the

81
00:10:49,710 --> 00:11:04,050
your motor homes are you don't it's
alright it's alright all the volatility

82
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,050
37 2005 when do you think

83
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:16,720
2006 2014 guy and you're definitely

84
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,620
2005

85
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,360
actually they have been fixed

86
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,440
laughs and says may twenty years later

87
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,890
between those vulnerabilities in the
vulnerabilities that were found that the

88
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:44,449
crisis is all possible to slaughter the
security researchers found to be

89
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,630
all-star vulnerabilities caused it to
all star but did not go public with it

90
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,040
general motors actually acted
responsibly and I know you think it will

91
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,060
take years to pay phone bill possible
they actually acted responsibly dubbing

92
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,439
straightaway the reason to fix all the
problems is because the system so

93
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,040
antiquated

94
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,410
they have to do a whole lot of
architecture and fix them just like any

95
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:22,630
other system actually did take them ten
years to resolve all abilities but again

96
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,330
there are being proactive about it there
and was a force as well as Jeep Chrysler

97
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,140
but it just goes to show a range of
security vulnerability and responses

98
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,300
that are available and again just
building that works here

99
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,360
35 device unlocked almost anything
really

100
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:59,220
lot of a lot of talk about the eponymous
driving cars this is actually a security

101
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,260
vulnerability was found by researchers
at my company security innovation with

102
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:09,040
about $40 off-the-shelf equipment and
laser pointers and things like that the

103
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:18,610
reason they essentially take the car
because we're prob gonna kill those

104
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:33,740
officers around the park nothing around
leader images now but practically be

105
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:42,160
there in this country in nearly four
million injuries from automobile

106
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:52,439
still the number one leading cause of
death for people

107
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:02,060
85234 get high school but part of the
reason that all of these associations

108
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,489
like Mothers Against Drunk Driving Do
you get from try to form is because

109
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:20,700
cystic because twenty-five thirty years
ago led the country was today so what

110
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:31,560
does the government want to do about it
but i wanna put more thought he did a

111
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:39,670
great idea but I know this is horrible

112
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:50,630
the folks there certainly think I got my
car let me know what the objective here

113
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,470
is that matter

114
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,870
get practice is the reason the entire
program we're talking about coming up on

115
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:11,540
the program evolution of automobile
safely back in the nineteen fifties were

116
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,029
driving around while no seat belts
laughed wasn't shatterproof

117
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:31,480
are pretty unsafe volved in like seat
belts and Natalie devolves into the path

118
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,870
of restraint this is taking it to the
next level to try to move it from after

119
00:15:37,870 --> 00:16:08,440
two prior short video here to talk to
explain that to do so here it is a

120
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:26,880
database that can be detected but
centers are you going to do with the ECB

121
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,589
we now have the technology to avoid
these using it for 80 percent of

122
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,589
impaired driver

123
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:48,479
making it and being most important
traffic and the police

124
00:16:52,019 --> 00:17:06,059
than it is today can be tracked the
technology for high level of production

125
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:20,648
now before I get too much further
details of what I do not work for the

126
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:27,489
government department transportation my
family security has been involved in

127
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,240
this program

128
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,190
2007 role is to help the fire security
and privacy components of the system to

129
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:43,020
make sure that it's not only anti tamper
but protects the property of drivers and

130
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,918
also claimed that will be more later

131
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,190
just be you know how does this setting
up your total order book this program

132
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,899
that is why we've been involved were not
nine years but let me explain what it is

133
00:17:54,899 --> 00:18:02,860
he may have gotten to be here this is a
mandatory program mandated by the

134
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:10,428
unabomber reputation as a factor in this
country is going to carry hardware and

135
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:21,360
software broadcasters the location of
the meeting at Allmusic manufacturing

136
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,820
automobiles care equipment that
broadcasters and location

137
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,470
why are they doing

138
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,899
wife based on a wire protocol including
11 P

139
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:46,360
this going to be your party gonna be
broadcasting your location and about 300

140
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:56,658
meters radius doing that all the readers
doing that is so you can have a great

141
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:03,309
reputation system to avoid the
high-speed pollution and again backlight

142
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,309
metric is really the driving factor here

143
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:15,000
Department transportation estimates with
26% of non he paired my feet practice I

144
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,289
don't know where they got six percent
they do some study back the

145
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:25,240
transportation moral transportation
secretary boss all this most important

146
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,799
thing about a pretty big statement for a
politician and I don't because a

147
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,760
politician I think he's actually pointed
it also happens to be the world's

148
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,140
largest city management this is ever
going to see which are going to be a

149
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:55,220
jacket here is to notify drivers General
Jack Jack was recently

150
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:09,059
driving very fast car now begun when I
don't care what they can drive or both

151
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,489
possible he's driving the middle of
downtown Los Angeles going through the

152
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,360
Japanese test law is going to 35 miles
an hour in the photo below through the

153
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,159
red light and smashed in the forecast

154
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:36,490
in a Ford Focus this system will notify
both drivers but there is a danger of

155
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,710
ending crash on the automobile
manufacturer

156
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:58,470
goes far to prevent this freaking out
what did you can stop the car to be

157
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:08,820
drilling program is of course which is
why security problems begin when I think

158
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,550
he to be asked because it's not just
people would be appalled as also be able

159
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:20,190
to infrastructure right now for example
with started a program in committing

160
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,460
five of the main avenues

161
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:30,930
all the stoplights interchanges be
equipped with your car

162
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:38,560
powerful constructor politely doing that
is to increase the federation but also

163
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:51,169
to measure anything like that little bit
more like everyone will be able to

164
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:57,360
finish it off the assembly line with us
as you're driving along as you could be

165
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,419
used all the time as those numbers are
difficult start to get depleted it a

166
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:09,860
little bit easier to use the system of
them so you get off how it's going to

167
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:16,129
cost them off you go to you you know
you'll get your own certificates are not

168
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,270
known to do that they were building into
the infrastructure

169
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,840
folks can get pop up automatically the
Catholic Ford Focus county of down and

170
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,090
less than 30% certificate repopulating

171
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:37,000
also wrote that be there shortly after
market devices though just got home

172
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,450
where technology network a few Ford
Focus might not because it was built for

173
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:47,230
them and they can't even buy aftermarket
device is more focus with the CD

174
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,830
technology but you have to offer

175
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,850
do you have the ability to do not

176
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:29,890
location from the tachometer

177
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:41,120
that's always a concern raised had one
of these aftermarket devices love you

178
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:51,659
Phillip put it in a fall asleep in the
car was gonna create habitat is also

179
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,900
concerned about what are known as the
are vulnerable road users government has

180
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:04,710
borrowed that users are things like
bicyclist motorcycle you definitely want

181
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,370
to protect those thoughts as well
because they're part of that leading the

182
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:19,540
market devices that are read only
broadcast system because a mobile device

183
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:26,840
can be anywhere but they can also
privacy concerns will be in SA be able

184
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:35,810
to spy on us even more because the
patient cannot be issued automatic

185
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,409
speeding tickets again

186
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:46,880
jackie jackie is driving 75 miles an
hour they write the answer is No

187
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:57,930
these messages are being broadcast but
they're not even be why do you think the

188
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,930
message

189
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:19,070
of information if nothing else if things
are going about to collide with this car

190
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,399
park settings because there are certain
vehicles that you want to be identified

191
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:32,430
things like police cars fire trucks
ambulances and painted problems but also

192
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:43,030
know if you need to have JavaScript law
he likes to play Metallica maximum

193
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,570
volume can hear the thunder but we can
get notified him to come about and you

194
00:25:48,570 --> 00:26:17,260
know people that are trying to you at
all times are just malfunctioning we

195
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:23,030
have to be able to identify and remove
that the repudiation an early gotta

196
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:28,480
leave the boat so freaked out about
their privacy and public information

197
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,290
the fact is there are may all the way
there or happen to you and your

198
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,340
sensitive information

199
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,840
the program is part of the reason I
thought about beginning about how

200
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,189
vulnerable the system yes it's
introducing new stopper into your cart

201
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,980
it is not necessarily make me any less
secure network that is making more safe

202
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,970
for sure we talk about the pilot project
has been going on in Ann Arbor starting

203
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:07,110
in 2012 and just last year we did a 6000

204
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:15,820
our study of course is a greater in our
area up to $8,000 like it a lot of great

205
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,960
information

206
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,130
the program is a standard no I Tripoli
standard 1609 you're looking up the

207
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:30,309
security and privacy pieces are I could
only see this year IRA mention that

208
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:41,649
pilot New York City 2016 basically going
to be 2017 2018 20,000 be a pilot

209
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:48,080
project in New York City first far as to
roll off the assembly line with what

210
00:27:48,080 --> 00:28:05,850
they are going to be the general motors
català anyone there was one of the

211
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:21,168
better games you got it would be great
but at that point will only be able to

212
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:27,840
look at the forecast job they're not
part of this is the reason that General

213
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,500
Motors Cadillac because of the higher on
this list will add approximately $200 to

214
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:45,010
$250 to our little drunk driving another
$200 no big deal for focus for Casio in

215
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,280
a bit of a budget

216
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,629
the automobile manufacturers are rolling
out the higher parts for us

217
00:28:52,480 --> 00:29:01,559
prices drop down below rhetoric however
the government has already been at their

218
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:09,540
interpretation of a day late last year
and the date by which will be a major

219
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,139
factor

220
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,260
be complying

221
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:26,960
be compliant by 2015 and 2019 taking one
hundred percent by 2020 to secure the

222
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,040
way between now and 2020 to the next six
years the automobile manufacturers are

223
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:42,220
going to start the program slowly mostly
high and there's also a lot of

224
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,910
government interest in the rest of the
software running on your part

225
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:54,150
this is senator mark he received conf
cheeses and it really took up the charge

226
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:02,760
here and you can see the study call
tracking and security gap year old

227
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,100
driver should not have to choose between
being connected and protected so he

228
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:21,439
believed in five acts not the best names
in my opinion but for the security and

229
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,870
privacy in your car I don't know why
they come up with any but Bethany the

230
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:34,540
Act going through right now will become
a lot of your future one of the things

231
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:43,200
that I find it interesting this is last
bullet your desired dashboard features

232
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,940
of it tells you that my four hour how
much you're consuming that they're

233
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,550
recommending for cybersecurity that's
also has to have some type of

234
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,700
attestation security due diligence the
automobile

235
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:07,190
factor in put on the supply and as you
know you don't supply a very broad

236
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,550
always down to you

237
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,730
chipset manufacturers like ZTE
blackberries in office through

238
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:24,270
graders Panasonic AC a larger system
integrators like Delhi Daredevils and

239
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,400
all the way from automotive
manufacturers themselves before the

240
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,670
General Motors the crisis in 2014

241
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:36,290
for the first time that I would more
software engineers hardware engineers I

242
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,490
was a tipping point before another
tipping point that we had in 2015 is

243
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:53,640
there were more than the planet but
nonetheless I recently watched Marvel's

244
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,320
Avengers

245
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:06,689
that pretty good about more connected
than what the order the government is

246
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:13,290
taking out the public key infrastructure
against your vacation and he's gonna be

247
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:19,270
challenged you didn't just football and
communicated its massive absolutely

248
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,020
massive and the witnesses his family
right now so you can call if you choose

249
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:32,190
to accelerator you can choose to filter
messages back the only likely to call it

250
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:45,240
a lot more efficient celery you have the
choice program so many as you have to

251
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,600
have the equipment installed happened to
notify the driver of the automobile take

252
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,020
it further

253
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:59,629
this is why earlier yeah designed so can
stop the car there are so many factors

254
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,650
that we always felt that are planning to
integrate this late

255
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:09,290
the braking system and author of that
automatic vehicle stopped just in a

256
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:14,159
meeting the minimum required to drive it
at the case there are also some

257
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,480
cross-border issues you're the USA and
EU programmes are hardworking practical

258
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,050
the standards are nearly the same but
not quite surprised in the day another

259
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,879
major continuous use it in the USA

260
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,090
transportation to government mandate in
the EU off any program led by the

261
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:43,550
automobile manufacturers themselves very
you're being opposed to systems need to

262
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:52,190
work together because Joe Jonas BMW so
he goes to Munich by the BMW driver few

263
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,990
weeks in the ship it back to the USA
that BMW better work USB devices that

264
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:04,490
organization that were talking about it
and it will then reason for optimism

265
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:15,590
got we've got plenty of interesting
examples know then particularly like

266
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:23,260
threatening but be aware that much much
for even a year ago two years ago and

267
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,659
that's a good thing there are parallels
that we can draw on a party to the

268
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:37,980
actual and the car dealers are finally
being so we can keep calm and we can

269
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:46,870
drive but I want to falsify anything
connected park to the b2b system some

270
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:54,120
details about this what about security
on ya

271
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,160
question for those of you who put in
here as well the insurance companies we

272
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,879
tracking all these speeds the answer for
this program to be programmers know they

273
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:24,850
can always do that for us off into one
of the programs we take double or triple

274
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:28,819
A so the reason that they can't with
this program is because there is no

275
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:37,140
central body of information there's no
there's no local story from Asian black

276
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,810
box in your car for example where ya
just refuse to Castillo they can do for

277
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,970
ethics and look into the program to see
how fast he was going about that

278
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,970
information is not a lawyer for ya

279
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:18,829
again with a killer was my fault
insurance companies offer any to their

280
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:25,599
dog program they could use that won't
worry about not raised according to this

281
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,209
year they were going to get there

282
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:48,430
the arm using GPS primarily the arm
using a higher definition version of GPS

283
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:55,520
quite accurate as you might imagine
because you're talking about high-seas

284
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,180
talking about three dimensions jeff is
going over briefing kathy is going to

285
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:08,690
get no problem there if they if they
refining the empathy but there's

286
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,690
actually a lot

287
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,270
poverty right now there is no
certificate or party in the program

288
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,800
overall the pilot programs whether it's
an arbitrary York City others there has

289
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,710
been one of those of their have not yet
to find a nationwide authority for this

290
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:45,650
program will likely be the government I
think actually probably one of the

291
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:52,910
for-profit organization to get a
contract provision and all the work that

292
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,160
the program has been done by third
parties of the contract with the

293
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:03,080
government so although it will pay for
the double major from a theater

294
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:23,790
but they did

295
00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:01,910
paraphrasing do you think that because
the new airliners and fighter jets at

296
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:07,678
significantly lower number of software
lines in their systems compared to save

297
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,599
up with these is that because they are
writing very efficient software because

298
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:24,089
they are being questioned later be
automobile the 787 Dreamliner had the

299
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:32,349
luxury of rewriting from the ground so
efficiently they were able to start from

300
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:37,400
scratch essentially similar to what they
had to do it and they do have some

301
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,849
pretty darn good engineer in the
automobile world with respect the

302
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:50,729
software though the automobile fragment
is that the folks at Villa braking

303
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:54,339
systems that we don't have a lot of
interacting with the folks of building a

304
00:39:54,339 --> 00:40:01,319
consistent intractable to build each
system as rape you move from mechanical

305
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:07,979
hydraulic manage the late notice
software I think happened with an

306
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:09,839
independent this moment fuel injector

307
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:18,310
and that is part of the problem for the
second part of the question again was

308
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:52,060
other so they can use their own set
their own engineering because they hit

309
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:59,430
the Standard Bank really will be part of
the medical transportation safety

310
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:08,290
standard standard by which all defective
automobiles happy with everything from

311
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:15,390
the show last year back these systems
will be part of that and the right now

312
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,220
the mandate minimum requirement you have
to meet you can meet them however you

313
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:27,520
need to lead them to validate the cats
but there will be two gotta be that you

314
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,920
follow those any transportation safety
standards they're all felt at a station

315
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,210
and many don't realize that the air bags

316
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:43,500
class all the other factors South attack
yes I don't get the ball back and then

317
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,850
there are random pop any automobiles
found to have failed one of those

318
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,750
standards that when they recall anything
that will be part of that
