1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:27,270
so I'm Georgia and I'm lucky to be here
so yeah I have two companies right now

2
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,058
she Vera at the top and bulb security of
the bottoms of products and consulting

3
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,489
not that this is a company of hits her
anything this is totally a hacker talk

4
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:42,620
but you know just in case and he really
wants consulting our products we're

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,400
going to talk about mobile everybody
here as a mobile phone right hands up

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,909
for them oh ok better hands of a few
don't have a mobile if you like my dad

7
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:56,369
my dad just got his first mobile phone
in fact it's a flip phone not much you

8
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,010
know me the ultimate and risk of phone
hacking and my dad doesn't have a phone

9
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,939
it's kind of insulting honest or maybe
he's listening to my talks that are now

10
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,529
I send them to him but I don't know that
he knows how to use YouTube as possible

11
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,600
he has no idea what I they are it's a
little bit more about me is I added the

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,048
slide just today so may not end up in
the final slide deck cuz I already

13
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:25,130
turned it in but I'm from Dec out of
about a month ago so actually I'm from

14
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:31,420
Texas which is like here except not as
timber it so it's hot all the time so I

15
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,470
moved up to do so you for the business
but it's less than a month after I moved

16
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,030
there this is what happens people told
me I should buy food so I did I bought

17
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,270
some food but the night is filed by like
Friday cuz it was like there was all

18
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,840
this food in my house so I just ate it
and then I was stuck into a lake this

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,979
was monday and I file I dug myself out
so you know I've been I guess on the LA

20
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:03,020
starvation diet for the last couple days
so I everything was on site yesterday so

21
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,798
does my house over there was not even in
the picture I mean like the end of the

22
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,980
row I climb out through this anybody use
it over so I thought I was mad at me

23
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,200
because it's like they can only wait for
five minutes and is watching me right on

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,560
the other side of this snow bank rate is
45 minutes is up like in the middle of

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,890
it

26
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,260
and I lost my shoe and I had to dig my
shoes but I made it and I got here so

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,880
you should be glad that I made it
because I could have very easily just

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,990
might get out of my house I'm not coming
but I did alright so that's not very

29
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,459
mobile clearly the snow plow is not at
this time very mobile at all but it's

30
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,450
supposed to be a mobile device but not
right now but actually it is a mobile

31
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,459
device because you can actually get on
the Virginia government site and you can

32
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,530
see where the snow plows are but they
lie to you because they say the snow

33
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,209
plows that are dead or actually they're
like it's like oh you're just about to

34
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:06,750
be plowed all the time when it's dead so
they actually do have like GPS on things

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,420
there but they don't work very well
liked in this picture they die but

36
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,910
anyway

37
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,870
mobile devices right we all have smart
phones except for my dad but is this a

38
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,209
mobile device so this is where it gets
funny right you can barely tell here but

39
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,330
the toilet is actually blew so I think
it's Ryan sister right I said my

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:31,549
presentation I said make everything blew
I didn't realize use the toilet but then

41
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:38,079
I kinda liked it so we have here a blue
toilet but blue or white or whatever is

42
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,489
this toilet a mobile device

43
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,959
well we'd like to hope not right i mean
our basic human instinct about the

44
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,260
toilet we shouldn't have any mobile
things with that well unfortunately

45
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,250
thank the Japanese for this cuz they
gotta make everything and Internet of

46
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,140
Things because there actually is a
toilet mobile vulnerability in the wild

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,700
a particular kind of toilet I haven't
seen any of them over here in the USA

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,630
but our time will come no doubt as we
like it or no other things just as much

49
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,030
as anybody but Trustwave spiral of
anybody trust with our lives here want

50
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,950
to take credit for this but they found
her ability you know every now and then

51
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,599
people get really bitchy on Twitter and
they're like this whole internet at

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,940
things things that's a crock you can
find a vulnerability anything it should

53
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,950
make you famous whatever but this is
cool so a toilet has a hard-coded

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,110
Bluetooth fans so it's a Bluetooth
toilet so anybody within range

55
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,030
can just look up what the pin is I think
it's 0000 according to my slide I was

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,260
gonna say 1111 shows how much I know
anyway according to the vulnerability

57
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,760
airport attackers could cause the unit
to unexpectedly opens fire close the lid

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,000
activate the day or air dry functions
causing discomfort or distress to the

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,070
user I don't know about you but getting
my emails stolen has nothing on new ok

60
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,590
so yeah mobile is here and now at least
in Japan but something a little more

61
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,330
close to home for the time big is this a
mobile device

62
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,140
a car well if you're poor like me know
seriously around here in LA right I was

63
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,210
walking trying to get here you know
eventually had to call a neighbor has my

64
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,099
GPS was like no you cannot walk for
Ocean Avenue to hear forget it I was

65
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,250
trying and homeless people kept talking
to me like I was one of them and I had

66
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,970
my backpack with me you know everything
I brought with me but I I guess you just

67
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,110
hope people we're like really fancy
clothes cuz yeah I apparently was one

68
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,080
step down from your average a homeless
person they wanted to give me money so I

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,560
know you got something going right
anyway for those that have a car if you

70
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,500
have an old car like me and no noble
their abilities but if you have a new

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,420
car this is what might happen to you so
you know we all probably solace that

72
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,340
black out this past year you know
Charlie Miller and all them did this

73
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,530
they broke into the car remotely you
know it's super fancy if you do it

74
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,260
without all the wires into the front of
the car but they did it remotely through

75
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,320
a mobile modem so a lot of the newer
cars no fancy like GPS Sirius radio

76
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,250
thing in the front that's actually an
Android just you know without like the

77
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,720
phone part it has the phone part it even
has a screen for so I guess it's just a

78
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,570
bigger Android but anyway so the Android
to the mobile modem and make the car

79
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:40,150
brakes disabled and things like that it
happens that's a mobile device for sure

80
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,640
so that's the kind of thing we're
actually of potentially dealing with

81
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,719
some ICO that I just heard he has
achieved which is actually the same kind

82
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,240
of car this is but the first thing he
did when he got it he took the radio and

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,380
put a custom radio some really mad at
him because there's free research for me

84
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,680
gone down the tree anyway here's a
mobile device may be right this is like

85
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,470
the idea of what are mobilized with
birthday this is actually my first

86
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,410
international conference ever in Cali
Colombia not Columbia Maryland like

87
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,160
colombia drug lord Columbia that was
interesting but they took us to see this

88
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:25,250
museum where they had tobacco maybe they
grew they're not sure backhoe it anyway

89
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,470
they had this phone I'm like oh my god
it's the archetypal mobile phone but my

90
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,480
guess is this is probably not a mobile
device

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,050
sure I'll leave that up to you
philosophers is this a mobile device

92
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,020
because it didn't have a mobile modem
right so who knows it just cause it to

93
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,820
the main house I guess the slave
quarters who knows so mobile risk to the

94
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,790
problem I have with mobile is pretty
simple mobile devices like to attach to

95
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,550
a lot of different things so who here is
a pin tester deepen toasters keep

96
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,430
investors who here instead of being
Pinterest years we have an easy job I

97
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,090
spent a few years in charge of their
company's security you have the hard job

98
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,989
but she give you cookies

99
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,630
well here are seven hurt when your job
is in fact either as a pinch gesture

100
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,890
because again thanks to Trustwave we all
actually have to do a good job now

101
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,240
because girls will get sued thanks trust
way if our other cool you know is to

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,640
hopefully find all the vulnerabilities
for those of you urban testers know you

103
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,820
know they say you know you can only test
between nine and 10 a.m.

104
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,049
on a Saturday and that's it and you can
only test these specific IP addresses

105
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,020
but again only between nine and 10 on a
Saturday is it forget it if it's

106
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,710
anything else and no social engineering
and no client side and no mobile and

107
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:54,380
yeah that's about it so no wonder we do
it anyway so mobile devices have this

108
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,280
little problem you know we're used to
protecting the perimeter we're all about

109
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,540
the perimeter we buy our fancy next june
firewalls you know fix everything right

110
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,360
they see all that Mauer goin through the
perimeter well maybe not but anyway I

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,380
say that they did well our mobile
devices have additional ways to get out

112
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,990
of the perimeter so I went to this
conference was this really fancy

113
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,310
business conference may have Robert
Herjavec you know the guy from Dancing

114
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,160
with the Stars in the shark tank which I
imagine he probably knows very little

115
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,810
about security because he spent all of
his time you know being famous now I

116
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,560
wouldn't either I made that kind of
money but he kept saying over and over

117
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,020
again his speechwriters anyway told him
to stay at every in point is now your

118
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,189
internet facing systems and that's very
true about mobile is everything about

119
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,890
your phone you got this mobile modem
they have a phone number there basically

120
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,140
internet facing which is kinda scary if
you think about them being on your

121
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,949
corporate network so I see some
corporate networks are like ok we put

122
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,020
all the phones in this phone VLAN for
the gas and things but most places I go

123
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:07,290
to art like that they're just like your
wifi password have fallen so that's our

124
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:14,790
security people so yeah I would too
taxing you know MSO 8067 and you know

125
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:22,480
it's like how many years old now and it
still works no I recently did this job

126
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,420
and they didn't have any Mizzou 8067 and
I was so excited but they had it in

127
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,410
mostar 950 which was a year later but
just as bad show is still going on all

128
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,329
servers so you know they're like nobody
can get to them because they're on the

129
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,850
internal network so there's no bad guys
on the internal network ever know

130
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,120
but what about your phone's rate like
right now seriously one of my people

131
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,009
that I subcontract for made me do this
rate they made me install this like

132
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,069
Chinese App Store and it wasn't even in
scope it was for a different job but

133
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:01,189
there was an Android portion that
without a scope so you know I just had

134
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,990
to like give my phone up basically and
now it downloads to new apps every day

135
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,589
seriously every day I wake up with two
new apps and you know most of it's

136
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,160
written in Chinese but occasionally
there's like a word like a route that's

137
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,579
an English you know I can only assume
what that means and that is why I don't

138
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:25,388
have customer data on my mobile devices
ladies and gentlemen but anyway so your

139
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:30,610
mobile devices are coming in and out of
the network every day probably and their

140
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,209
got direct connections to all the other
devices you know those fancy servers

141
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:39,170
with all the fancy credit card data and
stuff and they can have a direct

142
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,699
connection to them we think these things
are kinda dumb we think there you know a

143
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,519
lot like this guy but they're really not
there really capable of doing all sorts

144
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,920
of things you know they speak tcp/ip
they can throw a message 080 67 just

145
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,680
like anybody else and call out to the
network more about that later

146
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,219
know everybody says there's never been
anybody that was attributed through

147
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,569
their hacks like Target and Sony and all
them it's always social engineering it's

148
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:11,120
never mobile to mobile doesn't matter
eight if we're not attributing attacks

149
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,069
the mobile we shouldn't be spending our
money on it but let's think about it

150
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,810
those you guys here in like intrusion
detection right how much are you

151
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,380
actually looking for around mobile what
you can't see can't hurt you write well

152
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,389
at least you're not gonna get sued like
Trustwave so let's assume for a second

153
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:37,189
that maybe mobile is exploitable like
remote attacks we love remote code

154
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,079
execution right that's like the coolest
thing ever

155
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,800
it's straight out in 2008 that never
happens anymore nobody ever gets removed

156
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,660
code execution on a modern platform
right until this year black when all the

157
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,800
Android devices fell down to stage
fright stage fright is actually

158
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,500
the name of the Android libraries you
know not one of those names like you

159
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,970
know the name of all like sand worm and
in a horse and pig and things like that

160
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,120
for their exploits for this was actually
the androids fall that it was named

161
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,560
stage fright just a little tidbit you
know until you actually start to play

162
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,310
with it doesn't hit very often but
that's another story for another day but

163
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,319
when I like his cell towers so cell
towers are fun you can actually buy

164
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,610
assault her off the internet for pretty
cheap for research purposes for

165
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,600
universities maybe but if you have a lot
of money you can go to some like Middle

166
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,100
Eastern country and get one for a little
bit more expensive that's like prevailed

167
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,680
to exploit stuff but you know nobody
would ever do that right if they have a

168
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,430
lot of money they never just like sit
outside your office with a cell tower

169
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,069
well I said my apartment with the cell
tower people keep telling me the FCC is

170
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,930
going to show up for me one day but yet
they never do have a ham license of ham

171
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,769
radio license so that apparently like
they're in the same bands have made

172
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,860
that's why they don't show up show up
but probably they have better things to

173
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,860
do than just hang out in my apartment my
guesses

174
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,810
televised filter is in these guys pretty
much takes all towers of law you know we

175
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,819
saw years and years ago about the time I
was starting giving talks you know Chris

176
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,649
Paget went and give the talk on him
we're gonna have a cell tower it was all

177
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,740
up in arms with everybody is like that
so you go you're an exploit people's

178
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,360
photos but yeah yeah it happened the
talk occurred and wife went on but

179
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,040
showed what was possible

180
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,339
all you do is jam everybody back to judy
back to the days of Noah security where

181
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:42,529
she told her she said hi I'm so that our
phones is it ok cool we want to get out

182
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,750
and keep our people getting you know
service because that's what they want

183
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,640
people don't want security they want
service you do to it you're stuck on the

184
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:56,899
side of the road trying to get over so
anyway it still works all of your cell

185
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:02,199
towers today will totally dropped back
to to do so we all your phones they want

186
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,620
to stay in service so that's what
they'll do so if I'm a cell tower and I

187
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,050
say hi

188
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,459
error and you can't see anybody who
looks like the right kind of Seoul Tower

189
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,560
I suddenly become the most interesting
looking cell tower your phone very much

190
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,930
wants to talk to me and do whatever I
want it to do anybody here ever been to

191
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,839
China when you got off the plane at
China and turn on your phone what

192
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,390
happened everything updated right you
have a lot of updates of the time it

193
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,269
took for you to get from America to
China it was a very big Patch Tuesday

194
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,480
for your phone

195
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,250
that's a malicious so how're you don't
just happen in china so it can happen

196
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,760
billion can happen I don't watch the
time I tend to be chatty well let's say

197
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,300
for the sake of argument remote code
execution is dead even though we

198
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,130
provided it's not for insiders hacks we
all like that I spend most people of

199
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,910
some kind side attacks when they're like
only between eight and 9 a.m. on a

200
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:10,819
Saturday or browsers PDF viewers mobile
apps are also I mean I've got new apps

201
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,240
every day the tryout I don't even have
to download them anymore it just

202
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,570
download them for me how exciting is
that you know as soon as I accepted the

203
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,170
key for the App Store it can now this
download stuff from iphone willy nilly

204
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,279
if I was in the security person I would
find this particularly awesome I

205
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,510
personally find it pretty terrible but
you know what happens so we've got our

206
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,180
mobile apps the browsers and things like
that we could even calling mobile

207
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,149
protocols for years ago there's like
this USSD thing that happened where it

208
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,649
was like you could make people
automatically dial things from a webpage

209
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:51,459
like killed their phone but was exciting
you know it's really just a matter of

210
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,910
when people get around to discovering
this stuff rate secure coding is hard I

211
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,420
certainly wouldn't want to be in charge
of security adding the internet so we

212
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,389
hid stuff we make it look like you know
a PDF has got an exploit in it or a web

213
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,020
pages can exploit it and they all fall
down as long as people browse starsight

214
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,980
it's really easy to make people drowsy
so it's great you know I have to do it

215
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,770
for my job he'd go to the site and I'd
really rather not

216
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,110
do it anyway if you wanna get paid and
so i browse to it and now I have a

217
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,279
Chinese App Store

218
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,990
social engineering that brings me to
social engineering so I have a very

219
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,950
complicated relationship with social and
you know I used to give a lot of talk

220
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,440
they don't give as many hugs now that
I'm doing the business thing but I gave

221
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,019
a lot of talk to rate you know you have
to get in and be accepted

222
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:47,779
give talks and you have to have a
certain standard supposedly to give a

223
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,539
talk I always felt like the people who
talked about social engineering didn't

224
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:56,549
work for it as hard as I did you know we
got through it and they're like people

225
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:01,840
click on stuff and I was kind of pissed
off honestly I didn't like those people

226
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,389
but I have to take it back I have to say
in front of the world and this video

227
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:11,100
camera that I was wrong about the social
engineering thing social engineering is

228
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,939
the key to all of this is when all of my
stuff starts working you guys' stuff

229
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,769
still hits every time so I would give up
my old days and be sending out SMS fishy

230
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:27,950
named for the rest of my life in penance
if you'd like to do SMS fishing see me

231
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,700
after the chalk yeah they're turning
into a business person who is not

232
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,309
working very well so you know you've
probably seen probably in your

233
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,220
enterprise you have to do the whole
email phishing they like we've got the

234
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,980
fish me stuff and it only makes sense
that a certain something everybody

235
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,289
through social engineering training they
instead like see who clicks on stuff and

236
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:52,289
then make those people take the training
at the time so it sticks in your head

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,570
totally cool right way better than
having to be like don't click on Share

238
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:02,509
don't click on Share anyway but I don't
feel like we're really getting the whole

239
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,440
picture here I feel like there's a lot
more to it than just email

240
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,909
like for instance text messages you know
I started my whole career on text

241
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:17,840
messages I meant to text message botnet
and it made me a star and that was so I

242
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,570
love text messages we will always be
friends particularly because most mobile

243
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,110
phones to actually follow the
specification for text messages which is

244
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,008
also in because when stuff deviates from
specification that's where you get bugs

245
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:33,960
as the people who write specifications
really think about this stuff

246
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,110
the people who are implementing energy
is like Oh whatever you know that's

247
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,379
where you get your interesting bugs
things like near-field communication

248
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,929
right these Near Field Communication tax
I don't feel like they really took off

249
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:50,679
in the USA but in europe seriously you
get in an elevator in a hotel in its

250
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,679
like Near Field Communication everywhere

251
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:02,309
click on his show it because I'm curious
sort who cooks on everything but surely

252
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,830
it's gonna take off here but we like
more here in the USA

253
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,760
those QR codes right we're obsessed I
will never forget one of my first death

254
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,860
comes just sitting on the side of the
road watching people and their asses QR

255
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,408
code right in the middle of like the big
DEFCON saw in the main road and there

256
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:26,580
was like a scavenger hunt and people
thought that the QR code was part of the

257
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,720
scavenger hunt rate it made sense so
they would come up with their phone and

258
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,960
scan it and then you just look of
absolute horror on their faces and it

259
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,210
turned out it was actually somebody ran
ahead just put a QR code that went to go

260
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,510
to you I didn't know what gives he was
at the time but I do now and if you

261
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,250
don't know why I really think you should
not find out and just read about this

262
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,740
talk but anyway so you know you can put
QR codes anywhere in fact there's a

263
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,320
Python library that all you have to do
is imported and a new book QR codes or

264
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,299
script kiddies unite for the QR codes so
we've got some options I think for

265
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,840
social engineering with the mobile that
we didn't necessarily have with our

266
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,350
traditional devices and I think this
interesting and i think is just gonna

267
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,870
get worse with things like the toilets
and no one to go to the gas station now

268
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,039
and it's like you're just wipe your
thing to pay and I'm just like ok so I

269
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,640
think this is just going to get worse in
terms of like anybody can just put up

270
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,549
whatever attack they like of a certain
protocol and your phone will

271
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:35,870
automatically read it if you let it or
prompt you to read it if you're doing it

272
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,678
correctly and probably most of the time
you'll say yes anyway so I really do

273
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,750
think like I said I have to apologize to
the social enjoy

274
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,730
people social engineering is not dead
engineering is alive and well but as in

275
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,680
mobile so what about applications right
to have all else fails why don't we just

276
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,500
give them a nap now I'm living at
purgatory right now because like I said

277
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,520
every day I get to New all they had to
do was when I installed the first half I

278
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,060
accept their signing in all the other
apps come down every day without asking

279
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:15,399
me and I thought so but you know we like
three love them or hate them the very

280
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,480
complicated relationship between me and
apps written that all apps to work for

281
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,740
good rate they never steal stuff from
their own awesome always use ABC news's

282
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:33,010
the example that was on CNN one day and
I used ABC News as the bad out because I

283
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,850
thought it was an ABC news but I was
actually on CNN and it would have made

284
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,209
the maddest you know I was exploiting
someone else they actually liked it a

285
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,240
lot it's really didn't look like I
didn't know it's news program I was

286
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,310
alright then

287
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:52,370
security is hard man so anyway so you've
got a good app why can't we just make it

288
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,790
into a bad you know they all kind of
follows some sort of random ish pattern

289
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:03,570
of how they work you know they have a
file that says all of the classes and

290
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,740
they have all the classes and they have
something that runs first when you

291
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,060
started so you know me as kind of
thinking back to the days when I had the

292
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,490
study algorithms in college and I was
usually asleep or maybe not there is it

293
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,600
was eight in the morning but anyway the
little bit I remember us like could I

294
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,980
write an algorithm that they would do
this for me and sure enough I'm always

295
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,470
surprised when something of mine works
it seems like there should be something

296
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,340
harder to this but sure it off is
actually not that hard to take India put

297
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,970
it back together with your ex troopers
free sign up with all sorts of weird

298
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,270
ques like they've been key
vulnerabilities just sign up with your

299
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,240
key you'd be surprised

300
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,110
getting back to the social engineering
thing like with my Chinese actors like

301
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:53,689
I'm not signed by Google Play only when
I do I just click Yes

302
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,260
so you know probably because you're not
really an issue at all but if they are

303
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,940
there are ways around it

304
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,940
what I like is that you know we see a
lot of getting ahead of myself but like

305
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,580
security stuff for mobile security stuff
I say quotations and this is security

306
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,649
stuff right so it keeps everything on
the domain it runs everything is root it

307
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,470
has all your signing key sitting inside
of it so I get one domain account login

308
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,820
to it grab your shining you sign my
stuff in the story so not too hard so

309
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,100
absurd evil know we've seen a lot with
the security side like you know you're a

310
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,000
plethora tease and like fire I have
something around an hour's wanna say

311
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,790
which absurd good in with your bad but
in my experience with mobile malware the

312
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,520
stuff it looks the scariest is actually
good and the stuff that looks really

313
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,020
scary according to those algorithms is
actually the bad stuff just throws an

314
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,780
exploit after it installs and doesn't
need any of that quote unquote scary

315
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,990
stuff so I think it's a really hard
question about what makes good and what

316
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,370
makes bad around out and we should
assume they're all bad for the sake of

317
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,500
security that's really the only way
we're going to win this they're all evil

318
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,800
we have evil devices in our enterprise
is really what it comes down to this guy

319
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,570
walks in your enterprise he's evil we
need to deal with him as an evil actor

320
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,850
and I feel like we can do this I feel
like we can do with evil actors have we

321
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,159
just treat them as such

322
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,050
instead of trying to save it they're
good so we've got an evil actor what's

323
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,330
this evil actor gonna do so he's gonna
wanna steal stuff from us well his first

324
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,909
target is this guy that he's already on
why not steal everything we have here

325
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,820
again we get into those who like
security for mobile things that's like

326
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,090
us in box on this now how does the root
exploit man I can look right in memory

327
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:51,580
of your data and all your data falls
down so I hate all security controls for

328
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,570
mobile I think that they don't work well
in off which the only way they're gonna

329
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,780
start working well enough as we start
saying that the stock and fixing them

330
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,090
here that's how all security controls
were so that's what we gotta do a

331
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,970
security people say you know you're
doing this well but you're doing this

332
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,500
release

333
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,960
gotta fix it instead of destroying I
can't control if you take one thing when

334
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,530
the stock it's that you have your
security controls your enterprise is

335
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,780
paying a lot of money for you need to
start thinking about what they're really

336
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,100
providing you and what they're not
they're providing you a lot of things

337
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,510
but some of the things I say they're
providing you maybe they're not

338
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,400
providing you and it is up to you guys

339
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,010
no amount of me standing up here and
going no security controls is going to

340
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,520
work is going to be you guys so they're
also going to control the device failure

341
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,430
to send out stuff on the behalf of the
device like text messages or post to

342
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,180
Twitter or talk to other devices in the
enterprise when it shows up in the

343
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,450
Enterprise IT has direct access to
things that privilege escalation I'm

344
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,140
pretty much all your mouth where that
remotely sophisticated does this is just

345
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,960
a dozen ask for any permissions or
anything like that to tip off your appt

346
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,710
thority is it instead just throws an
exploit after gets on device and then

347
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:16,230
it's got full privileges and their needs
and my very favorite mobile pivoting so

348
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,540
in addition to talking to other devices
can actually exploit other device list

349
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,970
which is awesome I think because again
we're putting all of our security around

350
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,300
the perimeter that's where we spent all
our money it's like ok you still on my

351
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,860
credit cards on the inside but if it
can't get out that doesn't do you any

352
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,439
good so we're going to stop it at the
perimeter and then everything will be

353
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,070
fine

354
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,960
those were spending most of our money
but if like Robert Herjavec

355
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,070
speechwriters said where instead
actually having every device via mobile

356
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,679
in point then all of money we spend on
the perimeter is now basically you /

357
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,760
against our hardcore attackers his they
can spit out again these guys are

358
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,200
basically internet facing they can call
out through their mobile modem or you

359
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,580
know we seem weird stuff through the
research community that may or may not

360
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,770
have been true like but it's a cold out
via sound so bad BIOS no I don't know if

361
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,560
that was true but I do know that the
attack vector is completely legitimate

362
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,159
you can on a mobile device at least
catch things via sound

363
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,400
and make a phone call in the background
and since stuff like basically have its

364
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,760
peak the text on the other side so it
could totally work this geyser really

365
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,480
kinda creepy so you know traditionally
this would be what happened one device

366
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,650
speaks to another device we've got one
device has exploited the talks to an

367
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,140
unexploded device and naturally
exploited it if you guys who were in

368
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,840
charge of security in your enterprise or
your pen tester you know there's going

369
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,810
to be something that's exploitable
around here if you've got any size

370
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,620
enterprise whatsoever

371
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,159
we're gonna have some stuff that isn't
giving patch you know please patcher

372
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,980
stuff I don't know why you don't but you
don't in the ferry so we're gonna get

373
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,910
something you know it's going to be an
easy win it's not even gonna be that

374
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,740
hard

375
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,080
something's gonna get hit its gonna go
out through the perimeter it is going to

376
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,070
bypass your perimeter controls let's
face it it's not really that hard all

377
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,629
the money we're throwing out you know we
just get the same thing and get past it

378
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,400
and if we can do it really too bad guys
can cause they have more money and more

379
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,920
skill at face it you know we're not that
cool compared to them so it gets out to

380
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:33,870
its attacker but it gets a little more
scary again what does this do it

381
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,199
bypasses your perimeter entirely so even
if your perimeter controls are stopping

382
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,960
things suddenly this doesn't make it
matter anymore because it calls out via

383
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,390
in in point put bypasses all of your
controls because it's cooked coming

384
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:54,610
through the mobile modem only works I
did something like this just to prove

385
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,959
that I could again I'm really surprised
by anything of mine works because it's

386
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,600
not particularly sophisticated it's just
like me in stackoverflow trying to

387
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,490
figure this stuff out so when it works
I'm like wow the attackers much really

388
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,710
have it easy if I got this to work in
like a day so you know that's what I do

389
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:18,100
I prove that attacks work so yeah it
works like if you want to watch a video

390
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,040
of it look at Sky doggone I sent on a
shell from unexploited machine to a

391
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,990
phone on the podium with me to the cell
tower to the other phone on the other

392
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,250
side and it picked back up on my left
and I did this at a conference

393
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,210
network ladies and gentlemen you guys
should know how hard that is like if it

394
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,200
were gonna conference where all you guys
are doing all sorts of nonsense you know

395
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,270
it's gonna work so this is what your
attackers are probably doing in your

396
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:48,490
enterprise every time you let a phone in
which you share we've got mobile

397
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,530
security controls enterprise mobility
management unfortunately the people who

398
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,840
are buying the on enterprise mobility
management are generally and offs though

399
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,520
they want to say look fever all the
phone these are all the phones that are

400
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,180
here and they have a long list of
security things they do you know they're

401
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,600
getting towards doing them well you know
if you think back think about Lake

402
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,520
firewalls like before they go all fancy
vs in map you know we got your port

403
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,250
scanner versus your firewall and it was
like a war for ages and distill or for

404
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,780
ages and firewalls got better because
things like in that kept hitting them

405
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,510
that's what we're not doing around this
mobile enterprise management or mobile

406
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,710
device management or whatever we're
calling it today like we had to change

407
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:39,050
the name from India that was like medium
data whatever I don't know there was

408
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:43,620
another indium so they had the turned it
in Gartner's handout image but anyway so

409
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,300
that's what we're not doing they
basically just okay these are the things

410
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,770
that we think are the problems were
going to fix them so we don't really

411
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,110
know what the problems are mobile and we
don't really know if these things fixed

412
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,189
them any verse is eternally example of
this rate I mean say what you will about

413
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,080
antivirus know is not going to fix your
virus problem but it is gonna fix your

414
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,760
like notable easy found everywhere virus
problems like my mom download the game

415
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,610
and it has a virus in it

416
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,990
Antivirus is going to pick it up and
kill it well or at least is gonna

417
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,030
disable the antivirus and that's gonna
let me know that there's a virus and I

418
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:25,190
need to kill it so it does its job is
job is just kinda overblown the fact

419
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,290
that you obviously can't fix the virus
problem but you know we have Mobile

420
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,250
Antivirus it tries to do the same thing
right it's like I'm gonna find the noon

421
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,900
viruses on the phone but the way the
phone is set up it's like apps camps

422
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,190
each others like private files or smoke
like your windows

423
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,580
of the days passed and even now so it
can't see anything here Mobile Antivirus

424
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,330
has basically you could we do antivirus
on mobile phone but people are spending

425
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,029
tons of money on the one we've got so
why would we so you know it's up to us

426
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:58,500
to security people to fix this

427
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,470
we are to talk about data containers
yeah you destroy a rude actually pulling

428
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:08,879
out of memory you know this happened
like 2009 2010 still people are buying

429
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:13,289
data containers and platforms and this
is a black phone too thanks for Chrome

430
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:16,990
for giving me the free phone exploited
it with a Chinese App Store it doesn't

431
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,789
care but it's not designed to care it's
up to me as the user to make it strong

432
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:27,139
so I mean there are hardened platforms
but you know it's really up to I mean I

433
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:31,508
can make a hardened platform today and
say yeah georgia's hardened platform is

434
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:37,019
it you guys to tell me whether it is or
not I have time to do all of them and of

435
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,490
course data loss prevention of the
perimeter is not going to fix a mobile

436
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:46,019
device problem it could totally fixed
only just wifi problem but bring in the

437
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,330
mobile modems and that's what we gotta
do right we gotta see where were out

438
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,000
with mobile devices enterprise and you
might not have mobile problems you might

439
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,730
have you know no mobile devices or no
only blackberries and let's face it

440
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:07,009
there too hard jury API calls for for
any money and make our four but you

441
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,190
probably have a lot of iPhone than
Android they probably are all over the

442
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,270
place

443
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,009
let's face it that's probably what's
going on so we need to see you know what

444
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,579
the state is particularly for spending
money on mobile security controls we

445
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:23,240
need to see whether they're really
providing value is I'd hate to see you

446
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,859
guys spend your money on stuff that
isn't providing you value when you could

447
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:33,310
be spending it on me I guess that put
you to sleep because that was funny that

448
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,578
was funny you know I'm not very funny
but that was funny

449
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:41,450
like for instance just like running a
malicious applications like nothing sees

450
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:46,348
it like what have I paid for this so I
mean I've got some examples here you

451
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,399
know do a jailbreak jailbreaking is
interesting right because it's like all

452
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,049
the jailbreak protection although I'll
do a CCD are super years

453
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,750
was actually in a talk again at a
business conference to these are not

454
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,450
busy technical guy is somebody puts of
us have it all you have to do is change

455
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,569
the suf to issue 1 and it didn't see me
anymore

456
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,360
security dreams are awesome so yeah
it'll catch the people who want to

457
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,990
exploit their phones because they can be
cool but it won't catch the bad guys

458
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,160
because they don't care about her super
user they've got what they want with the

459
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,839
root shell so yeah it happens so rarely
is up to you guys are gonna have to fix

460
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,850
his mobile home cuz I can't do it alone
time for damage caused I talk too much

461
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:37,529
but questions to ask so naturally you
guys may want to ask me some questions

462
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,000
but I actually have some questions that
you may want to go back and ask so you

463
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,670
gonna be like I went to this thing and
you guys paid for it so you want your

464
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,880
money's worth so here's your money's
worth ray here asking these questions

465
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,570
your operations team about your mobile
security right now it is not give you a

466
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,760
jumping off point about you know this
mobile thing that we do so you probably

467
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,300
got a mobile problem you probably know
you have a mobile problem I don't really

468
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,750
know what to do with it

469
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,060
everybody always asks me like ok what do
I do about it

470
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,040
any answer is right now really not much
but that's actually the problem I'm

471
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,840
trying to solve tried to make it such
that you actually do have something you

472
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,210
can do here and it's not by making an
Indian that works

473
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,610
sure well you know if somebody would
write an Indian that worked that would

474
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,880
be awesome but they don't have the PR
and marketing department that your big

475
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,350
players like MobileIron and you know
those other big ones now should probably

476
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,810
say more than one so they don't think
I'm picking on them with another big in

477
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,120
the end they're watching us the other
big those who have a big marketing

478
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,390
departments have you make an Indian that
works

479
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:47,770
gonna get completely destroyed by those
people with a big marketing department

480
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,960
is again for the same reason you have no
way to tell which ones do well and which

481
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,090
ones don't know the ones with the big
marketing departments are going to win

482
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,550
until we fix this problem so I don't
think we're gonna fix the problem by

483
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,470
making an MDM that works we're gonna fix
this problem by giving us a way to find

484
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,788
out whether we have a mobile problem
what our mobile problem

485
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:11,119
is and how we can fix it and how our
solutions right now are failing to fix

486
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,719
it so that's my whole thing you know
just something to go away with the sides

487
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:23,539
are gonna be up and you wanna contact me
this is made and I have cards look at me

488
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:27,910
being all professional actually remember
to bring my cards so I need to give you

489
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:38,969
some time to ask me questions I'm a
little out of breath question so my

490
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:44,269
mobile device framework so I gotta
dermagraph like two and half years ago

491
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:50,589
to do mobile security testing framework
where did you open source but i'm not

492
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:55,900
the best quarter ever so you know people
like the problem with open sources like

493
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,049
you gotta get more people to help you
with it and I can totally understand why

494
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:05,038
people didn't cause I'm not the best
coach ever but you know it kinda like I

495
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,529
guess paves the way and now I'm product
Isaac it so now we've got real

496
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:14,189
developers so now I think a lot of the
other Rome is that even in like you're

497
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:21,879
very hackers in trick even consulting
programs they want like a real name

498
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,539
behind it like Metasploit becoming
Metasploit pro league from her

499
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:28,900
perspective that makes no sense
whatsoever is like you've already got

500
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,609
this thing where you paying all this
money to make this thing again but like

501
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:36,569
for people to buy it even if it's
hackers center consulting firms they're

502
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:41,739
gonna buy Metasploit pro they may still
use Metasploit free in the background as

503
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:46,079
the hackers but they've got Metasploit
pro to show their people in the end that

504
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,499
they're not being crazy with this silly
open source tool so I did make a product

505
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:56,828
an open source project and it still out
there so you know you can go on and off

506
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:01,849
get hub and you know I encourage you to
do so I mean much of it still works I am

507
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:06,989
product Isaac you know we're raising a
seed round and all that right now but so

508
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:10,189
I'm gonna make it so that you know
everybody can do this you know we're

509
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:14,759
looking for pilots you know people who
realize they have this problem in a make

510
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:20,079
its kinda more of a legitimate tool you
know even in Napoli went one gentleman

511
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,959
eventually sure you know that's the
state of the framework is that we're

512
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:28,390
trying to go legitimate with fake real
backers and the kinds of things that

513
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,930
you're in a rises would hopefully be
interested in buying as opposed to like

514
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:37,140
what's this weird stuff on the get that
falls down sometimes that's the state of

515
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:45,618
things I guess the board you all the
tears right after I dug myself out of

516
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,619
that snow bank should get here

517
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,180
alright we'll figure out her having out
if no one hit KO
