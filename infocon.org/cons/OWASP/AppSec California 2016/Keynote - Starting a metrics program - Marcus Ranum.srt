1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:26,300
talk about something incredibly boring
which means another try to make it look

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,539
pretty exciting exciting the idea you
know you're trying to get people excited

3
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:38,510
about the metrics to see more to be on
the beach playing volleyball is is kind

4
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,250
of difficult but that's what I'm talking
about it's hard enough measures much all

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,829
of 2015 they all the talks that I've
done in a recent one is that security

6
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,309
practitioners really need to understand
the value of nitric see how they can be

7
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:59,589
used to communicate until I'm just
absolutely sick to death of talking

8
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:04,849
about it on security checkpoint security
is absolutely horrible I I think it's

9
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,820
gotta do you know the classics or
whatever

10
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,080
getting people coming into their meeting
in Jakarta for state and smoking a cigar

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,460
and they go I'm getting chest pains
doctor what you doing ago dole needs

12
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,490
much red meat don't smoke and go ahead
with its plan be that is in point

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,869
security and then not show we can do all
kinds of things to make their endpoints

14
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:35,159
secure just being actually discussion of
what is he forces what is convenient is

15
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,060
really critical topic of measures to see
that nice I tried to further but but

16
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,490
frequently when you're talking to manage
you need to be able to explain why you

17
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,798
want to do something is not doing
something we're opposed to doing

18
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,530
something else is very very frequently I
see security practitioners will run into

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,909
people who go you know I don't know how
to talk to the business soon this is how

20
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:05,689
you talk to the business you not here as
a robert mcnamara as metrics wall was

21
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:12,358
saying he had the security little body
is just horrible stuff you know when you

22
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:17,690
read the media about computer security
the media seems to think that how many

23
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,300
records were stolen in breeding Jesus
interesting metric and interesting

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,000
measurable how bad a security disaster
and you think about that quietly for

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,420
just a couple seconds to realize it
completely useless pieces right and

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,209
that's really part of the problem people
don't think about this problem

27
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,070
measures effectively and as you know
Lord Kelvin John Thompson said

28
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:46,840
measure is and so one of the questions I
like to think about what is the unit of

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,930
measure it you that you keep your
security knowledge it's it's a unit in

30
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,510
fact if you remember nothing from this
except the receipt for your particular

31
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,609
unit of measure that that's probably
what is your attention I don't know it's

32
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,060
going to be very specific to you to be
specific to what it is that you do

33
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:18,060
you're responsible for breaches
something to do with breaches responses

34
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,680
response cause of all the effort around
so I don't know if I can sit here not

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,280
not really any understanding of your
specific problem and just how rattled

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,060
off a couple of that he can to so let's
get let's get into it we'll talk about

37
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:45,970
the electric slide you wanna do this and
so forth right so he's always used to

38
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,940
say things and proceed from there
because this is a definition I like to

39
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,950
use its initial definition

40
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,829
constructed you think about process
process is how to reproduce a metric

41
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,319
that's useful means it's telling some
part of the story that's how your metro

42
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,569
pcs it's all right and that's a place
where security practitioners slowed down

43
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:18,570
a lot we go and visit you guys just
below right biased because getting this

44
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,810
is not a single unit of measurement to
them but if you tell down we're gonna

45
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,220
get penetrated its receptor likely I
can't tell you how much better tell me

46
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,490
it contradicts 368 I was an unexpected
jump now you get your attention I put

47
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,930
that he would get a measure that the
business guy he's going to understand so

48
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,169
he worked for Acme widgets you make
widgets I saw me suspect you're gonna

49
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,849
wanna tell u security story in terms of
how do we get production line is going

50
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,880
to be affected by that text offer over
the period indicated that makes you is

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,850
in the process of getting ready to go
right and that works so it's a means of

52
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,970
reducing some of outdated tell some kind
of story it's crucial here to be honest

53
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:15,470
I B three can be useful ways educating
somebody or you can tell you can tell a

54
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,820
lie under big fan of not selling

55
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,080
wise I find you be tortured people
better with the truth and you can't buy

56
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
love me and you can manipulate better
but the truth is the truth is kind of

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,110
understandable as long as you're between
your side you don't actually have to lie

58
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:41,850
and that brings up a sub corollary which
is it you don't have this problem so so

59
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,680
why are you he really wanted to show for
succeeding corollary to that is to show

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,780
never seen it happen yet but sunday and
you did it is you know someone who does

61
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,469
this let me know because I wanna like
bill with bronze statues the person I

62
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,320
want to see someone got its a metrics
about our security process and they

63
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,770
indicated you should probably fire I
think that would be so badass right

64
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,349
since I took over this position our
security incident rate has gone through

65
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:21,780
the roof and it's my fault but I do you
actually could see someone's so you

66
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,919
could show that your family that's not
such a great thing probably are natural

67
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,600
inclination is just called confirmation
bias toward actually inclination

68
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,200
survivorship bias 2000 you like to lean
towards but aren't actually that issues

69
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,599
to find the truth is the most powerful
to ourselves which he had already gotten

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,020
it clearly shows a lot about that I I
don't want you to think about telling

71
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,510
the truth about love your metrics and
you should understand that you have a

72
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,099
national built-in predilections why so
there's no need to go out of your way to

73
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,080
television Eliza tell the truth is you
see it because it's probably already

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,620
salts there's nothing wrong with that
knowledge that

75
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,310
right while so we did is we want to
justify their existence we want to

76
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,610
justify our budget

77
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,070
the reason for keeping metrics is wrong
however this is not the right field see

78
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:21,969
you might want to argue for change right
now just a point here just was joking

79
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,460
with us if you want metrics raw power
this isn't the right feel free if you

80
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,250
think about it these points making here
are the antithesis of raw power and

81
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,580
authority authority does need to justify
itself authority doesn't need to explain

82
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,940
it so so weird to security practitioner
room full of people and some of the guys

83
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,469
business you're proposing to do
something stupid like shortcut the QA

84
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,330
cycle on a critical procs right

85
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,820
proposing to do some things you're happy
with Lori neither I that they're trying

86
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,099
to argue with the authorities to the
executive in which they make that

87
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,010
actually say they don't have to justify
themselves one of the things you need to

88
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,729
remember when you get in these battles
narrative surrounding some sort of thing

89
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,380
to do with security the other person
also have to justify themselves any kind

90
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:17,539
of get to that later but I will be sold
is about to various you've got guys who

91
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,919
are following a unicorn colored smoke up
someone's backside when they say if we

92
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,859
do this we're going to make all this
money for acne we could stop home we're

93
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,490
going to open lines of we do you only
let us get this piece of crap next week

94
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:41,740
on schedule I did not do anyway and you
have your charity your person is how do

95
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,620
you know that they're lying because
they're basing their projections and

96
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,690
sometimes an extrapolation that's their
life they don't know for sure that

97
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,680
that's what's going on

98
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,099
so one of the things that you need to do
is 190 their claims down to the floor

99
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,370
and say okay so your claim is that we're
gonna make all of this money that's

100
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,410
great let's do a review in here she has
a natural that's the sound of someone's

101
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:15,029
career in the city because I do believe
that businessmen business practices are

102
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,470
moral issue how you carry on with your
co-workers

103
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,040
only issue that you need to think about
very serious so I'm gonna try to divide

104
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,670
between population arguing the improper
reasons are doing something at LMC

105
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,579
improperly his argument arguing that our
weapon I should regularly against you I

106
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,850
suggest you do not go to the dark side
and use the techniques or Darth Vader

107
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,149
you will be home but it's it's good to
know those sorts of things I'll tell you

108
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:47,360
I'll tell you another one is an old
saying which is success as many parents

109
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,180
and failure is an orphan right so here's
one technique that works well let's see

110
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,150
if you're in that he knows something
incredibly stupid that you think is

111
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,140
going to be it is so the first thing you
should do so that's incredibly seated I

112
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,650
think that's going to use a bad person
I'm not actually really with you should

113
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,760
you should grab hold of lights a stupid
idea is to be a disaster

114
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,050
explain the facts clearly concisely not
as you can put them out there if you're

115
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,349
a nasty person to complete that what
you're suggesting is that all of our

116
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,620
critical customer data to the cloud with
no controls on it all and you should go

117
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:33,420
let's do that you can sleep later but if
they succeed you their support for all

118
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,390
along from the get-go and if they failed
you

119
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,210
you are in a position to be the person
to identify the inevitable failure and

120
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,950
begin to raise red flags behind their
back about it as things go forward so

121
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:53,450
don't ever just jump on something in my
shoes you know bad moral person to stop

122
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,950
that they're so when he argued for
change

123
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,330
best thing we did you can presented just
off the top and to make up example here

124
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:11,310
just a sliver public but that's what I
have to do so you know we were cracking

125
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,949
wages and what you might use you might
want to say you know we've been we've

126
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,690
been monitoring stuff and we had to
bring down three times because of our

127
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,830
control systems we shall be brought the
production line because the malware

128
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,060
three times a century brought the
production line down because the city

129
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,180
thousands we just meeting fact you could
do that cost benefit analysis I think

130
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,199
it's a bad idea to be considered doing
what was wrong the control points

131
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,270
control the week we just take that 320
we see that dollar figure this you just

132
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,069
computing that might always another
critical point here we're talking

133
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,700
executives you don't need to compute
everything out the dollars we have been

134
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,750
doing it for sex we want to see if you
actually appeared in Malaysia sunny and

135
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:10,630
evil they're not seeking any executive
you want to talk about the alternative

136
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,110
minimum tax's exercised stock options
right now

137
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,640
work that into the strawberries without
bleeding and then so when you're going

138
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,810
no I can't expect that person to
memorize a six digit password

139
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,130
here every guys throughout history to
get out of doing the laundry just the

140
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,800
first family wife nice was used with
your jeans and ruin it you're offline

141
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,899
retail for upper right it's the same
thing at the executives do they remember

142
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,430
the password on the complete security
and they just themselves exempted from

143
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:57,019
security really answer totally honest
person you wanna get fired quickly when

144
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,589
the executives as I can remember digit
password is you know I'm gonna have to

145
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:07,250
write a letter to the Board of Directors
or CTO its completely more could you

146
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:14,390
possibly remember and then it comes back
to my career I can say things like that

147
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:21,529
to people because down anyways if I want
to go out with most epic thing ever I

148
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:30,779
didn't say things they banks and
brokerages and stuff we do these people

149
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:36,470
getting away with crap for way too long
we collectively and letting them get

150
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,339
away with it can be an example of what
i'm talking to a guy who was a big bang

151
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:47,110
that has I think it's almost a half of
them point so we were talking about the

152
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,610
endpoint security and I had suggested
that they might want to actually control

153
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,760
the runtime inquirer

154
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,480
we still locked down this is don't need
a dynamic software load out and this is

155
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,829
where all the time goes to be on set now
or you could just divided into you know

156
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,010
the studio screwed

157
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:23,470
in order to the street people people and
he said I should be hard to six as I

158
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:31,990
have one of those black iPhone will ship
was 24 million whitelisted devices in

159
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:39,670
one day it's not hard just like ok I see
things and get the people he's gotta for

160
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:51,020
me not to have her for example you can I
could actually this is tired of talk

161
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,600
this one slide you know I have but it's
really poor this is the poverty line and

162
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,140
you can learn everything you need to
know about building metrics off of this

163
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,360
one metric know how the poverty line met
restated

164
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,010
nobody I did when I started I was trying
to come up with a critical metric

165
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,939
vacancies a lot because I knew that
underlie its probably old who recently

166
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,280
got some BS and I was right so the way
this is breeding stock during the Dust

167
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,520
Bowl during the depression there was a
young lady who worked for the Department

168
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,300
of Agriculture who is trying to figure
out how bad things were and what she did

169
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,599
is she figured out based on the color or
import is a cover for more Google Alert

170
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,730
requirements for a farm worker she
gently into the story came over the one

171
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,200
that will make use of what somebody that
social class so let's say you got fifty

172
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,460
go out there farmers he 2,200 calories
per day so she came up with a 69 years

173
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:57,600
for under 400 calories per day went to
the store and cost of making the right

174
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,320
decision is yet that they think it's
gone all costs $5 a person is not making

175
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,010
an average of five dollars per day comes
out at 35 bucks per week in below the

176
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,569
poverty line which means that they
cannot so they cannot feed themselves

177
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,460
right now

178
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,820
what relevance does that have to do we
have to do some persons factory

179
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,720
cappuccino mocha lattes and you know
pizza right which is you know which is

180
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,440
right but it's actually not a bad metric
what happened courses in italy became

181
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,550
politicized why did become politicized
became politicized because it tells the

182
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,020
story you tell us whether the country as
an overall the economy and the working

183
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:46,819
class of course he wanted to see the
working class what you should probably

184
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:54,330
do Saturday 1% our fully happen if you
found the one percent 1% people below

185
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:02,610
the poverty line double Windsor how you
calculate this so this is just a fairly

186
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,690
simple example of how it goes love
things I like about it is it comes back

187
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:14,650
to assume this is it so to stop 2009
16:11 started this particular version of

188
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,290
each other each usually go back to the
nineteen thirties that would show is a

189
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,980
steady steady rampant fantastic problems
were critical point about lying about

190
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,130
charts anytime you're looking at church
or the first thing you should do is look

191
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,210
at the acts she sees the access of
ground in 20 if you're looking at high

192
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,670
church so long to all tell you about
that later but ok so he asked me to an

193
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,370
executive pastor a church usually should
look at them and try to emulate my

194
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:51,550
friends twelve year old daughter ok so
somebody asked to help I'd just go

195
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,909
why did you just put your hair or I
could slowly rolled your own

196
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:06,390
actually a really good imitation sheep
shearing machine is here and the reason

197
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:15,740
is because of white churches shooting
units based off of your access you have

198
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,740
to wonder why did they particularly pic
1969

199
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,360
because this was probably need during
election year this is what I highly

200
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,270
recommend but only get to see here vital
recommended to you I have random law

201
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,700
book recommendations made what he
accomplished this is how it works I

202
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,250
recommend a book to you go then it was
on to block you do not like the book

203
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,080
trying to be contacted

204
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,860
very easy to get Google you get my cell
phone number call me at four o'clock in

205
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,709
the morning

206
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:55,520
recommended I hate all say thank you for
waking you but city to get a bus I will

207
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,539
refund your money because if it ever
happened which is never happened in this

208
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,500
dream sequence you find it but not
valuable you are clearly clueless

209
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,730
appreciate that book and you get my 15
bucks ok so the book talking about

210
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,770
General Hospital I was statistics Dar el
beautiful stations I forget his name

211
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:25,240
get out of the 50 bucks doesn't have
complex now it's beautiful book it's

212
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,860
blowing you can get it to go twelve year
old daughters twelve-year-old daughter

213
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:35,270
watches the upcoming election cycle just
lied right it's a brilliant book and it

214
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,510
shows you all the way sick people in
line with statistics you will be unable

215
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,020
to watch video afterwards because you
see all of this is like the fallacy of

216
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:51,879
the missing actually no it doesn't
actually write the whole weekend 20 here

217
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,970
right but one of the things that you
could do if you're trying to either

218
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,270
statistics things off in 10 percent
effective usually magnifying fluctuation

219
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:06,080
to try to put down more and I think the
left hand side when the republicans all

220
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:17,399
right but anyway so this is a really
useful 11 things go back to the holy

221
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:23,080
Shiite metrics is the way that it's
calculated has been changed over and

222
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,639
over and over and over again says i cant
number

223
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,510
firstly this metric now adjusted for
inflation adjusted for changes in the

224
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,990
workplace nowadays just below the
poverty line if you can't afford

225
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,429
Internet services making which puts all
of us in rural Pennsylvania

226
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:46,240
automatically below the poverty line
because Verizon sucks but they changed

227
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,419
the way to the sector and one of the
interesting things if you produce

228
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,669
long-term important metric like this you
have to be able to explain how do you

229
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:59,320
think of the new changes or back
propagated across all metric and so

230
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,658
here's how you do that I'm just to tell
you right up front with you as you keep

231
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:07,860
your old way keep your letter anyway and
if you're metric is more or less good

232
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,949
what you're going to see is that the new
way she intends to reveal more or less

233
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,700
the same stuff is your order something
wrong with your or there's something

234
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,620
wrong with your old metric right very
simple example of a metric that I

235
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,059
actually did used to use I ran into
digital equipment Corporations Law

236
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,658
handful of internet connections back in
the late nineteen eighties when I switch

237
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,780
to the firewall and we justified that
one line with his expenses

238
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,820
lower bucks a month we justify that team
on line in terms of what we were out

239
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,060
reaching the customers and so what we
did to the metrical customer outreach

240
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,270
was in terms of how many girls we've
pushed into that out of the firewall and

241
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,850
how many FB pieces done from customers
fully documentation stuff like that

242
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,560
firewall and so you know that's actually
pretty good and so we just show that

243
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:09,120
what you started to get more interesting
a lot of the stuff with you see you

244
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,189
remember UCP

245
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:20,640
ok she's so that would be a great metric
and when I could use a good show how it

246
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,710
kinda went up through the floor and 1985
right you know what I did is it was

247
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,290
county in terms of benefits which is
what I was coming out count rows of data

248
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:39,070
were sending that is probably not that
that's shifted over to customer contact

249
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,350
and then I would start to get right back
to cut about where I love being honest

250
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:52,080
what I would do or I would change the
numbers and the makeshift combined line

251
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,500
so unlike say you know you see traffic
traffic traffic in 1995 and web traffic

252
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,680
will come jump off the screen to see
bill down to the toilet and then I we

253
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,050
should also showed a really important
thing should we were on the ball like

254
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:13,320
catching an internet thing that HUP
thing in time right or what I'd like to

255
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:24,179
show that the HP thing all that right
next to set up a website until 2000 and

256
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:32,150
then I would show that we completely
this fire me a marketing guy ok so how

257
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,440
should I haven't measured how do you
cope with something that is relevant to

258
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,800
you

259
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,290
clue number one don't ask your box don't
see that the only thing you don't want

260
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,870
to do he don't want to ask you what are
the top 10 metrics I should keep stuff

261
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,629
about metrics I get a steady flow of
journalists to email me and and the

262
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,100
deadline is always next Wednesday by the
way of knowing if we all just driver

263
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,600
told journalists I'm you least a month
that deadline and conditions of the

264
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,320
offer though I am delighted article next
week basically what you write it for me

265
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:13,310
it's about metrics just tell me what are
the top 10 this is this guys and go we

266
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,330
should keep your we get production line
because I'm the Sydney right when the

267
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,949
worst part is active which it and so it
should be just as relevant to use is

268
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,150
that right

269
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,590
know so there is actually no top 10
batters you should keep their isn't

270
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,709
there simply isn't theirs so this is a
big problem for vendors because look

271
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,940
better she do they can provide the
engines that collect the underlying data

272
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,280
that you need everything that they do
you should collect the underlying data

273
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,660
that you need to run it up don't know
their business once you got your own

274
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:54,110
this is doing the same thing they cannot
possibly know comes like to know if you

275
00:24:54,110 --> 00:25:01,250
could say what measures should I keep
your bosses should she could go well

276
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:10,220
that's what I heard you say I don't know
what metrics job is your job is what

277
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,960
your metrics measure so if you don't
know what you mean you don't know what

278
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,890
success is failure in your job all we
just kinda like voicing the fire fire

279
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,710
red flag which is OK do that if you want
to talk about how department was

280
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,470
established so how do you know this is
the first question i like it

281
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:41,820
ICU the head of the incident was
launched he would pay I'm guessing your

282
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,100
metrics that something to do with it
said you might go so far

283
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,790
afternoon and down your metrics about
his you might go so far as to couple how

284
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,350
are you a response process interfaces
with the Acme widgets

285
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:03,409
production process now you have migrated
from being the head of the incident

286
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:09,040
response process to doing what the CSL
she did write the CSO she's talking

287
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,210
about how the incident response
processes impacted negatively or

288
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,530
positively

289
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,090
production that's the CSO's job down the
trenches you're just talking about how

290
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:25,490
fast he is responsible for shipping so
he's taking examples is that right one

291
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,510
of the things that might happen and then
that somebody businesses proposes to do

292
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:36,720
so we just something that's right so

293
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:46,740
seating and they tell you we just also
acquired 10 2010 which is better we're

294
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:54,280
opening a Chinese city of Shenzhen okay
and then that's this is not something

295
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,020
you had in the eighties it's going to
happen right so what you might get you

296
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,470
might say that's great we'll get back to
the week with some projections about how

297
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,730
it's going to impact or incident I did I
does it responds and I'm gonna have a

298
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,890
whole bunch of new problems we're going
back to fight those problems has taken

299
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,130
some problems also one of the questions
are you still have our existing computer

300
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:26,030
systems are we going to do his responses
as well as in Detroit where I mean

301
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,990
reduction

302
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:33,450
you tell me right now you're gonna show
right away you start asking prices that

303
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,490
you understand something about how your
job is connected to the business you're

304
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,130
also just doing your job that's how
that's helped measures and think about

305
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:50,540
it hehe I don't necessarily but while
you're sharing your message so it's not

306
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,690
a bad idea just collect random facts
about what it is that you do I have a

307
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,250
friend that stuff doesn't do it just has
all but stopped and just keep that

308
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,530
you're coming to the meeting this can be
really really did you come into the

309
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:13,220
leading in somebody's think it'd be
great if we could add some basic

310
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,830
blocking walking filter rules in the f5
load balancers and one of the guys from

311
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,370
the networking Department says it's
going to slow things down too much and

312
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,389
you can go when I had my friend over
their runs all the website for Warner

313
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,240
Brothers tell me about the performance
as well

314
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,490
his eyes when he added filtering to it
and he doesn't really like it at all so

315
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,090
where do you come up with this idea
syndicates right it's the only thing I

316
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,120
like it because of the kind of knife
fight if you do go ahead to reading them

317
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,169
actually can reach you

318
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:54,990
Pocket PCs information really hard to
argue pieces information so just keep a

319
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,610
few events if you can

320
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,679
knowing everything that you can about
his new data points about what's going

321
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,020
on is your operations possible one thing
that spots and engineering this he

322
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:12,490
couldn't possibly why most 500,000
machines and then you can go we only

323
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,490
actually have four thousand sheen's

324
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,419
you know I'm the guy who runs this is do
we really want me she had one don't you

325
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:32,420
don't you know it's kind of interesting
question what is it and then eventually

326
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,090
you can work to the next question is why
is it that I do what I do think in terms

327
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:44,030
of your unit of measure the whole the
whole trip here is what is the unit of

328
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,220
measure for what it is did i do you
measure your head incident response and

329
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,420
you come up with your own unit of
measurement he still is you don't

330
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,530
respond salon is the number of incidents
that you can respond to fight I just

331
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,960
making it so you can rate your incident
response team two point three response

332
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,430
on sprout sounds incredibly focused
focused I don't recommend getting bogus

333
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,450
changes let your YouTube

334
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,919
but it's still coming back to this
critical incident response organization

335
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,480
he could be that the thing that is this
is from metering systems process is

336
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,779
doing more incidents he put me here he
used a national is doing more death of

337
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:34,429
their current we did he could be your
key is having less than an hour races

338
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:39,139
involved in your instant responses to
this entry completely different units

339
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:46,399
which one is your problem right now if
you're trying to establish a new bosses

340
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,320
incident management process would you do
all three and then figure out which ones

341
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,178
most interesting right measure all 31
she thought the trouble to measure all

342
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:02,990
three of them measure also bTW why
because you may find out over time to

343
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,809
levels correlate could be could be your
response rate correlates with your so

344
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:15,158
maybe even more people need fewer people
you need better trained that support we

345
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,409
get from the David story that you want
to tell people we need training we need

346
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,880
more automation I don't know what your
problem is that you're going to learn

347
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,149
that as you as you go through that
another way of doing that is to build a

348
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,250
list of what's inside you

349
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:39,960
process I can guarantee you I don't give
you my backyard she liked it a lot and I

350
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,010
guarantee you actually uses process
analysis about what it is that you get

351
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,470
it you will find places where you can do
you think so but more official

352
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:56,360
be different models you can you suggest
I do kinda like this phone show which is

353
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,360
essentially a sloppy blowjob this is a

354
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:07,640
do this and then between the two no no
it's things move around in this kind of

355
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,760
thing it's not really a flowchart
directed acyclic graph but moving from

356
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,120
the roots and branches between each
decision points what you want to do you

357
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,689
wanna know two things you might think of
more stuff but he thinks is good one is

358
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:35,740
the plot takes two different things and
you know you might you might learn some

359
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,120
interesting stuff

360
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,459
response process this is actually drawn
from a real experience I have it was

361
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:50,470
incredibly painful but so you know we
have a incident drops it and then we had

362
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:57,059
a WTF leader and WTF meeting is to
senior staff people for an hour and we

363
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:11,678
go right and then from that we're being
so I T five minutes and then we need

364
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,710
more information and then he asked I
didn't request use it WTF 20 meeting and

365
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:22,460
then we go further down back into our
triage so one of the things that I

366
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:30,400
realized my grandson this is why do we
have what we had ninety percent of the

367
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:37,799
time we have two WTF and he asked I T
the same questions we always ask you

368
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,490
what was what we see in this is Lourdes
NetFlow data during this time of this

369
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:48,910
article is it so we just go back to
mention this is almost didn't want to

370
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,480
come back and say

371
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,150
good right because basically what we
needed to do we need to get a program

372
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,080
for one day as this is administrated to
stick it on just stuff so that we had an

373
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,980
incident

374
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:08,090
10 questions that we always asks I T
collected and it was fired attached to

375
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,889
go slowly P

376
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,960
the incident response process so that we
didn't have to ask so it WTF meeting

377
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,199
we're already informed with all the
information that we needed some merged

378
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:32,230
with WTF WTF three hours waiting for ITT
the firewall more time so that's an

379
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:37,990
example of when you start building these
lower whatever his home remodeling it is

380
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:43,138
what it is that you do just basic
business process analysis chart

381
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:48,679
chance that you can be discovered which
he saw you need to fix it you you might

382
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,510
just be fantastic which case you can say
that right now a little reports

383
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,030
cases we did process analysis and
workflow we've discovered that there's

384
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,030
no place we can optimize it further

385
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:07,940
that's right because when you see that
intellectuals taken it into smaller than

386
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,100
one of the things really city we're
gonna you're gonna push to open office

387
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:19,839
some place else you can say because
we've optimized process . we can't

388
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,990
really I can tell your future plans to
triple option

389
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:33,868
you know you're not saying no don't do
it you're just saying we done costs we

390
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:38,680
don't cost and now you can apply
multiplication technology and you can do

391
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:50,990
the cost benefit analysis for you just
hope is sometimes you are close to go

392
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,029
off of your child that's not a bad thing

393
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,910
closed off your charge when she put on
your chart at the point where the flow

394
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:04,819
presumes on your truck he never comes
back he can put a big green smiley face

395
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,410
because now it's all somebody else's
problem you want to make it someone

396
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,589
else's problem permanently you want but
what if it's not someone else's problem

397
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,740
permanently but if it comes to I T and
comes back right now it's you it's you

398
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:26,779
can stop you have another touchdown
clock time you know you don't know how

399
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,520
much time he said well let's just
imagine him this year ago the incidence

400
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,000
post office to get into she is not aware
that the part of our flows it forward it

401
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,890
to like it and she comes back on our
guests he comes back on our desks six

402
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:48,879
months later this week run this part of
the process for hours and then idk six

403
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:59,250
months to do this piece I think people
my tears and foreign around the web or

404
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:05,250
something because you shouldn't take
that analysis which she wanna walk again

405
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:11,440
and see me get some basic processes
health and this is what it looks like

406
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,780
usual we spent our time and we have this
great big long tentpole weirdos into

407
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,260
another organization we don't know
what's happened but we're beholding to

408
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,660
that particular tempo

409
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,690
she can illustrate this very well no not
really a statistic it's a result of a

410
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,720
process in order to view that processes
is warning that process and then we'll

411
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,450
both be some real statistics so one of
the things you can do to get a staff of

412
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,500
people get needs to get there and you
see today he will not have been that

413
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:48,410
we're going to be something a little bit
this is how I talked to my dad will be

414
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:57,440
helping to open markets and is here to
protect you support you make your job

415
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:05,960
realized I need to know where he stated
I really don't need to know what we're

416
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,630
building a process flow chart and that
he like you to help me fill this in with

417
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:17,250
accurate information so I would like to
know if you just keep notes about what

418
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,490
you spend your time doing and I'm not
talking like to associate project and we

419
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:29,330
want to associate with tax so if you if
you put on your time card that you spent

420
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,450
six hours

421
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,640
pestering folk society for firewall logs
to know that because that way I can go

422
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:42,890
to the carpet and trying to pull a six
hours down if that's what you need you I

423
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,330
will fight that particular issue unless
I have that information I cannot protect

424
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,380
you

425
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,070
job and had a problem is because the
people in the IDE Department 12 hour

426
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:00,740
Marcus's measures they're calling to see
us so we have to pull it on them first

427
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,709
where they're going to get that state
planted in energy that's right it's the

428
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,660
same thing just how do you want a nice
executive management of the things you

429
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,690
think about this quantities right things
go up and down we don't worry about

430
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:20,200
fancy and computer security things you
get better so pages 101 count rises or

431
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,129
whatever the number of pieces of code
you push me away

432
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:30,200
rises or falls is very simple so what
she's a good direction some basic

433
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,410
biology don't have a quick pit stop and
bad stuff on the scene trying to

434
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:40,839
conceive breaking out into future takes
you don't want to have a red line that

435
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,620
says you know as as it goes up it's dad
and you don't have your incident rate on

436
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,580
the scene

437
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:54,069
number of pieces of code you push to QA
must be correlated and then what

438
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:58,730
constitutes a significant move going
there that's my advice

439
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,630
calculating what is a significant
movement is really really difficult

440
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:11,690
actually you wanna show basic times over
right I don't know what happened in 1983

441
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,690
1993

442
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:21,220
anyway I don't know what happened with
something interesting right we don't

443
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,080
have to go any further I don't need
fancy I can just presenting this is

444
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,500
needed you guys are all executives are
you doing the thing happened that I

445
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,190
don't get it causes else is the thing

446
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,770
but I have to do anything fancy on my
truck to try to say this is a very

447
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,660
versus so don't worry about and that's
what you want to make things all over

448
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:57,299
his number one when somebody comes in
with you coming forward consider that

449
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,790
time as a sequence of pipettes
consisting a few slices

450
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,589
its infancy can supply trucks
consistently sizes so what's done is

451
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:11,640
done you your pie chart is the thrown
away all of the information except that

452
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:19,779
once you find an executive pick the ones
places that make something better or

453
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:25,710
worse than it actually is full Davis and
it turns out that you actually get

454
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:34,380
better or worse your meeting is over his
you told me a lot of people she

455
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:49,190
underhanded and try to expose you to
shoot people

456
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:58,220
executive a lot of things we do we
played lots of other devices which is

457
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:05,509
actually that's exactly how that sort of
thing plays itself out you won't be able

458
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:12,790
to look at your networking be able to
see one of the one of the coolest it's a

459
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,759
country song does securities for
Columbia

460
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,800
basis of what they do this a lot out of
me

461
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,640
your PC and they said this is the boat
this is the incident response rate among

462
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:40,910
genes and this is the incident response
rate machines but once we got there not

463
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:49,870
because she's so Devine things come in
and pull those metrics out of something

464
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:57,830
you need something to agents election
because it is the problem of course you

465
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,230
don't know how you're going to use
numbers you want to look for something

466
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,040
as complex as much as possible and you
guys are you guys are popular software

467
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:13,560
development here but you've got no law
counts hope you got your stuff like that

468
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:20,090
so so when things look at these have a
correlation between the complexity of

469
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:27,010
the code and thought you had a
correlation between Joe friend and Jane

470
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:38,940
yeah kinda sucks to be you know I got a
way of tracking code above she's a

471
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:46,180
frequency bones that I can actually come
in the metric that says this is coded

472
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:55,160
for 24 bucks here we had a lot of things
I kept track if we do that you go to the

473
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:03,200
negative but the way you can have your
tracking bugs on the basis the reason

474
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,609
because the people who write them less
Johnny Cade the fastest people who write

475
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:11,069
the word

476
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:20,040
get to heaven profile once they say it's
for your own benefit you get to do

477
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:28,109
anything to yourself as one word ok so
you don't change algorithm constant

478
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:35,920
constant and you can't get this place by
2011 only things to do that if you are

479
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,599
producing time during grass changing
your dataset keep the old one as low as

480
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,710
the new one right and after five years
as the old one of the new look more or

481
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:52,810
less the same question why bother
computing 21 and 22 yeah it's okay it's

482
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,279
okay to just sort of getting one of
these things is quite right but what

483
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,270
she's going to be trouble

484
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:10,119
computing we're talking very small
amount stated this big gifts are you ok

485
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:18,300
so you can go more data on top of other
back to you under my question to be

486
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,230
asked to do give you one of my favorite
ones I hate people on a conference call

487
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:30,119
about six months ago we were talking
about so they were having problems with

488
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:38,060
their IP department so we came up with
this tribute as he explains so they

489
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:45,359
every time that they told ITV at the end
of critical security fixes going into

490
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:54,770
the clock ticks is going if they had an
incident led to the recalls told ITN the

491
00:45:54,770 --> 00:46:00,589
previews to charge basically saying all
the problems that we had this is the

492
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:05,770
percentage defined he just texted him
stuff we told them to we wouldn't have

493
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:09,240
so we had to run the incident response

494
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:15,270
36 times in the last four months more
than he would have had to run them if I

495
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,900
T

496
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:22,570
fixing things cool thanks its example
constructing these important things now

497
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:28,380
somebody might complain about that and
see your job you're like a politician

498
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:35,920
going wild at these pictures are numbers
right so easy to get around that is a

499
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,220
very simple clothes your argument
exposure algorithm and then plug the

500
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:47,709
numbers is this is how you been waiting
so basically what I did when I so

501
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:55,350
exciting is like okay so what we do here
this is what we do here is whenever we

502
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:03,350
tell I T about 60 critical security fix
it means we monitor when he told us and

503
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:09,640
then anytime we are in the process if we
do the root cause analysis shows that

504
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:18,660
it's really 26 is recommended we charge
this fee will be charged to do that and

505
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:28,540
I see some honest it's an honest attempt
at showing something numbers and then I

506
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:33,210
pulled the numbers in recent polls
fallout from the result once you agree

507
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:38,280
on how we're doing reviews today when I
plug the numbers in its already two way

508
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:44,080
back to meeting conf room you see
somebody pulling that trigger you need

509
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,830
to get the quagmire over their
scientific method before the numbers in

510
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,480
the second week

511
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:58,390
know what's coming right so I can ask
him how did you do actually do you need

512
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:03,330
to you need to start maneuvering before
the numbers here because after the

513
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,730
numbers but the only thing you can do is
go oh that's right I shouldn't stop you

514
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,780
want to force like to go there but she
looks pretty weak but that's the only

515
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,280
avenue for less because the only thing
you do is called personalized need to

516
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,970
click at this number may you release
your contacts he did your politicians

517
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,910
because you probably all along I didn't
know our economy was $63 last you can

518
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:39,759
really so you don't have to say this is
gonna cost is just something that

519
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,960
executives and this is thinking about
which is now this is how the individual

520
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,920
it is it's possible but I think it's
okay to be manipulative you tell someone

521
00:48:49,920 --> 00:49:02,850
I would manipulated this talk is right
it's okay to be being see if you think

522
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:08,150
about this vehicle that Francona sex in
Franklin County so built for this blog

523
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:17,220
about in 1775 right and he had his body
he posted a blog wars this blog and find

524
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:22,850
a Franklin decide just what he did is he
showed up at the guys step he actually

525
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:28,220
wait until Tuesday when it was raining
so you should at least I still dripping

526
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,220
red and he said you know I know

527
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:43,460
I understand you have a copy of this
particular book wondering if even though

528
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:56,880
you decide if I could read that because
I yeah this is guy gets the guy with

529
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,600
headed your way this is being complete
just kicking away from his doorstep

530
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:14,259
loans backing dog right you can't do
that they invite the person just past

531
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,840
ten that is completely true the guy who
got this posting a blog fallacious I

532
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,890
don't want to you can do exactly this
kind of trick so so so how do I get

533
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,980
there when you if your time thanks to
financial model which is completely

534
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,090
computed everything else for people if
you need them enough information so they

535
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:38,530
can do their own extrapolation to their
own extrapolation have this refusals

536
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:45,370
pleasure because they got the fields and
now they own part of that process so you

537
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:52,819
comin at you say you know our response
process five full-time engineers who are

538
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,700
all see here you know they're all senior
employees would like to abuse like to

539
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,850
bring more people they had plan so we
can bring in less senior people you know

540
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:09,660
you can figure out the budget executives
couldn't figure out the budget in fact

541
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,240
that they figured out the budget by
Dustin just a little bit more into your

542
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,390
argument that is an issue that's evil is
how business is done I don't like to

543
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:26,020
play that way but if you do more power
to you I just thought that's one piece

544
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:38,120
of course is a metro fire fighting still
existing beauty bias is a big city exist

545
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:48,259
in fact you make things while so that's
where their brains and wires we have is

546
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:55,120
when somebody throws out of pieces
information and you recognize it is true

547
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:01,839
you buying just a little bit more
recognizes you see something that

548
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:08,120
triggers a match it gives you a little
shop raise the reason why is it works

549
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:17,830
now it doesn't like the fantastic
dropping some music and you get his

550
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:23,980
pleasure as you predicted to drop the
stuff is ok almost done

551
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:32,029
couple more points this is something we
don't do a very good job of Computing in

552
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,549
general

553
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:40,788
and I i wish we couldn't for some reason
I'm trying to get some people I know who

554
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:49,069
he's going to try to to try to do some
of these kinds of things we talked about

555
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:57,619
the other day who stopped and I was like
you know he do something like that

556
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:07,529
5000 and once we are on the way I T 1000
and when she live without entice buyers

557
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:16,439
when she found in the water and ad
blocker

558
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:23,130
people call me doing stuff with no
published accounts and then measure the

559
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,589
outcomes on this for five thousand
different communities as it kind of

560
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:35,069
Public Health Study this is how we do
things in medicine I we measure the

561
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:36,670
outcomes

562
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:41,939
isolated communities the people who
smoke cigarettes smoked cigarettes in

563
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:51,670
your guy who died of cancer 8.5 times
it's not very difficult to do that we

564
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:59,329
don't do this because computer people in
Detroit think in terms of consistent

565
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:05,799
consistent solutions tend to be
backwards so we have this whole time to

566
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:09,559
talk to talk to people may go you know
you should control your Runtime that

567
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,660
means doing something like you're
putting your system configuration

568
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:26,740
or something like that people need to be
isolated community to community doesn't

569
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:36,160
need to accept the outcome measures up
guarantee you a really great

570
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:46,359
organization cause analysis of security
incidents where people had people had a

571
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:54,180
local local administrator well she's
worried central configuration different

572
00:54:54,180 --> 00:55:01,810
outcomes I guess I predict that you'll
find that this is people have local

573
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,900
administrator

574
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:09,960
comes to the ones we did you ever see a
workout needed paper to write about it

575
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:25,080
but he's considered really difficult
things you can do to make you want to be

576
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,910
honest with yourself and say because in
some cases were actually selecting a

577
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:34,580
particular community that were gonna
measures now you've got sampling bars

578
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:44,630
can really generate you can regenerate
could actually get this organization it

579
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,560
turned out the consumer organizations
talking to you had literally thousands

580
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:56,080
of desktop machines open configuration
office so they hired all his office to

581
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,700
come in

582
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:07,169
do microsoft office he stopped whatever
whenever it was the office to print

583
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:14,350
stuff out of whatever you don't you
actually the office has actually had a

584
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:32,520
reputation that population doesn't have
that particular be changed for years

585
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:40,070
before getting the wrath of almost done
right

586
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:49,220
another example this is a question like
what is the risk is this is great it's

587
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:54,990
gonna be able to stop by kings of the
business actions how do you track your

588
00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:02,790
is defined risk you might be risky he
says it's time for some time back in

589
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:09,960
time to do this season and so we ran
across the organization and it turned

590
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,990
out that they have won this is here it
was something like seventy percent of

591
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:33,930
their security is what that one business
unit 70 percent of the car was gone well

592
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:41,190
I just as opposed to quickly everything
we could get lots of official right so

593
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:45,680
basically laid back and this is one of
those I should be fired kind of reports

594
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:51,359
so we went back to executive management
so we'd like for I had that can exist

595
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,140
outside

596
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,230
each other can read all the attachments

597
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:03,039
fire it's going to resist it's going to
reduce reduce our security incident rate

598
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,309
but probably about seventy percent
actually figured this years ago so I

599
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:18,490
won't be fixed so I metrics from almost
twins hypothesize something and then

600
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:23,308
make a small change the outcome measure
the outcome and make recommendations

601
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:28,119
about his marriage as you want to be the
person that knife fight and that means

602
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:35,450
bringing in some recommendations and
stuff you got a look at the stuff that

603
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:39,569
you've got good top-down and bottom-up
top-down is what we do

604
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:45,069
designed to collect about what it is
that we do and then bottom-up is known

605
00:58:45,069 --> 00:58:52,099
information already half way we can see
what it is we hope will start building a

606
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:56,660
framework that allows to figure out what
further information we need to collect

607
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:03,288
examine it figure out what you can
generate better start doing just one

608
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:07,160
moment you know what's the best when's
the best time to plant a mighty oak tree

609
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,288
fifty years ago

610
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:18,680
Wednesday 2nd best road trip tomorrow so
don't go overboard on the statistical

611
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,129
never did you think statistics
underneath this stuff and then always

612
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:28,210
always favored comparative metrics over
recent to do the reason I like to do you

613
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:35,170
compare it is over as soon as it becomes
becomes so right you're talking to

614
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,530
somebody in this room and I say I

615
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:49,630
told you nothing interesting so number
to Bank of America activities I told you

616
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:53,680
I make it 250 I told you well

617
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:02,899
security but you don't know what if I
come into my say why had an average of

618
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:10,300
Tuesday's student protests preview it
still doesn't necessarily but now that

619
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:19,340
question what's so that's what I had to
say you know if you're not really a

620
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:25,920
highly recommend grabbed him by the way
to go to porn metrics statistics it's

621
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:34,810
like Lebanon's PowerPoint very funny and
also the video you see a lot of work he

622
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:40,480
troll troll for correlations a drug
which is really cool and it turns out

623
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,540
that goes up more likely to leave
