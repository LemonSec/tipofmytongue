1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:26,119
lot of you know semantic by a lot of
different faces I'm gonna share one with

2
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,460
you that you might know a little bit
less over the course of the last couple

3
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,199
of years we've embedded security into
more than a billion different things

4
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:39,349
automotive systems industrial control
systems critical infrastructure medical

5
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,839
equipment all kinds of devices from 8
bit 8 megahertz 2k of Astrium you

6
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:50,910
nineteen eighties great chips all the
way up to 64 bit exciting kinds of

7
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,639
things across the full range of the
Internet of Things my personal

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,149
backgrounds I wanted to be interactive
I've spent 20 years building security

9
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,260
and all kinds of things

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,149
aviation aircraft spacecraft and ground
station cellular base stations all kinds

11
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:12,399
of fixed infrastructure mobile vehicles
etc so without having to go ahead and

12
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:20,979
dive right into it so why are we
investing so much energy in protecting

13
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,020
the internet if things were really
excited about how the technology can

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,210
change our lives whether it's you know
your car you can stream navigation data

15
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,079
to ease your commute home in Los Angeles
traffic tonight or my favorite medical

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,449
example is have a contact lens now they
can measure your blood glucose let you

17
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,689
know visually if if your numbers are off
its a prototype of course but in big

18
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:50,320
industries like aviation small change of
1% can produce billions of dollars of

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,960
savings it so that's driving a lot of
the hype of the trillion dollar economic

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,610
impact on all of the investment around
IOT examples like that a lot of people

21
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,570
don't believe the huge projections of
billions and billions of devices but the

22
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,298
reality is the semiconductor industry is
already producing tens of billions of

23
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,820
microcontrollers of smart chips for
smart products already the big

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,030
difference is we roll the clock forward
is that those things are becoming

25
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,100
connected either connected to the
Internet directly or indirectly through

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,760
home networks factory networks that are
then connected to the enterprise but

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,709
it's tens of billions of things that are
that are connected that conductivity

28
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,510
both has a chance to to improve our
lives dramatically but it also has the

29
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,799
check

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,770
chance to be an avenue for a very bad
people to do very bad things so this is

31
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,970
not a doom-and-gloom predictions like
these are things that have already

32
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,000
happened including a three kilotons
pipeline explosion that happened in a

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,410
fortunately uninhabited area

34
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,260
years ago we've all seen the videos of
cars have been driven off the road

35
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,060
hospitals three hospitals it was
disclosed in June or infected through

36
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,200
medical devices like MRI machines x-ray
machines and blood gas analyzers your

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,089
medical equipment that you don't expect
to have enough vulnerability to become a

38
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,580
liability to the rest of the network and
yet they do still no blast furnace that

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,580
was December of last year it got hacked
through a gateway designed to protect

40
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,540
the operational network from the IP
network in the attack went straight

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,070
through that gateway and damaged the
blast furnace of a steel mill hospitals

42
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,920
car stolen oh not only have cars been
acting driven off the road and proof of

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,660
concept but in couple of parts of the
world a lot of cars have been stolen in

44
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,060
large numbers because of mistakes made
in the keyless entry systems simple

45
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,120
authentication you know not not building
these security into these systems right

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,410
oh and the wearable that were also fond
of you choose your device you know

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,570
quantified self a fitness banned most of
them expose Bluetooth in ways that are

48
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,910
not privacy friendly in ways that allow
the users to be tracked including track

49
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,810
from halfway around the world

50
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,120
home automation equipment not only can
you search showdown right now and pull

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,820
up you know pictures and videos of baby
cameras watching baby sleep but you can

52
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,030
get into industrial control systems the
same way and their survey last year

53
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,668
home automation equipment they looked at
nine different of the leading products

54
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:24,919
out there nine of the nine had serious
vulnerabilities seven of the nine had

55
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,950
multiple serious vulnerabilities so
across the board one of the things we've

56
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,909
realized is people don't really
understand what it means to build

57
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,680
security into these systems that's one
of the reasons were out there and giving

58
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,930
talks on what does it really mean to
protect these systems to a lot of people

59
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,110
they think of security as you add a
feature to something like you know pick

60
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,300
a random piece of furniture like a chair
in a room and all really lock that down

61
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
and ignore the fact that there are all
kinds of other windows and doors into

62
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,340
the room everything else can get stolen
security needs to be comprehensive if

63
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,469
you really gonna protect the system
needs to be from the lowest layers of

64
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,250
the silicon to Loftus layers of the
cloud protecting every potential weakest

65
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,770
link in between because if you don't do
that

66
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,549
adversaries can exploit those weakest
links so what does that mean in Ohio to

67
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,870
context that's one of the things we
talked about today and also talking

68
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,260
about how to apply it critical verticals
like industrial controls automotive

69
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,140
medical and the like

70
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,570
so as we do that they're one of the big
differences that we have to realize

71
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,000
especially as a professional community
of of software engineers is that the way

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,010
security gets delivered into this world
is very different than it used to be

73
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,950
mean years ago if you're going to
deliver security you just write you know

74
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,180
cute little bit of software that can run
on a single operating system that ran on

75
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,450
more than 90% of the personal computers
out there indeed meant a lot of money if

76
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,780
you're making hardware you didn't worry
so much about security because you knew

77
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,320
that the enterprise was going to add
security software later or the consumer

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,349
would just let the disc of their
security software in and add the

79
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,880
security later you can't slipped disc
into a multi hundred thousand dollar

80
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,419
industrial robot you can't slip a disc
into a programmable logic controller to

81
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,000
add security later you can't sleep at
discount your were able to add security

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,669
and you can't modify your your favorite
you know home thermostat these things

83
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,729
either have to have security built in by
the manufacturer or they're not going to

84
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,110
get security they're both technical
countermeasures where the manufacturers

85
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,220
are trying to prevent against
modification for good reason you don't

86
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,770
want the aggressors modifying these
devices they don't always do it

87
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,289
perfectly but they also have legal
countermeasures warranty clauses support

88
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,010
clauses in the like for you know
discouraging people from modifying these

89
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,780
things and now it you know it might be
an option for a hobbyist may be modified

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,000
their home thermostat inviolate those
warranty clauses but for the industrial

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,300
internet of equipment cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars really not an

92
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
option to to invalidate that capitalized
equipment

93
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,900
so for those reasons security really has
to be built in either by the

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,690
manufacturer or by security
professionals working in collaboration

95
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,790
with the manufacture the big shift in
how security gets delivered into the

96
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,410
system as engineers there are a lot of
other differences not just this this big

97
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,560
shift between systems being open or
close to such modification but if you

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,420
look at the fragmentation I want to talk
about fragmentation really at three

99
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,120
levels at the silicon level at the
software layer in at the protocol layer

100
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,610
because in each of those in the silicon
layer used to be everything ran for an

101
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,320
x86 architecture well in the IOT you
have eight but a Dr 16 bit

102
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,300
microcontrollers 32 and 64 bit arm in
addition to x86 X 864 any have more than

103
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,130
a dozen vendors at the operating system
later just above the hardware leading a

104
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,380
lot of articles the leading vendor of
operating system or the leading

105
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,280
distribution has at most a six percent
market share if you want to support the

106
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,869
majority of the OP of the market you
have to build for ten different

107
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,580
operating systems

108
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,669
quite different than sort of the
monoclonal era that we had before this

109
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,790
if you move up to the protocols that
levels even more fragmented so you look

110
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,010
across a dozen verticals it was cheap
have again about a dozen or so leaders

111
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:25,610
who each have their own proprietary
protocols and actually have a dozen or

112
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,580
so variants of those proprietary
protocols and those proprietary

113
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,900
protocols are often ill documented
documentation not publicly available

114
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,020
you literally literally have dozens of
dozens of dozens of more than a thousand

115
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,500
variants of these protocols mostly
proprietary mostly all documented so if

116
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,960
you could add security into this world
it's sort of very very different than

117
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,550
the everything being tcp/ip on you know
one flavor of OS on an x86 architecture

118
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,380
so that means we have to work a lot more
collaborative we've had to work a lot

119
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,530
more collaboratively with the people
building systems on how you embed

120
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,100
security into these systems so to do
that it's helped a sort of frame things

121
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,710
in a common architecture and boil it
down into simple cornerstones your

122
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,590
ingredients

123
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,230
building security into things so when I
talk about a simple architecture nearly

124
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,910
all of these IOT systems have sort of a
bottom of foundational layer of devices

125
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,010
and sensors and actuators the like those
are often controlled by higher layer

126
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,470
that's either running in the cloud or a
datacenter but service of some type

127
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,370
they're really controlling these IOT
systems you might or might not have a

128
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,220
gateway between connecting them and
those are sort of the three layers of

129
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,320
abstraction and then as we talk about
the cornerstones of security for what it

130
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,900
really means to build security into
these systems we start with protecting

131
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,120
the communications between these devices
so that they know how to trust each

132
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,240
other we talked about we will talk about
protecting the devices individually we

133
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,490
will talk about managing the security in
these devices because security is never

134
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,300
done it if you're not nimble your
adversary is in last no matter how well

135
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,640
you do each of those first three
cornerstones they're gonna be

136
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,480
sophisticated adversaries out there who
are able to overcome those first three

137
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,170
cornerstones into combat those you need
a sophisticated analytics capability to

138
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,060
find the poop footprints in the sand of
the adversaries who aren't gonna tribute

139
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,540
reporters so those four cornerstones
protecting the communications protecting

140
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,339
the device managing the device over time
and then really understanding your

141
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,630
system to detect those really
sophisticated adversaries those are what

142
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,610
we consider sort of the four
cornerstones of going to a little bit of

143
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,870
detail on each so protecting the
communications is one of the areas that

144
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,220
has I think some of the most
misconceptions lot of people look at

145
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,750
these extremely constrained devices in
say that you can't do security in these

146
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,190
extremely constrained devices they don't
have the CPU power or they don't have

147
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,010
the battery power

148
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,390
well first let me define what I think it
means to build security into the

149
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,170
communications later for these devices
in on the next flight I'll show that you

150
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,900
can do this evenin surprisingly
constrained devices build seriously

151
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,410
strong security even into these nineteen
eighties grade 8 bit megahertz

152
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,820
chips so when we talk about the security
that needs to get built into these

153
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,920
things we find in many of these Internet
of Things systems authentication is the

154
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,969
fundamental requirement there are a lot
of cases that believe it or not

155
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,020
encryption

156
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,060
you know content secrecy is not actually
a requirement when you're driving your

157
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,189
car you really don't care if anybody
knows what the engine temperature is but

158
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,460
you do care that that engine temperature
isn't spoofed because of the engine

159
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,510
temperature is moved against in your car
into shutdown mode that you probably

160
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,050
don't want to be doing on the freeway at
seven year eighty ninety miles an hour

161
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,439
or whatever speaker driving so
authentication is always a requirement

162
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,060
encryption might or might not be a
requirement for privacy reasons but one

163
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,750
of the common patterns that we see
because a lot of the data in the

164
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,620
Internet of Things is often passed
around from collection sensor handed off

165
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,860
maybe through a mesh network of a couple
of hops maybe through gateway sent up to

166
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,820
a cloud service in the Navy shared
across a couple of cloud services and

167
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,430
increasingly common pattern that we're
seeing is signing the data object on

168
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,760
capture so that wherever that data goes
it can be authenticated that both has

169
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,960
been able security properties of being
able to authenticate that data wherever

170
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,270
goes know the pedigree of the
information as well as the integrity of

171
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,750
the information but it also can be a lot
more battery friendly then decrypting

172
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:39,710
Andrea encrypting this data at every hop
across that complex system so far for

173
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,490
this audience you're you're familiar
that you click libraries are required a

174
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,840
touch on them a little bit on the next
slide because that's where a lot of

175
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,770
Engineers go wrong

176
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,860
not knowing about some of the libraries
that can work in these extremely

177
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,800
constrained devices beyond the libraries
you obviously need he's credentials

178
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,290
things like certificates in we're
encouraging people to build roots of

179
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,439
trust into these IOT devices one of the
things that we see right now is that a

180
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,800
lot of these devices are currently
communicating mostly in sort of islands

181
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,359
of ecosystems in their own little
universe but as they increasingly talk

182
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,520
to each other

183
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,680
being able to at least authenticate
another device that comes from another

184
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,130
ecosystem

185
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,580
requires having a common root of trust
you can least evaluate the certificate

186
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,420
it's still a policy-based decision on
whether or not you trust that remote

187
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,770
device but unless it unless you have a
mutual trust

188
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,910
evaluate each other's certificates it's
a it's tough it gets into sort of an

189
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,000
inspired mess of cross signing in just a
place that we don't want to be at scale

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,650
I'm gonna skip the the advertisement for
certificate authorities get right into a

191
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,040
bustling the method is extremely limited
devices kid you meaningful security

192
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,349
because they can the example that I like
to give you heard me mention it a couple

193
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:08,740
times 888 megahertz 2k of static RAM the
crypto that I like to mention is

194
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,760
elliptic curve with a 256 bit killing I
go there because that's effectively a

195
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,960
stronger actually stronger by the script
analysis estimates stronger than ours a

196
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:29,200
2048 which is best practice financial
services military grade crypto so what a

197
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,940
lot of people don't realize is that
elliptic curve runs ten times more

198
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:39,650
efficient than RSA 10 times easier on
the battery the Norris a ten times

199
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,449
faster and compute that RSA it's
incredibly valuable in these extremely

200
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:50,510
limited devices so for instance even in
88 megahertz chip can do this in about

201
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:56,840
20 25 seconds now you have to use the
Nano implementation of elliptic curve to

202
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,380
do that you can't use OpenSSL is just
not going to run into case that a crime

203
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,060
for instance to have to know the right
library to use but they're good

204
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,949
libraries out there and of course you're
twenty seconds 25 seconds is is not very

205
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,790
fast it's often not fast enough for the
engineering requirements but the reality

206
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,790
is I mean this is an early nineteen
eighties great chip

207
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:27,030
sixteen-bit chips that are out there
right now you know costs $0.25 and it's

208
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,780
a bit about a decade since the
sixteen-bit ships equipped eclipse to

209
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,480
the eight bit ships in popularity in
terms of what shipping by by volume so

210
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,310
if you need a chip if you need to do and
faster than 20 or 25 seconds which most

211
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,069
of us do you know I invite those
engineers to step out of the eighties

212
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,580
and early step into the nineties with
the 16 bit or 32 that chip that might

213
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:49,850
only

214
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,310
costs $0.50 I love a lot of the ARM
chips they're armed ships out there

215
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,219
right now the physical width of a human
here they can do crypto it at speeds in

216
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,649
a pretty close to this hundred
milliseconds what you're seeing in the

217
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,899
80 megahertz case but physical width of
a human hair run on the energy powering

218
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,160
of bridge vibration salted into concrete
using just a little mins accelerometer

219
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,089
to capture the bridge vibration convert
that into it electrons you know with

220
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,089
with chips like that costing $0.50 each

221
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:26,300
I don't see how physical size cost
compute power battery usage battery

222
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,120
numbers here but I don't see how those
are viable excuse anymore for not

223
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,920
building security into these systems
that are so cannibalize in some cases

224
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,399
with vehicles and aircraft industrial
control systems were literally begging

225
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,949
lives on the system's so it cannot build
security into them in many ways in my

226
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:48,709
mind is is is reprehensible to the
military's over here because I suspect

227
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:53,729
most of us are software engineers not
hardware engineers in the room the 14

228
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,920
and 16 Milla jewels that is such small
battery drain you could sign an object

229
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,240
every hour for decades and only use a
slice of a double a battery is quite a

230
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,909
double a battery well it turns out in
the industrial internet yet these things

231
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:14,789
like pipelines that ship oil and gas you
know up and down them but don't have a

232
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,140
lot of electrical distribution along
them and you literally want these

233
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,909
unattended sensors the last decades out
there in the cold just simply changing

234
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:27,260
the battery you gotta roll a-trak
hundreds of miles and so to be able to

235
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,210
last decades even in these older chips
is a is is very very valuable in some

236
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,740
cases I i like it really tap tip my hat
is well to Kim McKay for doing the micro

237
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,630
implementation of elliptic curve the
micro implementation runs alot faster

238
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:47,200
that's about a hundred milliseconds but
it also has a relatively small memory

239
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,100
layout you can run it in you know less
than three calves static RAM and it runs

240
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,020
fast in less than

241
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,440
seventy of static RAM so I really like
to tip my hat to him

242
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,860
these are his numbers so I just closed
copyright there in 414 McKay's layout

243
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,070
and chips like that

244
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,879
under 23 millage also almost as battery
efficient as as is running at eight but

245
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,570
it never hurts but you're running you
know in in just a few seconds so I i

246
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,820
think thats quite valuable so you gonna
want crypto like that for authentication

247
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,260
to authenticate communications but
you're also going to want crypto like

248
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,180
that so that as the device boots you
know that your booting the country you

249
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,580
want the device to run and not somebody
else's code that's one of the things we

250
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,250
sort of consider fundamental in
protecting the device is that you build

251
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,260
security from the ground up and so when
I say from the ground up I'll talk two

252
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,740
examples both with operating systems and
without operating systems but you want

253
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,270
to make sure that the device drivers the
network stack and the operating system

254
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:58,290
or all properly signed you want to make
sure that any application code running

255
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,790
at the next layer is properly signed any
cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL

256
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,750
or anything else we see that they're
properly signed we also encourage

257
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,810
companies to really protect the device
against runtime attacks and we'll get

258
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,000
into this later but you want to have
some sort of the network monitor

259
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,340
watching the data coming into the device
to make sure that you're not seeing

260
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,610
malicious data come in there are at
least two anomaly detection to notice

261
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,500
when things are looking suspicious in
your gonna have some settings on that

262
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,350
device is perfectly valid from a
security perspective to sign all of that

263
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,850
is a monolithic image that's incredibly
common in the embedded world of IOT but

264
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,919
it's equally valid from a security
perspective to sign it in a more

265
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,750
granular fashion design just like we do
in mobile for instance may be an

266
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,860
operating system image that includes the
board support layers inside each of the

267
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,520
applications individually and sign
settings atomically now that starts to

268
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,300
take us down an interesting path that we
were when we get to managing the device

269
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,639
over time if you need to update any one
of these day can be updated in a very

270
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,360
granular level you don't need to update
the whole image you just update that

271
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,110
slice

272
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,600
in fact if you take signing to the next
level where the applications the

273
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,240
operating system image or actually
signed and small pages are blocks of

274
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,420
maybe forty Kbytes each you can update
individual blocks surgically rather than

275
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:27,290
having to update the whole the whole OS
now if you're you know trying to update

276
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:33,700
on multi gigabyte image it's obviously a
lot better to update just a few K so I

277
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,549
mention this works with or without an
operating system this this layout you

278
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:42,429
know has the device drivers the network
stack the crypto library is the network

279
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:47,429
monitor in the primary code for the
device all compiled together into one

280
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:53,890
monolithic blob even then signing can be
too much more granular level if you have

281
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,120
a good previewed environment that can
handle that but that just ensures the

282
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,209
device into a relatively safe to say
never unsigned code never run unsigned

283
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,250
configuration data never trust unsigned
data but in addition to that we need to

284
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,110
protect against runtime attacks against
malicious data that might be coming to

285
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,959
the device this runtime it needs to be
different than a lot of you know the the

286
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
techniques that we've seen in the
personal computer era it needs to be

287
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,189
effective even when it's disconnected
that means it needs to be white list

288
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,450
based not based on blacklists needs to
be effective even if it never gets

289
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,960
updated needs to be based around
policies he needs to protect the system

290
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,270
itself both internally as well as any
network interfaces coming into the

291
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,570
system it to you that it really needs to
fit the targeted system so if you're

292
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:50,100
running a 100 s a new operating system
type chip that means you're probably

293
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,260
gonna need to try to accomplish a lot of
that by compiling it into the code of

294
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,620
the application itself and using some
compiler based strategies as well but if

295
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,799
you're running an operating system
they're good third party solutions out

296
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,970
there that do that to do all of this in
the last thing they will mention here is

297
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:15,059
the host a security should feed a bigger
analytics solution because you're going

298
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,000
to see anomalies down there that are
going to be suspicious and if that

299
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
device starts misbehaving

300
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,250
you want to know what those anomalies
looked like so that you can go look for

301
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,410
them elsewhere that goes back to the
footprints in the sand because a lot of

302
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:33,750
sophisticated adversaries don't trip na
trip wires so just double-click real

303
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,060
quick on a lot of the differences
between traditional malware blocking in

304
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,080
the sort of the

305
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:47,120
whitelisting behavioral approach so one
of the things that we've done in I will

306
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,830
try to make this be the only slight
differentiating our solution versus

307
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,389
anyone else's but one of the things that
we've done is we're not just

308
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,090
whitelisting code but we're whitelisting
the behaviors associated with that code

309
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,919
so somebody hacks that code with a
runtime attack attack or anything else

310
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,700
in then it starts to misbehave do
something different than it's done

311
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,300
before we can block that we can do that
an extremely constrained devices that's

312
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:17,399
very important for protecting against
zero-day attacks in embedded systems so

313
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,310
having talked about protecting the
communications in protecting the device

314
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:29,050
wanna talk briefly about what it means
to manage security in these devices so I

315
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,730
mean too many of us it's obvious the
need to manage security needs devices

316
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,100
but the reality is a lot of these
industrial systems are out there for

317
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,550
nineteen years on average so when we're
going into industrial settings

318
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,389
the people that we're dealing with her
dealing with systems that were built

319
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,390
nineteen years ago

320
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,670
encouraging them to build an update
mechanism it it can be a learning curve

321
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,040
but the thing that we try to encourage
them is to realize that vulnerabilities

322
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,280
are coming out on a on a daily basis you
might not be able to patch systems on a

323
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,260
daily basis but leaving thousands of
vulnerabilities unpatched for a decade

324
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,360
or two is is just unwise and even if you
only get a maintenance window once a

325
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,399
year in most organizations get me into
Windows more often than not when it's

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,520
tough to take a whole manufacturing
floor offline to hear you're not going

327
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,440
to do that just to do a software update
but you often have to take the

328
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,820
manufacturing plant offline to other
overhauls of hardware throughout the

329
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,070
actually get those maintenance windows
usually it's more often than once a year

330
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,070
but even just once a year over the
course of a lifetime of hard words can

331
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:45,220
be in the field for nineteen years once
a year is nineteen times better than

332
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,620
ever to do those updates did you them
safely and securely you need that update

333
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,090
mechanism built in from the beginning so
we're working with device makers and

334
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,178
we're working with people who own and
operate large infrastructures for

335
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:02,720
industrial control systems industrial
Internet in general that's why we're

336
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,100
really encouraging them to build in
these update mechanisms from the

337
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,740
beginning I mentioned before that doing
that in a way that doesn't kill battery

338
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,070
that doesn't kill bandwidth it's really
essential to do that in a very granular

339
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,340
fashion that you build in the code
signing and the update mechanisms in the

340
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,610
software inventory management
capabilities that you're able to do

341
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,570
updates in a very surgical fashion
updating block sizes like you're 40

342
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,850
Kbytes as opposed to trying to update an
entire monolithic image just updating a

343
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:41,459
single monolithic image going back to
the double a battery example often would

344
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,580
kill half of a battery would kill in
their mind

345
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,678
ten years worth of battery just a single
monolithic update but at the same time

346
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,269
doing updates in the granular fashion
building that capability in you can do

347
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:58,360
hundreds of thousands of updates for
less battery in for less bandwidth than

348
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,408
monolithic up days the bandwidth is
really important in settings like

349
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:05,389
automotive where a lot of these updates
they're trying to push over cellular

350
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:09,789
modems where somebody's paying for that
for that bandwidth to others battery or

351
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:13,000
bandwidth you're trying to protect
granularity is your key to being able to

352
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,919
update frequently very very low impact
your system and of course if you build a

353
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,039
good over the air update system once
whether you're building it for security

354
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,340
or building it for general management of
your systems you can reuse that same

355
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,439
over the air management infrastructure
for the same purpose built it right once

356
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,820
used it twice if you've built something
that can do 230 good management good

357
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,960
normal control of the system used at the
pool that your security telemetry if you

358
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,179
have a good infrastructure for pushing
out security patches use that too

359
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:50,049
push out your functionality updates to
build a really good infrastructure once

360
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:54,039
billed it safe and secure annual enable
yourself in lots of different dimensions

361
00:26:54,039 --> 00:27:02,850
so having talked about the the first
three cornerstones of protecting

362
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,059
communications protecting the devices
and managing the device I want to talk

363
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,178
about the fourth quarter stone is no
matter how well you do those first three

364
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,940
cornerstones some threats are gonna get
past those defenses it doesn't matter

365
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,110
whether you managing manufacturing plant
protected can buy for power generation

366
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:23,649
detecting those crepes threats requires
you to have a strong understanding of

367
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:27,969
what your system should be doing and
what it's normally doing so that when it

368
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,480
starts doing anything else you can
highlight those differences those

369
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,499
anomalies in use those as sort of
triggers for investigation to see if

370
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:39,499
somebody is beginning to operate in your
network

371
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,899
the good news is a lot of machine
learning techniques have been around for

372
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:46,908
a long time in their ways to boil them
down so that they can even run on a

373
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:51,119
single board computer such as running in
a single board computer you know a

374
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,908
little of the Indian Entertainment
System your car has a lil single board

375
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,529
computer behind it not that different
than say a Raspberry Pi reviewable black

376
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:03,330
you can run lotteries machine learning
techniques on single board computers

377
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,178
like that

378
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:08,279
embedded in automotive systems in other
vehicles and industrial control networks

379
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:13,850
watching the bus watching the network
looking for anomalies there that's

380
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,590
really important for a couple of reasons
some of them including a lot of this

381
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,269
infrastructure that's been around for
nineteen years

382
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,690
you even if it has the compute power to
do the crypto that we're talking about

383
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,580
even has the compute power that security
could have been built into that system

384
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,070
to legacy system it might not get
updated for a long time the manufacturer

385
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,999
might not build security into it for a
long time so you want to have a way of

386
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:41,210
watching the system as a whole in
mitigating those risks as best you can

387
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,059
when security can properly be built into
all of these inputs

388
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,210
in analytics like this you we and others
like us have used these analytic

389
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:57,700
capabilities to process in some cases
trillions of security events per year to

390
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,980
detect some of the most sophisticated
threats going against a lot of different

391
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,790
verticals including I O two systems of
sale systems automatic teller machines

392
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:13,960
as well as industrial control systems so
that the last little speak to in terms

393
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,220
of understanding your system is really
around realizing a lot of cases that

394
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,990
your system is beginning to talk to
other systems and as you do that you

395
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,060
want to have insight into which of those
other systems can you trust it helps to

396
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,929
know the safety and risk and connecting
to those other devices before it before

397
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,930
you set this connections and that's
where security service providers that

398
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,200
have cloud-based infrastructure so that
you can check the reputations of systems

399
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,040
India can can be helpful both reputation
services and also security status

400
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,870
particles where you can find out from
the other devices for the attestation

401
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,729
about what kind of hardware-based rid of
trustees have what kind of hygiene is it

402
00:29:52,730 --> 00:30:00,100
had so with with with those with those
cornerstones covered protecting the

403
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,520
communications protecting the devices
managing the devices overtime and

404
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:11,910
analytics capability to detect the
really sophisticated threats I'm going

405
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,260
to bore you with the automotive stuff
how many of you saw I'm sure its most of

406
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:25,770
you but how many of you saw Miller and
LASIK attacked the summer so there were

407
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,400
there were actually about six different
talks on hacking vehicles so one of the

408
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,200
things that was lost over is a lot of
these vehicles data telecommunications

409
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,520
unit that's not just a GSM modem but
that telecommunications unit has its own

410
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,040
real-time operating system in their
vulnerabilities both in those real-time

411
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,040
operating systems they're also
vulnerabilities not only in terms of can

412
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,740
come over at the Internet Protocol air
but those modems themselves in the GSM

413
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,820
protocols have vulnerabilities you can
actually hack modem just through the GSM

414
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,490
protocols

415
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,290
effectively have control of the single
board computer which in this case

416
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:06,110
basically put you directly on the CAN
bus and so Lundy's vehicles have

417
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,590
multiple modems in them they might have
a modem also plugged into the on-board

418
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,379
diagnostics port here there's others
were camping in mischief can get done

419
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,800
via the on-board diagnostics port their
other wireless interfaces supply chain

420
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,010
risks and the like button in the core
security mistakes that were exploited

421
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,060
this summer

422
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,679
executing unauthenticated commands
imagine your vehicle it a lot of most of

423
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,850
the vehicle state executes
unauthenticated commands accepting

424
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,790
unauthenticated connections especially
without any port of protocol

425
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,389
restrictions in those port and protocol
restrictions should be built into the

426
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,540
the front end of the vehicle anywhere
you have a modem you should be locking

427
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,830
down ports protocols doing that
indication right there

428
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,720
strong control over who can connect to
the vehicle you're not trusting that the

429
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,230
network providers he's vehicles Rome
other fundamental security mistakes made

430
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:03,510
the summer inadequate code signing so
you're one of the automaker's you know

431
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,960
was sort of aware that it might be
possible to make the blinkers go and

432
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,590
turn up the stereo in the air
conditioning but they thought they were

433
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:17,439
protecting things like vehicle speed
direction breaks acceleration protecting

434
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,950
that the high criticality CAN bus route
Locatelli CAN bus with Gateway modular

435
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,370
gateway chip which they often call a
security module if you're gonna have

436
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,530
something called a security module I
highly recommend you at least build code

437
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,960
signing into that because if you don't
build code signing into that you get

438
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,450
what we saw the summer which is where
you know a couple of bright folks like

439
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,370
Miller and LASIK relies not only can
they change the volume but they just

440
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,030
reflash that when will ship they're all
of a sudden they can literally turned

441
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,780
cars off the road and one of things I
hadn't realized before the summer is a

442
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,899
lot of the cars out there right now
they're staring isn't rack and pinion

443
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,070
hydraulic steering its electrical power
assist so once you have the

444
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,639
microcontrollers in the vehicle you've
literally got control over whether the

445
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,980
vehicle goes left or right and even if
they had done code signing this was a

446
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,230
quick aside in a couple of the talks
were memory corruption vulnerability

447
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,650
that could be exploited to even if
they've gotten the code signing right

448
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,570
the code quality was poor enough and
there was no independent third-party

449
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,950
security from security professionals
protecting that device so I mean they

450
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,490
basically made three levels of mistakes
on that one thing that they call a

451
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:31,610
security model and that's in addition to
a lot of these cars and their in-vehicle

452
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,770
infotainment systems they're running
browsers in apps that have exploitable

453
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,350
vulnerabilities in addition the
vulnerable little earlier so one of the

454
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,800
things that I I like to get into though
is what the automotive industry is is

455
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,510
doing so I mentioned in over the air
management the Open Mobile Alliance

456
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,140
device management standards the
embodiments como standards we see those

457
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,070
most of the earth peace for over the air
management of a vehicle software for

458
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,919
authentication the standards of come a
long way not just the camp stuff the

459
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,940
collision avoidance metrics program for
the vehicle to vehicle and vehicle

460
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:12,040
infrastructure which gets a lot of press
get your question a minute but but

461
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,500
putting a cryptographic bus into the
vehicle

462
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,600
leveraging some of the new standards
from the Hersteller initiative the

463
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,889
history standards and the standards for
putting crypto onto the CANbus I think

464
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,908
are are really exciting they still have
a lot of key management questions around

465
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,500
that the reality is those standards are
a couple years old now but with multi

466
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,340
tier supply chains it takes years before
you actually get hardware into into

467
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,919
vehicles so i'm i'm glad to see the
continued progress there and that's on

468
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,918
top of the analytics stuff in the
runtime protection secure boot

469
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,750
everything else ok you been I've got 10
you been a great audience thank you so

470
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,980
much happy to take questions

471
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,120
11 later thank you again
