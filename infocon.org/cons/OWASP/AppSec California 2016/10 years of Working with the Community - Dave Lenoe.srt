1
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,670
my name is Devon I work for Adobe I'm
here to talk about working with the

2
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,020
security community and before I start my
talk I should also mention that Adobe

3
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,170
recently acquired a stock photo company
so I was able to get access to like tens

4
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,680
of millions of photos and if you're in
chris hangs talked earlier he had an

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,460
intermission where he showed some cap
pictures feel like you stole my thunder

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,210
I kinda supersize that I just have
nothing but exclusively cat related

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:59,320
stock photos in my presentations it may
get a little old frankly so hold your

8
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:07,680
applause I'm not using pie charts at
least so I got that in my favor so the

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,630
reason i'm talking about 10 years with
the Derby security he had occurred to me

10
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,380
recently that it has been ten years
since acquired Macromedia at the time I

11
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,020
worked for the Macromedia product
security team and we took over as the

12
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:31,449
central Adobe security team so at that
time we decided we need to rebrand we

13
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,649
talked a lot about a lot of different
names one I swear this actually happens

14
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,450
one of the names that we talked about
was a doobie secure software engineering

15
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:49,109
services somebody's like asss that's
what we do we assess people caught up in

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,609
this and somebody's like actually that
spells asses

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:01,520
not assess so we went with Adobe secure
software engineering team or acid which

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,509
is more politically astute maybe less
descriptive but with this ten-year

19
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,330
anniversary I thought it'd be
interesting to look back at what my life

20
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,400
looked like 10 years ago

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,110
working with the security community as
opposed to what it looks like now so

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,170
with that background

23
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,798
the first thing that I thought was I
can't just make this like a BuzzFeed

24
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:31,930
stylistically where I have like 10
things only an InfoSec Pro from 2006

25
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,090
would would understand and I was like
well let's let's not throw the baby out

26
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,819
with the bathwater what would that look
like so I decided to conduct go down

27
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,298
this path a little bit member when
vendors would threaten researchers of

28
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,900
legal action when people thought
vulnerability counts for an accurate

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,569
measure of security disclosure debates
remember when we used to do that was

30
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,108
crazy people didn't used to update their
software so you get the idea

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,149
like the more things change the more
they stay the same I think somebody

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,690
could actually do if it hasn't already
been done a pretty good food stylist

33
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,769
tackle on this topic but clearly not me

34
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,670
yeah so and it wouldn't take 15 minutes
ago through it either

35
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,410
like many things can you say like member
when exploit these people were like that

36
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,850
was cool back in the day so moving on so
security community this is overloaded

37
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,769
terminology by the way that's a cap all
high-fiving a dog Paul somebody was like

38
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,819
what the hell when I was going through
the slides like what the hell is that so

39
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,350
there's there's a cat there's a dog in
there too i think thats the only dog

40
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,660
appearance so what is the security
community this is a talk from my

41
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,049
perspective so I'm trying not to
generalize this is this is purely my

42
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,420
take on things so your mileage may vary
when I think of security

43
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,958
unity I'm enumerate some of the
categories so security researchers

44
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,370
independent security researchers that's
that's the first thing I think of

45
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,110
security researchers who work with
vendors who might work in academia with

46
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,099
the government

47
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,488
there's all kinds of different people
doing you know vulnerability reporting

48
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,630
or research around security I think this
comes from being invulnerability

49
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,770
response for a while that's the first
thing I think of when I think of

50
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,549
security community then security vendors
people trying to sell you like

51
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,770
traditional pen test services

52
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:42,060
you know two people two weeks old
routine then there's 20 vendors there is

53
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,020
other kind of security service vendors
partners so this is when I think about

54
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,479
partners it's often competition or
cooperatives in frenemies people who are

55
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,620
in the same same sort of business
selling software but it could overlap

56
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,750
obviously with security vendors certs is
another good category partners asserts

57
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,810
easy other national serves customers are
an important part of the security

58
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,880
community and this talk a little bit
more about customers and importance

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,840
customers fellow employees so I work in
a company which is not exclusively for

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,890
an organization which is not exclusively
security focused so it's important from

61
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,240
my perspective to consider fellow
employees who might not be part of the

62
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,030
security team we consider them part of
the security community try to bring them

63
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,479
into the fold razor security IQ and
we'll talk a little bit about how we

64
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,510
attempted to do that so that's what I
think of when I think of security

65
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,820
community you could throw in like the
press there certainly part of the

66
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:56,140
community and other other groups but for
the purposes of this talk I just took a

67
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,930
category category by category and talked
a little bit about each group and how I

68
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,490
related to the to the group's then and
now so

69
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,490
yea again this is this is from my own
personal experience but as far as

70
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,389
security researchers works in back in
2005 in 2006 I can remember a lot of

71
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:26,589
kind of heated conversations mainly over
e-mail with security researchers where

72
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:30,619
it seemed like a fair amount of context
setting was required and common ground

73
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:36,009
was hard to find so a researcher with
think you guys are taking this seriously

74
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,539
enough or you're not fixing it fast
enough we might think you don't

75
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:46,849
understand how this software works you
don't understand the context and things

76
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:56,319
could get a little a little heated at
times there's a very specific memory of

77
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,319
getting feedback annual review time in
the feedback was from somebody on a

78
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,729
product team who saw this is my boss
telling me

79
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,860
annual review things to work on he said
you say are too many times when you're

80
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,289
talking with security researchers so I
know the exact conversation I know I'm

81
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:23,029
pretty sure I know who told you told my
boss I think there's any way he

82
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,300
basically I had this conversation I know
the conversation it was with Fred rhinol

83
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,229
who since went on to form he's a great
guy I've had many subsequent

84
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:41,269
conversations with him and I think I've
said a lot less in those conversations

85
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:47,529
since then but in the sticks in my craw
I think number one because it ended up

86
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,679
in my annual review and I got like doing
for it and number two because I still

87
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:59,448
say a lot so I'm holding on to this the
sort all been yet but I think it's a

88
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,709
good representation of fact that I was
not used to talking to researchers and

89
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,339
two people in the community so the more
you do that you know the more you get

90
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,669
used to it and I think we've gotten to a
point where it's it's a lot easier to

91
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,919
exchange information and this kind of
divide

92
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:25,400
I picture back then at least in my mind
is certainly less and now so we have

93
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,190
multiple platforms that assist with an
enriched this vendor researcher

94
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,860
communication that is pretty amazing so
to give you some context here you can't

95
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,100
really see this but this was courtesy of
the Wayback Machine this was the

96
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:48,570
Macromedia vulnerability report form
circa December 2005 so this was state of

97
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,220
the frickin art like we were really
proud that we have this vulnerability

98
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,920
report form and apparently I guess we
still could be because a lot of people

99
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,939
don't have to report forms at least
according to access doc yesterday so

100
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,720
that's kind of shocking but now you know
fast-forward ten years

101
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:15,320
me in 2005 the idea of having to use
hacker one now so having a purpose-built

102
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,740
platform for receiving vulnerability
communications that was science fiction

103
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,220
ten years ago there is no way that could
ever come about and here we are

104
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:33,140
what a time to be alive we have
platforms that the do this and I i

105
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,420
really honestly mean this being globe
it's it's a huge development so for

106
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,400
researchers if if I can put myself into
their shoes

107
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,430
it gives them the ability to flex their
muscles earn money get credit and build

108
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,560
their reputation in for organizations
like ours I can say confidently that

109
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,920
it's it's really increase the
signal-to-noise ratio like we're getting

110
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,800
a lot better reports because people get
credit for filing good reports and they

111
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,609
get demerits for filing spurious reports
so so this is a big deal and it's

112
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,900
something that I I think should not be
taken lightly

113
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,940
so I think this is mainly just an excuse
to use this picture which i think is

114
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:31,490
pretty awesome but I think something
that I learned and had to learn and keep

115
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,190
in mind all the time no one in the
security community is his evil at least

116
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,260
the ones who actually communicate with
you so you know when I was talking about

117
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,960
the categories of people in the security
community you could make an argument

118
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,620
that attackers should be part of that
category I don't consider them part of

119
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,240
the country because they don't talk to
me so when it comes to people who

120
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,010
actually do talk to me and who do talk
to each other I think it's safe to say

121
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,930
everyone is in it for a good cause to to
make the world a better place sometimes

122
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,390
you have to remind yourself of that so I
guess to give you an example so this is

123
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:20,350
late 2000 Carson I round who probably
but his pronunciation his last name used

124
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:28,250
to work for a secure area since its
works now for a risk-based security to

125
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,730
send us a bunch of reports in his style
is very blunt and brusque so he was

126
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,050
unfiltered in his feedback to us and he
was pounding us sending us a lot of

127
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:45,800
stuff it wasn't until we talk to him in
person and he told us hey I give you

128
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,949
guys a lot of tough love the reason I do
it is because you guys are actually

129
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,380
working with me I have worked with have
sent reports other vendors and they they

130
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,080
don't they don't engage with me so
you're getting a lot of my attention but

131
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,540
it's because I wanna make your products
better so her eight you know a little

132
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,839
bit of a kumbaya moment but it it made
me realize you know everybody is is

133
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:17,180
trying to help out here and got me out
of a kind of a bunker mentality so I

134
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:23,810
think if you're the lesson here what I'm
trying to say sort of him fisted Lee the

135
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,768
lesson here is if you are getting
engaging in like a Twitter world blog or

136
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,769
whatever or an email war with somebody
and you both in the security community

137
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:39,519
get on the phone with them or talk to
them in person or stop by their house in

138
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,600
a rainstorm and ask to borrow books
whatever whatever that story was their

139
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,119
markets mentioned because we're all you
know we're all in this together we're

140
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:54,679
rowing in the same direction so security
vendors back then there's a lot of snake

141
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,488
oil and therefore we're now slightly
less snake oil and therefore we're

142
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:09,540
mostly kidding so that the difference i
think between 2005 2006 and now is

143
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,069
there's a lot more purpose bill tools
and applications are a lot of vendors

144
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:21,360
selling great products so I mention how
can one that's a very specific purpose

145
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,569
and very specific service which is made
things a lot better their other the

146
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,949
other great services out there just to
mention a few that we use social

147
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:37,719
sciences club passage evident that I owe
these are great tools that that have a

148
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,089
very specific purpose moreover since
2005 there's there's been a

149
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,279
proliferation of tools that have been
built and contributed to the community

150
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,749
obviously Oscar nos conference really
happy to be here this is my first time

151
00:13:54,749 --> 00:14:00,480
at Absa California it's a great
conference but obviously lots of tools

152
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,569
wonderful tools so help us from Adobe
you talked yesterday about security

153
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:12,139
automation tools there was one of the
last ones you mentioned but there are

154
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:17,629
companies that have contributed tools
out into the community as query

155
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:24,439
Netflix's contribute a bunch of stuff
too many examples to mention but this

156
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,149
has made the world a much better place
and not that that wasn't happening ten

157
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,339
years ago but I feel like it's it's
picked up a lot of steam in people look

158
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,129
to contribute things back to the
community

159
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,660
whatever we're building something we
think about

160
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,579
does this make sense to open source and
sometimes it's harder to do for you know

161
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,680
specific configuration reasons policy as
she was talking outside be from Twitter

162
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,489
and they've been having some trouble
figuring out how to get it out there in

163
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,080
such a way that would be usable for
other people so over a few words about

164
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,820
us versus traditional Penta so this is a
big difference from 10 years ago

165
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,520
actually from two years ago right i mean
this is another science fiction thing

166
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,750
when I first heard this ideas like I
don't know if this is really gonna take

167
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:23,580
and it's it's really taken so few things
to mention here which which I think

168
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,530
we've we've discovered over the over the
years so traditional pen test the amount

169
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,709
of effort that you put into preparing
for them will contribute to hell

170
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,260
effective there so you need to set up
the logistics you need to prepare the

171
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,280
product team that that makes a big
difference when it comes to crowdsource

172
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,540
penthouse thats exponentially the case
you need to really think through what

173
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:54,920
you're doing so I think I did a great
job of talking about to mount your not

174
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,040
to bounty you have to get to a point
where you're ready so in our case what

175
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,020
this means is we've reached the point of
diminishing returns with a particular

176
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,939
product or service when it comes to
traditional pen test so we're just not

177
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,500
getting my body vulnerabilities or you
know the reports are are lacking in

178
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,850
actionable things so that's when you
turn the switch on and try out for a

179
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:26,340
spin test or bug bounty but you don't do
this lightly you need to emotionally

180
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,370
prepare the team because this is not
something this is something that takes

181
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,470
some effort you need to be able to
respond quickly so that's something that

182
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,320
Alex mentioned as well

183
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,930
part of that is the expectation the
tester when they are reporting something

184
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,339
they're expecting it to be fixed quickly
part of that is craven self-interest

185
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,660
because we had cases where at about one
case where

186
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,850
somebody reported high severity issue we
fixed it we fixed it quickly cause high

187
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,079
severity but also because we wanted them
to retested and as it turned out they

188
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,389
found out the fix was insufficient we we
paid an extra two retested that's kind

189
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,970
of how it works but it was it was worth
the effort to get it fixed quickly it

190
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,089
was worth the effort to have the money
to pay to get it retested because the

191
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,260
fix is not sufficient so you need to
prepare the team to turn things around

192
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:26,400
quickly there's some other benefits and
things that you can prepare for when

193
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,179
you're doing a crowd-sourced pen tester
about bounding it's a good live-fire

194
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,260
exercise like sort of you can look at it
as kind of a blue team thing where

195
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,760
you're testing and monitoring and you're
logging just to see how things how

196
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,530
things look to operations teams and make
sure that they can detect things that

197
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:53,470
are happening from the from the testers
so all in all we've had good experiences

198
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,830
with both were doing more crowds are
spent test these days and it it's

199
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,490
yielded lots of very creative bugs as
outsourcing yesterday there there's

200
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,429
never been an unsuccessful one that
we've had we've we've gotten lots of

201
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:17,820
good issues out of it so with partners I
think to to generalize people didn't

202
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,320
talk to competitors if they did in my
experience you know we did it to you

203
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,840
play your cards close to the vest so as
of now I think for a variety of reasons

204
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,860
more realistic collaboration is
happening like real world problems are

205
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,209
being worked on

206
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,549
part of this is necessity so the world
has changed there are more attacks

207
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:49,590
there's more information flowing freely
part that is social media so ten years

208
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,620
ago

209
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,870
you know no twitter twitter move things
around very quickly we only had like

210
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,539
blogs to deal with backgrounder blogs to
use so now

211
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:09,269
to give you an example of collaboration
on a real-world problem so Flash Player

212
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:14,269
we have been working adobe has been
working with Microsoft and Google the

213
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:18,259
security teams at those companies on
different security related projects

214
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:24,479
along the way more recently we started
working together with Microsoft and

215
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:30,159
Google so literally all three teams are
in the same room together and that's

216
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:38,089
that's a big deal so few years ago the
idea of these we compete with both these

217
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:42,789
companies and as you probably are where
they compete very fiercely with each

218
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:48,259
other so the fact that we're all working
together shows the value that each of

219
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,769
these companies places in the
collaboration in the knowledge that you

220
00:19:52,769 --> 00:20:00,399
security teams have so this is a great
example I think it's a testament to keep

221
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,928
people are more willing to work with
each other than they were before this is

222
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:12,179
a rant about CBE counts and I'm gonna
skip it just so I'll spare you guys cuz

223
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:21,979
I don't get to rain so customers back in
the day so customers would not ask a lot

224
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:27,839
of security related questions it was a
very reactionary stance or reactive

225
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,958
stance something if something went wrong
they would get in touch with us so

226
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:36,109
something going wrong was a
vulnerability report being published so

227
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,859
I want to know is as real as a severe
and Expo in the wild obviously that's

228
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,968
something going wrong a patch which was
which broke something for them that's

229
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:50,320
when they would get in touch with us now
we're at the point where customers

230
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:58,579
regularly send us 500 + questions around
security so I almost hate to admit this

231
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:07,719
but this has taught me the value of
compliance and certifications so ten

232
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,429
years ago

233
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,749
compliance certifications that wouldn't
have really been on my radar much five

234
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:16,249
years ago I probably would have been
pretty dismissive of it as I can check

235
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,500
the box exercise

236
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,980
now I see there is value in being able
to turn something over to a customer and

237
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,920
say hey you know we got a third-party
validated that we have these controls in

238
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:33,670
place so something like ISO 27001 talk
to type 2 there is value there if you

239
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,930
see Jeremiah talk this morning he was
talking about PCI and how it's like

240
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:43,850
actively bad so I'm not I'm not going to
argue against that and I'm not going to

241
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,620
say that compliance is the end all be
all but it can be used for good purposes

242
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,209
it can be used to leverage yeah getting
things done with the product team and it

243
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:59,750
can also be used to present to customers
in and show that you know some effort is

244
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:06,750
being put into security so we try to
talk to as many customers as possible

245
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,170
the path of least resistance as a
central security team in in an

246
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,720
organization that's just not dedicated
to security is just to sit back and let

247
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,410
the bike from the house people who know
how to weigh the human and talk to other

248
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,020
people so people like sales support
account managers let them deal with

249
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,060
customers but we found a lot of value in
talking to customers from a security

250
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,740
perspective so you have to find the
right people to talk to you sometimes

251
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,240
it's just them yelling at you and that's
fine but other times you get substantive

252
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,850
you get substantive you back from them
so to give you a couple of examples of

253
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,240
server products ColdFusion 9 a.m. and we
have locked down guys for these products

254
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,760
overtime and talking to customers you
know we would tell them like hey you

255
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,450
know make sure to do lockdown guide and
there were a bunch of customers who

256
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:04,180
weren't doing it so I can't blame them
you can't count on customers to to make

257
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,200
changes to to be more secure so we've
tried to put more effort into making

258
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,520
those those products more secure by
default

259
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,710
other conversations that have led to two
good things in the late to thousands

260
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,200
javaScript is a big attack vector for
Acrobat and reader so we talked to

261
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,960
customers they were leading with us to
give them a way to turn on JavaScript so

262
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,300
again another vivid memory that I have
is getting a call from a big customer

263
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,040
who was very security-conscious and
seeing the number and there was like a

264
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,840
security issue happening at the time so
I can agree on my teeth and pick up the

265
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,949
phone and surprise surprise they were
saying hey this medication that you gave

266
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,160
us turning out JavaScript we were
redeployed it over a hundred thousand

267
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,860
jobs you know within a matter of minutes
it's working great I was like Oh my God

268
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,649
thank you cuz it's not very often that
you get praised as a security team

269
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,890
person from from customers so lots of
good things happen from customer

270
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,270
conversations so internal product teams
I know what this picture has to do with

271
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:19,320
internal product teams but it needed to
be part of the part of the deck so a lot

272
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,860
of context setting again this is kind of
a theme but a lot of context setting was

273
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,979
required

274
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,660
people would say but no one would ever
do that so to give you an example you

275
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:34,450
know we're trying to make the case like
buffer overflows are bad and I remember

276
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,440
this engineer was like you know whatever
your you guys are just trying to cause

277
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,790
trouble basically no really like you
somebody could control memory they could

278
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:55,080
execute code and shaking their head like
nobody could actually do that

279
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,850
theoretically yes so we don't have to
have those conversations anymore which

280
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,409
is which is good and there's no context
heading required we're getting

281
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:14,160
world-class response time so to talk
about response time so I think ten years

282
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,640
ago the world was a different place when
it came to response times in in the way

283
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,580
that people put out patches or you know
deployed fixes was very different than

284
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,879
how they need to do it now it won't
surprise you to hear that we've had to

285
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,220
deal with experts in the wild and the
teams that have learned to roll out

286
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,190
fixes like extremely quickly

287
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,950
for us one of the things that we decided
relatively early on is if we get an

288
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,070
expert in the wild

289
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:52,730
we're going to fix it immediately so
that makes sense right but there is a

290
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:01,470
there is a train of thought that if an
expert in the world is is reported and

291
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:07,269
it's a targeted attack it may be better
to wait until the next patch cycle

292
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:15,809
rather than wait it out and rely on
things that are outside of our control

293
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:21,240
like the fact that the attack is not
gonna blow up in volume or the fact that

294
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,419
it's gonna get circulated and downstream
of the next week it we just we just fix

295
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,570
the issue so the downside of that is we
do a more out of band releases in that

296
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:39,918
puts more stress on customers but we
feel like it's the right thing to do

297
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:49,309
because there are things outside of our
control that we can't account for in the

298
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:54,440
same way when it comes to reports from
security researchers if there is

299
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,019
something that's been reported that is
questionable in terms of the severity

300
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,019
most of time we're just gonna fix it

301
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:06,779
give credit to the researcher given a
CBE because it's not worth the time or

302
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:12,950
the capital basically to piss them off
and to go back and forth in and are you

303
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:20,639
about it so in terms of the expectations
expectations are higher so this goes

304
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:28,000
both ways people expect faster fixes
some of this has been forced by experts

305
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,840
in the world some of this has been
forced by researchers putting their

306
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,039
putting a alliance and saying I'm going
to disclose on this date in being more

307
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,908
firm about that so what this has meant
to us

308
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:47,409
2006 2005 we had irregular past cycles
we moved to quarterly updates more

309
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:51,970
recently with 542 monthly updates and a
downstream effect of that

310
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,830
is if you have a shitty update system
and you're putting out a bunch of

311
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:02,330
updates thats makes everything a lot
worse so you need to not only put out

312
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,030
updates quickly you need to have you
need to give customers the ability to

313
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,970
update themselves quickly in chrome gets
credit for doing background auto updates

314
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,340
which a lot of other companies including
us have since adopted so that's a way

315
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,720
for customers that the exception is
customers who manage their environments

316
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,000
and i've talked a lot of customers who
have just given up and said we were just

317
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,200
turning on auto updates and if things
break they break we'll deal with it

318
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,920
later that seems to be the same way to
approach it

319
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,800
expectations on the reporter side of the
researcher said have also increased so

320
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,500
ten years ago we would get like one line
bug reports that we had to Lake we had

321
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,570
too partisan and figure out on her own
now

322
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:54,000
well for bug reports are more the
expectation and actually submitting

323
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,700
fixes later open source projects that's
also something that researchers do so

324
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:08,250
the world has gotten has changed a lot
in in good ways to give you quick is

325
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,630
important in 2009 we have this wretched
x1 the wild one of her first high

326
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,650
profile experts in the wild

327
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:22,940
the first one since then so last year we
had hacking team the hacking team breach

328
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,370
there is your days in that some affected
us we were able to get batters out in

329
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:38,899
three days so it's not great experts in
the world but fixing investors is key so

330
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:45,140
when it comes to go still talking about
internal employees we've talked about

331
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,140
our training program the past and I
won't spend too much time on it here but

332
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:56,300
in short it's martial arts black belt
style system so that you have my belts

333
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,930
it's computer based training is like 15
to 30 minute modules on things like

334
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,580
cross-site scripting 101

335
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,720
and then there's green belt which is
like the next level so it's in some of

336
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,210
these trainings are available through
safe code we've pushed out

337
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,590
computer-based trainings through safe
good organization so you can check those

338
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:23,280
out there but this training program was
kind of a grassroots effort developers

339
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,060
really latched onto it and it brought up
the security IQ and again including more

340
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,000
people in the security community so
we're at the point now where we have a

341
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,080
central product security team but we
have people outside of this product

342
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,710
security team who are reporting
vulnerabilities to other vendors and

343
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,550
getting acknowledged as you know some of
the top reporters there so that's a

344
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,409
great place to be you know we'd like to
take some credit for that the reality is

345
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,620
these people are are great and they do
these things on their own but we've

346
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:01,149
gotten to a point where the current day
and age as security practitioners we

347
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,060
cannot we're not the only line of
defense and we can't be we can only

348
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,370
scale so far and automation can only
skills so far there's there's certainly

349
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,699
a human element to a lot of the work
that's that's a theme that I've heard in

350
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,910
a lot of the talks in the last couple of
days and I believe that to be true so if

351
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,160
you don't have a strong security culture
across your company it's going to be

352
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:32,430
really hard to make meaningful change so
I guess you know the aloof security girl

353
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,240
or guy you know cross their arms and
says you're doing it wrong like we can't

354
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:45,260
do that anymore so to bring us all
together to give you an example of I

355
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:51,040
think the security community pitching in
together we had a an interesting project

356
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,040
that we did so we needed a pen test for
an Adobe service in this is one of the

357
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,260
ones that we talked about which had more
mature security posture we wanted to

358
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:08,410
evaluate and test services this in this
case as by crowd and we thought this was

359
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,450
a good a good case study to do the same
and at the same time we're evaluating

360
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,519
single sciences so we said let's

361
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,799
let's bring us all together let's have
single sciences deployed with this

362
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:28,168
service we won't have them block
anything will have them in monitoring

363
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:34,269
mode see if they can flag stuff that's
being found by the by the researchers by

364
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:40,919
the pen testers so we did three birds
one stone we brought all this together

365
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,089
so this required the Adobe service the
product team that we're working with to

366
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:53,859
be willing to do this experiment to
evaluate these things this required the

367
00:32:53,859 --> 00:33:01,779
crowd folks to be willing to participate
in the experiment and last but not least

368
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:07,709
signal sciences required them to do a
bunch of work to help us evaluate how

369
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:12,450
things went and then they do do about
your work and a result the result of

370
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:20,309
this was we got a great contest we got
great data on how well the crowd spent

371
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:22,269
at work we've got great did on house

372
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:26,969
well signal sciences worked in this
environment and overall is it was a big

373
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:32,919
success for us I think the bottom line
there as I think we're all collaborating

374
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:38,469
more the reality is we need it's out of
necessity and we need to do it more so I

375
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:44,289
think one of the things that I learned
and was already knew about was brought

376
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:49,489
in to further focus on these last two
days is we're in a bit of a bubble here

377
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:56,329
so we're we're aware of security in the
state of security there are a bunch of

378
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:02,559
people outside of our community who are
are not aware they don't have any idea

379
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,829
how bad things are and if they do have
an idea of how bad their they don't have

380
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:13,339
any idea how to fix it so in addition to
being able to scale within our own

381
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:18,529
organizations we need to be able to
scale beyond just our own our own bubble

382
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:26,700
own community so this picture with three
birds on it so that's that's where I'm

383
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:32,658
gonna sum it up I think the world we've
we've made a lot of progress in the last

384
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:39,179
10 years we're gonna need to make a lot
more I think one thing that is good all

385
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:45,130
the lessons we've learned in the last 10
years some of the some of the industries

386
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:51,290
that are new to him first sack there
they can take advantage of all the

387
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,759
lessons we've learned so they know it
won't take you know cars the car

388
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,900
industry 10 years to get to the point
where it because we can help them along

389
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,360
the way and you can see that's already
happening jim joined her one I think

390
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,190
that's a great great step in the right
direction just in terms of getting them

391
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,440
selves into the security community fold
so that's all I've got if anybody has

392
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,300
questions

393
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,300
happy to take him

394
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:43,089
one over the last two days is how do we
know that what we're doing is actually

395
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,560
the right things how do we measure the
right things and how do we get away from

396
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,000
just got feeling all we just scanning is
good training is good we don't really

397
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,170
know what's your take how do you measure
how do you know you actually working

398
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,430
with the right tools for improving the
right things to to make a difference

399
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,180
environment so some of it that's a
really good question I don't have a

400
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,810
great answer to it I think metrics you
know metrics are good data is good but I

401
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:20,140
think what you need to do is spend so
you can do a risk rating you can decide

402
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,799
where the most risk is in your
organization and spend the most time

403
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,330
they're so rather than trying to gather
data from all over the place

404
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:36,490
figure out where your most concerned
gather as much data as you can

405
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:43,040
there and concentrate your efforts and
and measurement in in the areas that

406
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,270
matter the most

407
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,259
so I think that's where you start and
then you scale out from there and

408
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,390
leverage that work that you've done on
the most important parts so that I mean

409
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,190
like network segmentation things like
that where you're you're you're putting

410
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:02,800
your most valuable data in the most
secure place and then moving on from

411
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,800
there

412
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:26,810
reports to you would you like the number
to be higher or lower

413
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,670
that's a great question so in are you
talking about you're talking about our

414
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:44,270
products you talking about web services
so I think we so as a high profile

415
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:51,480
companies we get a lot of attention so I
don't think we're we're at we're at a

416
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,580
point where we need more more attention
where we need more researchers looking

417
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:06,600
at us but I think I think that there
there are certainly a lot of

418
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:13,220
organizations that they could use more
help there so I think just having a

419
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,720
worldwide community that's accessible
through some of these crowdsourcing

420
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:27,459
platforms is is a huge benefit you
probably have more data about this and I

421
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:36,950
think I think we have hundreds and it it
we can scale up to thousands if we feel

422
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,950
the need

423
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:56,320
ok just a question I have a similar to
yours in another vendor and was

424
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,640
wondering about sharing your internal
findings we talked a lot about the

425
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,940
researchers in communities and partners
but we we discovered of internally we

426
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,240
were always bustling with the question
of do we inform the community at large

427
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,339
that we've done stuff internally or do
we just addressed the ones that are sort

428
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,350
of an influx from the outside

429
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,980
have you been dealing with Syria talking
about issues that apply internally but

430
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,470
also apply externally or I think in in
general any any finding any

431
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,779
vulnerability that I would discover and
my own internal pen testing or

432
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:37,660
developers discover we don't typically
go and you know what signs V's to those

433
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,069
in public though to the world we just
the other than we fix them we're all

434
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,190
those out but we're not sharing that
knowledge then with the rest of the

435
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,130
community of that sort of common
practice or were you sharing more than

436
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:49,800
that are you

437
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,420
involving others in your own findings
yeah so I think when it comes to things

438
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,020
that issues that have general
applicability I think that's where you

439
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:05,040
need to share it out if it's if it
doesn't apply outside or if it's hard to

440
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,720
determine whether it applies outside
then I think it's you know it's kind of

441
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,470
up to you whether your vehicle for doing
that though you know I discovered some

442
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:21,310
new form of exploit that maybe somebody
else or maybe an old form of expert but

443
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,400
I'm finding it pretty prevalent and I
just like to let the community know

444
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,300
about it

445
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,720
cbad what would you use as your vehicle
for letting the rest of the community

446
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:40,310
know that well maybe misunderstanding
your question but we will reach out to

447
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:45,870
whoever is affected if it's not us and
and work with them to get the the fixed

448
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,220
on it

449
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,220
then you know have a TV

450
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,780
ok

451
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,960
got it so the question is when you find
bugs in your own products do you do it

452
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,080
sounds V's do it so I think it depends
on the case there are some cases where

453
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:22,100
we do there's many cases where we don't
but what we're what we do do is we'll

454
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:32,520
put out an update and we'll assign it a
priority rating and make sure that

455
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,900
people did there's there are security
fixes in it

456
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:49,330
alright I will spare you freestyle
rapping yes please

457
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:57,520
so you talked about 10 testing and the
crowd sourced by 12 programs you didn't

458
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,270
really compare and contrast them do you
do how do you decide which how much you

459
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:09,670
do of either type you mix them much it
it depends so I think 11 area where

460
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,530
sometimes you can do both

461
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,790
you're gonna get different different
things so when you doing a traditional

462
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,800
pen test when you're bringing somebody
in should say when you bring somebody in

463
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,400
to do more of a white box and test
you're getting a different kind of data

464
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,440
in your bringing them in a different
point in the cycle so it can be really

465
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,320
helpful to augment your threat modeling
and to augment your code reviews that

466
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,110
kind of thing with with a white box pen
test when you want to do a live-fire

467
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:50,440
exercise that's when our crowds for a
spin test is is more valuable so the

468
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:58,090
other thing that can enter into the
picture is customers and the data that

469
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:04,380
they want if they want a traditional pen
test report to be shared with them then

470
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,350
you know having not available may be
valuable for a spin tests can provide a

471
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,480
letter of attestation as well it's just
it depends where your customers looking

472
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,480
for

473
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,330
alright

474
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,089
plenty of time to talk soon

475
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,040
all right thank you very much everyone
for coming
