1
00:08:48,950 --> 00:10:14,530
how many applications within the OWASP
top 10 taxonomy the first time it was

2
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,939
scanned with us and this is what you
wind up with its actually not a huge

3
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:27,200
variance between the worst and the best
of 76% failing in government on initial

4
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,690
submission and 58 in financial services
so it's not a huge range this is the

5
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,290
same data kinda presented the different
way so everybody else is kinda grouped

6
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,630
somewhere in the middle

7
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,210
this is only one way of looking at the
data obviously I was stuck in his one

8
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,330
lands to view that some industries may
not have as many weapons and other so it

9
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,810
may not be as relevant to them but
generally it's a good with that amount

10
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,209
of data is a reasonably safe

11
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:01,949
choice for taxonomy basically take from
this is that even the best performing

12
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,939
sector which is financial services is
failing for three out of five

13
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,259
applications if you work a lot with the
financial sector you know that they do

14
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:13,790
tend to be ahead of the curve in terms
of technology adoption in terms of

15
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,379
maturity of process of tools and all
those things and they're still doing

16
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:28,059
fairly badly against top 10 this is
really awful show of hands two things

17
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:32,459
flow density which is laws per megabyte
flaws per thousand lines of code of laws

18
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:40,248
person I'm unit measure is a valuable
thing to measure not a trick question do

19
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,089
people think it's valuable it actually
is but not in the way to a lot of people

20
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:49,559
use it a lot of our customers and
analysts and reporters and everybody

21
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,279
knows that we have this type of data
will ask us to measure to report on the

22
00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:00,470
identity so that they can say things
like this language is awful or you know

23
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:07,740
this industry sector is terrible what is
wrong with manufacturing and that's not

24
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,170
that's a misleading metric reason is
because that the programming language

25
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,248
itself has a significant impact there's
some language that you can accomplish a

26
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:19,589
lot in a very little bit of code so
therefore flooding to use gonna be

27
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:26,549
higher one example you seen this before
I know it straight ahead on xkcd but I

28
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:32,170
like the scope of this cartoon the point
here is the guys flying is like how did

29
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:38,229
you do that you know I used Python
import anti-gravity so the idea that you

30
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,360
can do a lot in very little code in
Python and you can imagine if you were

31
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,589
trying to implement anti-gravity in Java
it might take you ten thousand lines of

32
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,839
code instead of 10 that impacts are you
reporting flood density

33
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,019
back to the chart some languages like C
and C++ produce compiled code that's

34
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,350
really really high density and that
means that any industry or organization

35
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:06,480
that uses a lot of C and C++ C or C++
will have a higher prevalence of those

36
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,500
denser

37
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,950
higher flow density because of the
prevalence of those languages so I'm

38
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,090
giving you these industry comparison
numbers around london City and I'm

39
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,640
immediately kind of telling you don't
read too much into it I'll show you

40
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,910
later when we want to use for density
where it is valuable

41
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,370
it's not here but we have the data I
mean do you really think that

42
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,280
manufacturing is 23 times worse than
health care they might be better but I

43
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,750
really don't think there's that much of
a difference so this is this is what we

44
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,080
ended up in on the right there is just
the flood and see for very high and high

45
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,450
security flaws only when you read
something in an article or anywhere

46
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,670
really what they're talking about flood
and seeing if you save if they report

47
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,189
that manufacturing technology is really
bad like that just kind of keep that in

48
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,560
mind it really matters what types of
languages they're using to produce their

49
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,819
applications and that's a much more
bearing on on those numbers but this is

50
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:15,200
useful when you want to track over time
the number of flaws in the Odyssey

51
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,089
within a given population so for one
application for example that I'm doing

52
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,430
what's my flood and see today versus
what my flood and see a year from now

53
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,560
that's valuable it's the same
application I'm not conflicting any

54
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,849
other factors and I have a hundred
applications and I compare the density

55
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,620
of those same hundred applications a
year later that's useful so you want to

56
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,860
use it to track over time and we'll use
that to talk about remediation rates

57
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,790
later finally as far as industries go I
just wanted to show you a prevalence of

58
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,980
a few vulnerability categories across
different industry verticals a single

59
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,780
injection cross-site scripting have
consistently been at the top the list

60
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,449
for apps that clause cryptographic
issues around there because they've been

61
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,260
highlighted in recent years as being
relatively important things like partly

62
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,750
things like some of the global
vulnerability to come out we'll dig into

63
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,450
the mobile settle a bit later you may
notice that the numbers here are kind of

64
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,360
different from what you saw and Jeremiah
stock earlier he

65
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,560
single injection around 6% process
scripting lower than we have it and the

66
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,439
disparity for that is because of the
analysis type were looking mostly static

67
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,529
and dynamic and they're mostly dynamic
willing to internal applications as well

68
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:40,339
as public faces a public-facing only
that's both are actually correct but

69
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,920
keep in mind somebody says only 6% or
forty percent of applications are

70
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,920
vulnerable to steep injection think
about where that's coming from

71
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,370
precise answer my notes

72
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,140
so against equali scripting who's the
outlier their light blue line is

73
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,199
government so they're kind of standing
out as being significantly worse in

74
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,740
those categories cryptographic issues
were slightly different picture you have

75
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,660
health care out there on the far right
eighty percent of healthcare apps being

76
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,680
impacted by at least one public issue
and the rest kind of cluster around the

77
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,430
middle there with manufacturing kind of
being the best again there's a lot more

78
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,900
data than this in the full report I want
to call these particular examples

79
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:42,760
because these are categories that we all
know you're interested now want to slice

80
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,410
it differently sweet sliced by industry

81
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,430
let's take the same dataset and slice of
by language and see if there's anything

82
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:54,410
interesting that we come up with their
first just an understanding of the

83
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,949
dataset and there's not really any
conclusions you can draw from the start

84
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,040
but it is one of the show you over the
years we've done multiple volumes of

85
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,420
this report and of course the number of
applications has increased over time but

86
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,860
also the language distributions change
over time and this is mostly enterprise

87
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,889
and mid-market I'm not a lot lot of very
tiny software development shops here a

88
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,220
lot of enterprise and mid-market and
what you basically see from this really

89
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,910
the only thing to take from this is that
dot net appears to be on the rise in

90
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,580
enterprise development of two that's
about it so even though we've added a

91
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,050
lot more languages that we've supported
in the most recent analysis you still

92
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,360
see dotnet increasing as a as a
percentage share their so not that

93
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,179
surprising to anybody or not it's not
super surprising to me although you

94
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,710
might think enterprise would start
moving towards a no more not more modern

95
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,100
languages a bit more introverted
language of some of the trend your

96
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
language that you seeing but no one is
on the rise

97
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:06,090
the question is how much is how much is
that a representation of our customer

98
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,389
base that that all factors into it I
mean that they have a lot of customers

99
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,090
move that out a little bit but certainly
you know even if you bring on a new

100
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,228
customer they have 2010 NetApp's that's
not gonna move the needle very much

101
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:22,039
right so but yeah it's always that's
what kind of started with that yeah

102
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,710
there is a selection bias you went back
and slides ago you remember we compared

103
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,999
industries against their initial pass
rate against Nawaz policy here will do

104
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,960
that again except sliced by a language
that industry is not surprising to see

105
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,710
in C++ had a higher pass rate because
you don't really use seen C++ to write

106
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,220
web apps very often people still do and
there are some vulnerability in the US

107
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,669
top ten that can appear in on web
applications which is why you do still

108
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:57,470
have a 40 percent failure rate they're
the best fit for mobile sort of

109
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:05,359
client-side applications but they're in
there anyway my only conclusion from

110
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,349
this they can really draw from this i
think is that scripting languages you

111
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:15,029
help and I'm including classic SPME
legacy language really good classic ASP

112
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,619
PHP ColdFusion I really really go down
there near the bottom in doing really

113
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:29,789
really badly prevalence again except by
language now again you see the sequel

114
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,690
injection cross-site scripting or
significantly more prevalent in

115
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,629
applications that are ready and web
scripting languages like ASP ColdFusion

116
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:42,019
PHP compared to dot net job applications
done that is in the form of the dark

117
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,960
pink in jobs in green dark green
smoothies are not really surprising

118
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,259
maybe the numbers are surprising cuz
again when you compare them against

119
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,129
other reports that are being drawn from
different datasets different types of

120
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,259
analysis you do see drastically
different numbers we're still seeing

121
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,979
sequel injection around 30% of all
applications so again the application

122
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:09,460
having at least one occurrence of that
law scripting again

123
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,960
significantly higher in the 40 to 60%
really remember when I say at least

124
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
100,000

125
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:30,899
guess as to why this happens there are
fewer secure API is built into some of

126
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:35,149
these older languages I don't think
there's a way to parameterize queries in

127
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:39,559
classic ASP not positive they're
certainly not very many encoding

128
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:45,389
mechanisms built in ColdFusion didn't
start packaging East happy with the

129
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:48,729
computer release until maybe five or six
years ago the language has been around

130
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,730
for a decade and a half maybe longer

131
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:59,490
PHP even up until your PHP 45 you
couldn't do there was just no way to do

132
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,409
security things properly so you have to
roll your own people just wouldn't do

133
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:05,869
that when they do wrong

134
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,730
president net premature job is pretty
mature there are good options there so I

135
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,549
think that's kind of why you are you see
that question we asked get asked a lot

136
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,929
as which application technologies most
secure and so there's there's no real

137
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:27,029
answer to this the way to read the
charges again you've got your

138
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:31,330
programming language distribution shown
in the the bars and then the number on

139
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,309
the right there is the rank order of
what we showed the very beginning at

140
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,668
which industry was doing the best
interests of pass fail against their

141
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,559
policy so when you're here is that
there's no rhyme or reason there's no

142
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,700
number one clearly just has you know
none of this type of language and the

143
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,970
worst one has all the other day this is
not like it's all over the place look at

144
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:59,259
manufacturing there's the number two and
you know they've got their kind of

145
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,309
bucking that trend toward the java.net
dominance yet they're still doing you

146
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:11,269
know number two in terms of pass fail
rate on that initial submission so I

147
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,769
think that if there's any inherent
security disadvantage in language choice

148
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:21,570
I can probably be overcome with process
and program and things like that that's

149
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,850
all I can really take on this because I
don't see i don't see any direct

150
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,889
correlation between language choice and
how well the industry is doing based on

151
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:32,729
the day that we have

152
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:40,510
my this might take away and I can't
necessarily prove that but it's how I

153
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:46,750
think the data can be explained the
deepest that will go in terms of La

154
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,770
categories you consider that we actually
have individual CWE flaw categories

155
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,500
broken down instead of just generalize
descriptions but there's a lot of

156
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,640
scrutiny on mobile these days and
certainly in privacy and security and

157
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,210
these numbers always surprised me a lot
even though we get roughly the same

158
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,320
every time there's a breakdown of crypto
flaws in mobile apps only so iOS and

159
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,340
Android absolutely it's official
interview you're not using the right

160
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,129
random number generator ok that's not
surprising not as impactful of the times

161
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,299
they're just using that ran a number for
something that's not security critical

162
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,710
of some sort of not that's alarmed by
that won the second one on this list is

163
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,630
really alarming to me and that's
improper validation of SSL Certificates

164
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:41,179
the mobile app connects over SSL to a
server and it intentionally does not

165
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,160
validate whether that whether that
server certificate is valid with host

166
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,650
matches you know all those things you're
supposed to do to make sure that not

167
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,290
only is your traffic encrypted but
you're you're talking to who you think

168
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:59,080
your talking to 50% do not do that
correctly based on what we've seen which

169
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,439
is crazy I'm anecdotal evidence for
what's happening there

170
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:07,600
vast and developers only turn that off
in QA we forgot to turn it back on

171
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,400
we hear that a lot I don't think it
explains all of it but you know it's

172
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,740
kind of a new enough to go

173
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,140
specific server York you a story which
has a different name than all the other

174
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,090
servers and it's not as expensive to do
is just that it takes time and it's in

175
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,049
the logistical things and they could
turn it back on so these are the ones

176
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:31,750
are interesting but less interesting to
me 297 is crazy I think

177
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:38,550
ok so there are a lot of trucks and
grass to give you thirty seconds of cats

178
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:44,629
in various stages of co-development and
I'm gonna get back into the grass is

179
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,930
from the internet that appears to be
working on some sort of dynamic

180
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:56,480
simulation this cat is obviously way for
Skoda compile this cat is getting

181
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,110
started with coding but realizing the
C++ is a really really terrible option

182
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,360
these days

183
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,800
all right now we're back away get back
to it

184
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,730
remediation profiles raise this point in
this talk which is find all the stuff

185
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,970
you want if you don't fix it was the
point what are you doing so we talked a

186
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,890
lot about what we can find and now we
talk about what's getting fixed where

187
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,390
I'm really proud of we have this data
across all of our customers we found in

188
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:35,170
2015 we detected nearly 10 million laws
across our customer base and we know

189
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,780
definitively they fixed all across the
customer base they fix nearly seven

190
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,300
million of those which is really cool I
don't know that anybody else has that

191
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:49,020
kind of that kind of the cystic on that
was killed three million or not but some

192
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,520
of those again they may be things that
they don't agree with what they have

193
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,580
mitigating controls for any other reason
but still we know that seven out of 10

194
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,340
million to Lake yeah this is real I
should fix this I'm gonna do it and we

195
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,260
can verify that they did that that's
kind of cool so industry slice again who

196
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,210
does the the worst you just the best
here we have a much much wider

197
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,390
discrepancy between the best and the
worst are you surprised at all that its

198
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:22,370
manufacturing the comes out on top one
percent liberal media eighty-one percent

199
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:28,100
of what they find through us and then of
course the other end of the court the

200
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,080
other end of the spectrum government we
find a lot of its 27 percent of it

201
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,879
that's not so great is the same data so
there's a huge disparity in terms of

202
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:45,589
what's found versus what's fix and get
if you're only finding stuff you're

203
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:49,319
really not moving the needle at all
you're not making any more secure

204
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:52,949
you're not raising at a cost you're not
doing anything except being aware that

205
00:26:52,949 --> 00:27:00,249
you have more exposure just OK but
really help we're trying to think about

206
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:05,489
why would manufacturing you so much
better than i dont have the I have a

207
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:09,669
definitive answer but I think you think
about how manufacturing works and that

208
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:15,239
the history of the industry have a lot
of regulatory drivers if you think about

209
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:19,099
how they manage their supply chain of
parts and things like that logistics

210
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:25,129
they have their process improvement
built like very very tightly into their

211
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:31,488
culture they may have just better
policies run setting a Chivo goals I

212
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:34,249
don't know what it is I do think that
rigor around manufacturing and

213
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:38,539
operational efficiency and just always
trying to figure out how to getting

214
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:43,629
better at getting better is something
that not unique manufacturing but it

215
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,639
certainly prevalent there may be some
maybe more so than it is in healthcare

216
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:50,639
government was a comment

217
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:58,200
government officials who is going
government is all any government federal

218
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,070
state local that would be included in
federal so again it's only a slice of

219
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:10,658
the customers that we would have various
agencies let's all blended together

220
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:17,649
remember correlation is not causation
again we wanted to look at what is the

221
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:21,508
impact of remediation coaching to one of
the services that we offer to our

222
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:25,929
customers as part of their subscription
is the ability to do a scan of the

223
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,039
application but then also have somebody
do it without common in the pen testing

224
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,320
ruled that not common in the automated
analysis world that may be the only one

225
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,049
to do it

226
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,370
the idea is to take an hour you have
somebody walk you through the findings

227
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,518
answer some of your questions are what
is this type of what is the impact of

228
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,830
that I'm thinking about fixing it this
way you have a discussion basically

229
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,389
between security expert and a developer
and then they go up and they took some

230
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:56,340
issues and they make a rescan or
whatever but they've had some

231
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:03,110
consultation time with somebody and we
found that the impact of the remediation

232
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,658
coaching on on identity for a given
application so again only looking at one

233
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:14,850
application from point A to point B from
Stan number one and number two is

234
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,928
significant

235
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:21,919
we saw that when there was a readout
they reduced their flooded see by 42%

236
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,779
just not great but it's still better
than 17% there's a long way to go but

237
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,519
that's a two and a half times difference
is it because they have a readout I

238
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,309
don't know I would like it to be related
to the fact that these were read out but

239
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,899
it also may be that companies that
require developers to do without us also

240
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:47,018
set a higher bar for security there may
be may have stricter compliance regimes

241
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,549
there may be other factors at play here
but there is definitely a correlation

242
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:54,410
between having a readout and reducing
your flooded stand

243
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:02,320
busily remediating better so that was
interesting to us remember correlation

244
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,919
is not causation another thing we asked
or we sell to people as CBT based

245
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:13,810
e-learning line where various topics and
we thought it'd be interesting to

246
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,090
measure the impact of e-learning on
remediation raise this we do they had

247
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,120
just the customer have that or do they
not have it and how does that look

248
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,120
across their application portfolio as a
whole

249
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:36,990
now there's a lot of factors here but if
you hadn't even subscription you fixed

250
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:43,090
75% of the stuff that we found if you
didn't you fix 58% again these are

251
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:50,580
averages and a lot of other factors here
again some developers like you might

252
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,129
have enough you might have an e-learning
subscription and developers might not

253
00:30:54,130 --> 00:31:02,140
use it one developer might use it and
the rest might not right back with you

254
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,110
have any learning subscription may also
mean you're upset program is much more

255
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,780
mature than somebody else's ok so
there's all these other factors that

256
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,129
kind of play into it I would like to
think I have always wanted to be able to

257
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,820
prove that training you learn in
whatever form it took would improve

258
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,379
security thing anyone has been able to
prove that yet there is a correlation

259
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,940
but just in case you don't get that I
didn't make the claim that security

260
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,370
training results in more secure software
I know it's a very contentious then the

261
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,030
last thing we want to look at the pics
rate by analysis types I mention we do

262
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,190
static analysis dynamic analysis we even
have been testers that allows

263
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,380
applications to the traditional way that
you that your way and we did find the

264
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,750
remediation rates were highest for
static analysis not a huge amount higher

265
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,830
we think that probably has something to
do with the fact that that analysis you

266
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,850
get line of code filename you get the
point to the exact root cause of where

267
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,820
the flock hardware as dynamic or or pen
test you have to figure it out

268
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,750
of your developer you know that pretty
well you'll probably be able to figure

269
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,470
out what was statically point you right
at where it is this is where you make

270
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,510
that six that's my best guess there so
we did see a little bit of a variance

271
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:22,870
their last section doesn't directly
related to the study but I wanted to

272
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,959
include it as a take away because I know
that a lot of people here are

273
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,780
responsible for cybersecurity your own
company and I don't like to just throw a

274
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,629
bunch of data without also giving at
least something to take away so this

275
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:43,870
stuff is not in the report and give you
a quick story again around the time of

276
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,010
World War one

277
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:51,530
only seven percent of American
households own toothpaste and the army

278
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:56,210
had just enacted the draft at that point
they are finding this so many recruits

279
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,490
came into the army with terrible dental
hygiene that they actually declared poor

280
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,150
dental hygiene and national security
risk

281
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,190
think about that ww1 ok

282
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,320
around the same time elsewhere in
private industry men employed Hopkins

283
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,939
was hired by accident

284
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,410
to pass complete to design a national ad
campaign so he had to find something

285
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,740
that would make people want to brush
their teeth more often remember seven

286
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,600
percent of households in toothpaste so
he went he read Dental Studies he read

287
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,050
text books you read all these things of
the dental literature which must have

288
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:36,930
been thrilling and he found something he
could use him he is keen on this thing

289
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,110
called amusing plaques which is this a
film that that accumulates on the teeth

290
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:47,729
over time and he renamed that he latched
onto that is all the film dingy yellow

291
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,060
film like it's really gross because of
appeal to the public's narcissistic

292
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:57,129
tendencies by reframing president not as
a health care thing but as a beauty aid

293
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:05,360
and what this kid was defined a simple Q
and behavior and a reward for the Q was

294
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,520
everyone's got this film building on her
teeth that triggers why should brush my

295
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,380
teef and the reward I get for that as
well I'm gonna be prettier according to

296
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,540
these ads within weeks

297
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,699
of these ads going out and couldn't
handle the demand for the toothpaste

298
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:28,678
within three years they were in
international product and within 10

299
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,400
years

300
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,060
sixty-five percent of American
households owned a tube of toothpaste

301
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,489
and yes military downgraded that dental
hygiene is a security risk thing as a

302
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:43,799
great marketing success story what have
you without sex I think that we have to

303
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,450
start thinking like Hopkins the
marketing genius and we're doing

304
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,509
marketing to a certain degree we have to
think about that in terms of getting

305
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,600
developers to build habits around
application security in the same way

306
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,640
that he tried to get them to build
habits room brushing their teeth whether

307
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,430
that's remembered to scan your codebase
every night or whether it's simply

308
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,339
following a security checklist every
time you launch a new feature whatever

309
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,800
it is a daily task a routine task is
going to be something that's more

310
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,230
habit-forming then let's say a security
activity that happens once a year like a

311
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:24,510
pen test if you could raise the level of
security hiding in the same way that you

312
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,840
raised the level of dental hygiene that
would be really really amazing we all

313
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,870
know that security lighting is not
really that great right now but the fact

314
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:37,490
is this was successful because it was
habit-forming got in people's heads and

315
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,180
they just got used to doing something
you would even imagine if not brushing

316
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,750
your teeth today so I don't have a one
size fits all approach about how you

317
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,250
apply to security today but I do know
that you have to think about your

318
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,910
culture the moving parts in your
organization and figure out where you

319
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:57,560
can where you can get developers forum
habits really touched on this but the

320
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,680
fact that you know if you're only focus
on how much you can scan as opposed to

321
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,399
how much are fixing you really don't do
much about the problem it seems silly to

322
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,790
say that you know I have to remind
people that remediation should be a

323
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,380
focus of a program but in many cases
it's not many very large organizations

324
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,930
are much more scan focused and
remediation focused and so how do you

325
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:23,029
make that push may be amended to read up
for its can maybe you have better

326
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,960
officers through security group so that
it's it's less difficult for developers

327
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,230
to actually make that

328
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,500
changed you lower the barrier 22 making
fixes again depends a lot on the

329
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,100
organization maybe you import all your
security bugs into the same bug tracking

330
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,868
system the developers use to fix all the
other bugs so they've already got a

331
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,950
habit around that write a check

332
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:52,200
secure behavior reward you checked your
every morning for every hour they do it

333
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,520
your behaviour you fix some bugs whether
their regular issue is whether the

334
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,140
security bugs and it rewards you get to
mark the tickets is closed developers

335
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,759
love to mark tickets is closed so this
is a good way of getting getting a habit

336
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,109
formed around remediation as well

337
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:13,049
last one is just remember to measure you
don't Peter Drucker's kind of given

338
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,230
credit for being the founder of modern
management philosophy and this is one of

339
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:21,230
his many quotes it is if you're paying
attention to something it's actually

340
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,510
help you improve in those areas unless
you're kind of actively sabotaging it

341
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,440
you're going to improve if you're
looking at your measuring so it's

342
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,930
sometimes hard to see minor progress
objectively but if you're measuring it

343
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,330
you can take credit for it you know if
you got your one percent better or 5

344
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,210
percent better you may not notice that
unless you're actually writing it down

345
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,140
to measure it

346
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,240
number three is kind of measure early
measure often so repeat those three

347
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,490
takeaways number one is form habits find
a way to form habits get the developers

348
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:55,368
for Mohamed's number two is focused on
remediation number three is three

349
00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:00,510
metrics that's the takeaway only be with
you can get all the information that I

350
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,859
presented to us a lot more in the status
office key report on our website very

351
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:10,040
calm that's all I have to present to you
today but I'll be having to take

352
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,040
questions if you have any

353
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:29,399
remediation was wondering what you're
giving me so one of the things that

354
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,220
we've known as a guy I work for a
company that's a software vendor that

355
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,799
sells for the federal government and
they are probably the most strictest

356
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,890
customer we have in terms of you know
how quickly respond in and they can't

357
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,180
hold us to the letter of the law with
respect to our support policy terms of

358
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:53,049
fixing vulnerabilities you know that you
know mediating volatility so in other

359
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:58,410
words I mean I kind of see them as the
toughest customer for us but why the

360
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:04,220
disparity remediating yeah well we don't
always practice what we preach they may

361
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:10,270
be so I mean government is more mature
government in manufacturing I think or

362
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,359
more mature in terms of how they think
about software supply chain and we've

363
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,040
seen that and that's what you're
experiencing right as a vendor they're

364
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,700
saying what you have to do these things
before we will accept your software

365
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,930
whether we're still approve the contract
or whatever right that doesn't mean

366
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,868
they're doing it for themselves they
have a lot of legacy software they have

367
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,210
a lot of applications that are built ten
years ago fifteen years ago that are

368
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:39,070
still being used for like business
critical things but there may not be any

369
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,359
developers against them I mean a lot of
times it's not that they don't want to

370
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,480
fix it they just don't have the
resources to fix it we don't have a way

371
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,760
to to gauge that I don't have a query I
can make that can answer that but

372
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,330
anecdotally yeah we know that you know
they don't they don't recycle it they

373
00:39:55,330 --> 00:40:01,580
don't develop you know at the same pace
and the same intensity that happens and

374
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,040
commercial space and they hold onto
things for a lot longer so that's my

375
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,470
best guess is you're saying because they
move really slowly on upgrading and

376
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,250
those kinds of things are kind of they
might have good

377
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,470
requirements in terms of mature
requirements but they actually don't

378
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,439
know how to do not have a mechanism to
implement yeah I think I think a lot of

379
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,380
that is it

380
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,420
they also may have a lot stronger
vetting process before like to to clear

381
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,319
something for an upgrade which is I
think plays into the passion thing as

382
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:28,279
well right

383
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:32,579
gotta do it you gonna make sure nothing
nothing fails in any particular way and

384
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:38,049
that just draws out the the testing
cycle whereas you know a software shop

385
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:42,910
software vendor this doing like DevOps
Riedel scrum they'll do the facts and

386
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,470
the law pushed out in the next sprint
and it'll be done in two weeks or a week

387
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:57,689
or whatever so I think it has a lot to
do with that thanks to questions

388
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,109
number one was a man you know you're
doing the results of the readouts had

389
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:06,269
you know better fixed rates you guys
intend to ask your customers do this in

390
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:10,970
measure if there's an improvement after
you ask them to implement a system like

391
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:18,660
this and see if it actually get a direct
correlation well so what we showed

392
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,480
actually was that that is what we showed
and what we're not able to do we're not

393
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,200
able to make the causation argument
because it's impossible to isolate all

394
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,009
the other factors right it's impossible
to run this sort of controlled

395
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:39,880
experiment without significant customer

396
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:48,910
little ones that you know we're doing it
and you ask them to do it so i mean you

397
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,859
can't make nothing else change but
ideally they weren't right before and

398
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:56,328
now they are one of the major difference
and that's and that is what the data

399
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:00,789
shows I mean it's two and a half times
improved across the board but we just

400
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:04,000
don't know if that if there are other
program maturity thing the factor into

401
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,470
that is just it's difficult to isolate
ok and my second question is unusual and

402
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,299
how you knew like about ten million

403
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,330
vulnerabilities and about seven million
for the three remaining ones are they

404
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:21,330
like sitting percent of those are
government because they don't remediate

405
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,170
as fast right so I don't know I don't
have the breakdown on what was not text

406
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:31,040
you can that'd probably does you can
probably extrapolate that pretty closely

407
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,750
what you find in those three million are
a higher prevalence of the low or very

408
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,370
low severity for us you certainly
wouldn't certainly see companies fixing

409
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,620
the high and very high security things
faster which you would expect they made

410
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:51,700
us not get to the lows they may find
that they may decide that the business

411
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,259
criticality of the application with the
worth of the data that's being struck by

412
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,250
the application is not worth the cost of
picks there's a lot of reasons why

413
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,500
people choose not to fix things they did
it does tend to be the lower severity

414
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,220
things maybe the applications going to
be into lived maybe you know there's a

415
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,529
lot of there's a lot of reasons and then
some of the things just maybe issues of

416
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,730
the choose not to fix in the code but
they choose to fix by some control

417
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,320
that's outside of the software itself
that we can actually see so we scanned

418
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,980
again it appears that the flaw is still
there let's make let's say maybe they

419
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,250
put in a specific blocking rule in their
way to prevent an attack or something

420
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,640
like that we would see that is fixed
even though from their perspective it is

421
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,750
fixed that's about the amount of
disability that we get into the

422
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,390
remediation served over there

423
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:46,299
remediation coaching you couldn't tell
for sure if it was helping

424
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,000
have you ever had the case we had a
company one year they didn't use it and

425
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,110
then the next year they started using it
and compare the two years right we we

426
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:59,160
don't have any classes why is clean is
that unfortunate that would be awesome

427
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,859
usually what happens is as we on board a
customer we push really hard for them to

428
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,240
do read out for at least their first few
times Sudha so there they understand

429
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:15,330
what's available to them but so too then
say like alright stop doing it for years

430
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:20,480
not doing it for six months and then
start doing it again is kind of it it

431
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,140
would appear to be not in their best
interests and they would just be the

432
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,420
guinea pig but like what would they get
out of that we would get great data but

433
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:33,890
I think it would probably not be the
best advice I could give them are we

434
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:44,069
have one more time how do we know if
they fix the final now well this Lee

435
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,270
when we do ask an analysis we're doing a
whole program analysis and we're looking

436
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:51,170
for particular patterns in the code so
for example of legal injection will see

437
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,940
a piece of user-supplied data for burst
through the application and eventually

438
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,770
we'll get to a database call when it's
used in an insecure way so we can at the

439
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,430
first time we see those patterns we mark
all those patterns we scan it the second

440
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,879
time we don't find that again we can
correlate you know the first set of

441
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,470
results for the second quarter results

442
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:16,069
anything that doesn't show up the second
time we assumed to be fixed I think the

443
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,120
pattern doesn't lag again so that's
that's were using to determine if this

444
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,029
unexpected just don't detect it anymore
which is mostly accurate

445
00:45:25,029 --> 00:45:27,829
alright that's a great time thank you
