1
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,579
well thanks everyone for coming here I'm
Carter and this is talk of workforce

2
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:35,610
it'll and we talked about being in
security and let's get to it so I'm

3
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,510
gonna cover such a high level stuff or
business level and then dive down toward

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,659
the end of the talk and see some more
technical analysis which includes a

5
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:57,760
demonstration in hacking so senior
security consultant at Central

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,289
previously did security research and
husbands always learning a lot of music

7
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,960
particularly anything tech now and I
like playing video games and I like

8
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,610
hacking them after I played them
sometimes if I can play them very well

9
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,000
then I just hacked them from the get-go
that's how I got here is they're really

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,280
fun I love playing video games and
they're really hard to win so I was left

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,409
with two options when playing them if I
wanted to win I had either practice a

12
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:37,229
whole bunch takes so much time or just
she decided she and that's just how I

13
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:45,500
learned hack in in the end that ended
with a security career so it started off

14
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,600
with hacking side scrollers I was
playing multi multiplayer online

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,969
role-playing game massively multiplayer
and saw somebody finer on the screen and

16
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,380
that's not normally a thing you can't do
that in this game and how they do that

17
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,310
so I googled around how do you how do
you fly I gotta fly in this game and

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,519
followed you tutorials and they said ok
download this program run there's change

19
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,640
this by do that and that was all reverse
engineering I didn't know it at the time

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,220
I just thought it was flying in a game
so eventually

21
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,099
the screen and it was really fun and I
loved it was addicting and I had to get

22
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:30,060
more of it and that's what led my career
and security is so much crossover

23
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,640
between video game hacking and the
security industry in general there's

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,119
there's la crosse crossover between
skill sets such as things that you need

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,010
to do when you're performing threat
modeling for instance achieving a goal

26
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,719
and and having an objective and working
toward that goal in a very systematic

27
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,230
way is also reverse engineering at play

28
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,870
there's a lot of that with with game
hacking there's also more specific

29
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,400
network protocol analysis that has
elements of reverse engineering as well

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,769
so that's all well and good but then
then when you look at it like okay so

31
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,000
there's cheating right but then there's
so much more to it

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,260
video game hacking in the video games
and video games in general it's not just

33
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,888
about cheating you gotta gotta look at
the full stack of a system i mean

34
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,979
there's there's the whole there's
there's the servers involved there's the

35
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:31,479
game clients there's the network there's
customer service representatives who you

36
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,319
call up and then you get some of it you
know you figure out some information

37
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,429
about a player if you want if you want
their account and their high-level

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,810
player you want to take over their
account you get either attack the

39
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,819
servers or you could just call up
customer service and say hey I'm that

40
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,548
player give me their account information
use a little social engineering so it's

41
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,019
not necessarily technical and so
analyzing the video game you know a

42
00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:01,669
whole stack is a threat modeling
exercise seeing who what things an

43
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,879
attacker when assets an attacker can go
after and seeing how they would go after

44
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,310
him you've also got to identify those
risks as well as any existing controls

45
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,859
or protections that are in place and
identify maybe some gaps in the control

46
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,289
see where you can help fill in those
gaps to the to protect those those

47
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,690
assets they're important here

48
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,889
video game there's also reverse
engineering taking apart the client may

49
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,979
be the server is available maybe it's an
open source server that you can analyze

50
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:37,240
sometimes this is the case you can also
analyze the network protocol itself and

51
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,309
figure out how the claims in the server
interact with each other that's kind of

52
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:50,110
an overview that applies to video games
in general and we're going to dive into

53
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:58,219
the risks the business risks are
cyclical let's say they if if a video

54
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,550
game gets hacked

55
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,059
hits the news and that's not good for a
company it causes brand tournament which

56
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:08,529
then leads to players not wanting to
play the game because if if you're not

57
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,879
protecting your game then there's a
bunch of hackers running around and then

58
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,770
just it loses its fun appeal it's just
not is not as fun if everybody's really

59
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,198
in the game so then if this happens
repeatedly the customers will become

60
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,490
disloyal if if let's say the
intellectual property is still in the

61
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,669
game content the source code let's say
that to the server is still on your eye

62
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:36,688
peas ripped off that's that's gonna
cause loss of revenue so there's a lot

63
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:43,009
of things that play rather than just
cheating there's there's ways that

64
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,379
attackers will target various games
based off of these business model select

65
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:54,139
premium subscription vs one-time payment
games where you only have to buy the

66
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,369
game and complained forever so premium
models the risks might be that you get

67
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:06,649
to get the in-game items for free that
the pre paid only game benefits lot of a

68
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,990
lot of them have Pro features are
premium items or whatever they are and

69
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,459
if you get those for free then the
freemium business model fails similar

70
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,509
with subscription-based if you can play
the game without having to pay a

71
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,399
subscription you're gonna lose money and
lastly with one-time payments lot of

72
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,019
times these types of games are blocked
by Diaa im so if you can bypass that

73
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:35,419
piracy well as a whole session about
that but piracy will happen

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,430
and then DRM plays a role in that

75
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,440
so it's time in the technical aspects so
there's technical risks such as accounts

76
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,870
getting hijacked or i dont in the game
being stolen from other players that's

77
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,639
not a good thing you want to protect
against that cheating animation botting

78
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,039
so let's say there's repeated attacks
that are done in the game in order to

79
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,090
get progress throughout the levels of
whatever the game as if you can automate

80
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:13,049
that you know I used to do this and boot
up my program and I go to bed and in the

81
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,599
morning I had just cranked up you know
fifty levels and where is all the other

82
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,630
people were 50 levels behind his head
actually sleep so that's that's not

83
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,919
something that you want to permit in
your day in generally I do not have

84
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,919
service if you can't play the game
that's a problem

85
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,318
ride in the Virtual Academy economy some
games are pretty cool they actually

86
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,669
allow fried steak place it's part of the
game whereas most games don't like that

87
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:51,250
so so more than the realistic sim games
sometimes there will be some situations

88
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,699
where if if one player lies and reps
offered cheats or hacks their way into

89
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,199
getting another player's currency that's
that's part of the game

90
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,990
deal with it but most of the time that's
not the case and also the game game

91
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,389
itself like we said previously

92
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:15,360
piracy is something that most companies
are gonna lie on board so that the risks

93
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,819
as well the business risks will vary by
game genre so first person shooter is

94
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,840
gonna have different is gonna have
crossover it's also gonna have differing

95
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,330
risks then say

96
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,740
an online role-playing game so bragging
rights and competitive advantage you're

97
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,260
gonna be huge goals of attackers playing
a first-person shooters they might do

98
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,179
this by staff planning or creating a
boxer wallhack so that they can see

99
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:45,209
through walls and gain some advantage
over other players as opposed to playing

100
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:51,180
the game fairly whereas online
role-playing games you might if there's

101
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,870
a player that's invested $1,000 into a
game account and they've got three level

102
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,200
hundred whatever characters that are
that are highly envied among the rest of

103
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,440
the clans somebody's gonna want them and
they might actually try and hack into

104
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,180
maybe former something in it from a web
web server into the internal network in

105
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,870
order to compromise the game server so
that they can get the account like

106
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,010
there's so many different ways we can do
this there's private servers where an

107
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,140
attacker would avoid paying
subscriptions and then real-time

108
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,990
strategy games for those of you who
played sometimes the maps don't have

109
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,670
full visibility and you can gain
advantage by seeing all of the players

110
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,810
movements and resources at a time as
opposed to a lot of games where you have

111
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,689
to send out scouts have to constantly be
monitoring ok do I have an up-to-date

112
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,899
version of where my enemy is in the
game's progression you see it all the

113
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,370
time that's a huge advantage to you and
then by platform

114
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,360
the gaming platform console mobile
window you know when is like Linux Mac

115
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,540
web browsers all that they're gonna see
varying types of attacks against those

116
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,589
and you're gonna see varying forms of
protection against those say with a web

117
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,820
based game you're gonna see a lot more
service I protection hopefully you're

118
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,190
gonna see service ID protection in in
all the games but you're gonna see it

119
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,440
valued a lot more by the developer of a
web based game because they can be

120
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,019
hacked the browser is not really you
just make your own browser like you can

121
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,480
make it do whatever you want you send
the data that you want to stand a chance

122
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,899
as well as game consoles those those
require much more specific skill set and

123
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:49,610
you've got a sometimes you've got to be
able to D sauter and manipulate bits and

124
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,720
bytes as they're perfectly time it and
there's a lot more to it so they're

125
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,820
going to focus their protections more on
the client site itself meaning the game

126
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,639
console are going to rely on the
protection in the console not always the

127
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,740
case but this tends to happen

128
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,320
video game assets are going back to the
threat modeling example or process

129
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,230
rather we get a video game assets that
are game content the patches the

130
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,360
downloadable content that sort of stuff
player account information billing

131
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,980
information that's that's always
interesting if if you're you've got five

132
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,459
million subscribers to your game you've
got five million people using some form

133
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,430
of payment which means five million
targets to rip them off if you gained

134
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,459
access to that billing information so
you want to protect that it's there

135
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,160
there's fraud and cheap cheap

136
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,660
the detection data itself it's telling
you whether or not people are cheating

137
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,550
that could be an asset because if you
identify that there's this this

138
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,380
monitoring process that sending back
data saying yeah this person's cheating

139
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,010
he just killed that process are you
modify that data even though you're

140
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:09,019
cheating that sheet data itself is
invalid so that's an asset and we

141
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,410
already mentioned customer service
representatives for their actions that

142
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,740
you could compromise so then there's we
just ask I discuss the things that

143
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,730
attackers can target these are some of
the things you can you can use to

144
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,600
protect those things that attackers
would go after so you can use encrypted

145
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,910
protocols such as VPN tunnels or anti
tampering mechanisms on the game client

146
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:40,310
is very common you can monitor for
certain security events you can say hey

147
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,959
if players moving at fifty times the
speed they're supposed to

148
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,020
then something's probably up there not
supposed to be able to do that and you

149
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,819
can do and this is part of cheap fun
analysis you can also do I P

150
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:59,820
whitelisting for certain applications if
if if if appropriate a lot of times this

151
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,840
will help curb attacks so that's where
the technical risks getting into the

152
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:14,060
attack and defense so there's there's
the silver bill silver bullet approach

153
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:22,290
now works not alot you want to rely on a
layered approach so there's relying on a

154
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,140
single control that it's just it's not
get it might work in certain situations

155
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,819
but it's not going to work in the long
run you want to have let's take for

156
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,580
example if i if if I'm going to protect
using a layered approach layered

157
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,800
protection approach to protect premium
items and in the mobile games say that I

158
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,420
shouldn't be able to get the last
remaining money through some payment

159
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,660
method I could I could or maybe let's
say it's a premium in-game item for a

160
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,469
desktop I shouldn't be able to reverse
the client's you want to make it

161
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,230
difficult for attackers to reverse the
client's the client that's used to make

162
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:08,920
that to use the premium items say so
that way that I couldn't modify the

163
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,870
client to say hey I'm using this app
created item even though I don't have

164
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,120
the upgraded item it wouldn't make sense
if if if I could modify that but let's

165
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,340
say let's say that you've got an attempt
recovered your good game can be reversed

166
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,980
which it always can but let's say that
it's really really difficult so then I'm

167
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,780
gonna as an attacker I'm gonna go to the
next layer down which would be the

168
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,890
network encryption or the network Claire
and I'm just gonna send spoofed packets

169
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:41,069
and any use the game client avoided
entirely so then if you make it if they

170
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,410
if you make the network encrypted can be
a lot more difficult than sending

171
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,170
plaintext traffic as an attacker I can
sniff the liar and see the plaintext

172
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,160
just go right by and say I'm gonna get
myself unlimited whatever and and as an

173
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,140
IT as a defender if you encrypted that
day it would have been a lot harder for

174
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:06,080
an attacker to sniff that and replicated
similarly server-side checks are very

175
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,610
useful for identifying it say the game
plan says I can use a premium item gain

176
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,530
whatever effects he would get a simple
server-side check to make sure the

177
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,900
person actually purchase that item is a
quick fix for this but that wouldn't

178
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,140
necessarily

179
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,319
doesn't necessarily happen on these
games people just assume well if I can

180
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,340
send the data that says I'm using it
then I must not always the case

181
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,300
taking the offensive approach the
offense but there's the general hacking

182
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,839
process like I said of thinking of a
goal like getting unlimited health or

183
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,990
getting access to certain restricted
parts of a map so that I can or major

184
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:59,420
performing power hours and moves in
whatever level 80 moves might be out

185
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,329
there that I can

186
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:05,089
not perform at lower levels you know if
I'm a little 15 character and I'm

187
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:11,119
performing set that's way outta my
league should be a red flag so so that I

188
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:15,540
would pick as a goal and then I would
plan out how I want to reach that goal

189
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,748
goal and taking going through the layers
of security here you can modify the game

190
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:28,660
at runtime the client runtime or on disk
depending on the protections in place

191
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,059
one might be easier than the other or
find out how to send spoof network

192
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:39,499
packets to the server or look for
serologic flies and general so then you

193
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,329
execute the attack but it's it's a very
methodical approach as opposed to just

194
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:50,138
jumping in and saying hello hackett so
let's say there is this game for those

195
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:53,989
of you who are familiar with ghost in
the shell code they had a CTF in 2015

196
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:59,209
and was called Coney Island Adventure
three and some you use that as an

197
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:08,000
example here for how to get unlimited
ammo or or just just not the unlimited

198
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,349
ammo quite yet we'll get to that in the
town but just in general I how how would

199
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:15,688
i hack the game so I would find out how
to modify the client I wanted to pursue

200
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,899
one of these goals like like I know that
ammo and I can use a game trainer that I

201
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:23,619
can create or it can find tools
available that provide this

202
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,479
functionality pretty easily and this
works because there's no anti tampering

203
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:35,840
mechanism so if there was any
obfuscation or any sort of encryption at

204
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,510
the game client or any any form
protection this wouldn't be as easy as

205
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:47,379
it is or find out how to send spoofed
network packets of the game sir you

206
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,760
proxy traffic so assuming let's assume
that they

207
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,730
the client to sell the game client was
protected it would be possible to proxy

208
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,919
network traffic so instead of so instead
of saying the game

209
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,850
connects to

210
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,370
the end server you would say the game
actually connects to your proxy which

211
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,570
then sends it off to the server and then
you modify all the traffic in between

212
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:16,570
that way you get around the whole issue
of the game client being protected or

213
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:23,389
you can look for service ID laws itself
perhaps check to see whether or not the

214
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,750
same account that you claim to have is
what the server actually thinks you have

215
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,040
and if it if that does if that check is
not performed then you've got you've

216
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:41,720
you've got a winning situation in this
case there's one little fly if if in the

217
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,890
case of this this game the game server
is released it was it's already been

218
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,370
released so as an attacker I can see him
in a host this game is great

219
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,479
come join it i've got i've got all the
perks you want and I just happened to

220
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,850
give myself unlimited rights or whatever
and this is this would be the case for

221
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,020
an administrative user it makes sense
but sometimes there's other common games

222
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,870
out there where you run your own you run
your own client and it's assumed what

223
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:18,350
you can't have the client so you can as
somebody who's hosting a local LAN party

224
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,510
you have complete control of everything
and you can you can give yourself

225
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,690
unlimited advantage whereas your team
members might be restricted by what the

226
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,750
server itself is checking for team and
enemies so getting unlimited ammo and in

227
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:40,970
in this game is simply performed by
identifying where in memory is the AM

228
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,790
ammunition stored it stored at that
address that I'm not gonna read to you

229
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:52,830
and I have 29 and my my my clip then I'm
going to identify the instruction that

230
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,710
points to that address for their rights
to that address these me so every time I

231
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,840
pull the trigger to fire a bullet that
am account goes down so what's changing

232
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,669
that that an account that address right
there it's a move instruction in

233
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,900
assembly for those who are familiar with
it

234
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,910
and then I take that since I control the
game clients or I can't control the

235
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,330
server whatever we're attacking here I'm
going to modify that instead of

236
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:27,760
documenting the the M account which
cannot do anything I do know on which is

237
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,470
no operation and so that's the debate 90
right there on the far right it does

238
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,640
nothing so instead of doing something
which would be the detriment of the an

239
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,750
account that you absolutely nothing and
therefore I get unlimited ammo that's

240
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,660
how it works

241
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,990
gonna show how that happens here

242
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:04,668
alright so let's say right here we see
over here I've got thirty ammunition and

243
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:11,900
then I'm gonna open up my game trainer
here is available online by the way for

244
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,429
those who want to define it

245
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:19,070
constitution's pretty useful so I'm
going to search for that M account that

246
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,730
I have which was 30 so I perform the
search and it narrows it down

247
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:30,549
narrows it down for me to 87,000
addresses not really great for what i

248
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:39,260
mean you need a little more specifics so
I switched back to the game client and

249
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:46,530
fireball it goes to 29 so I search for
29 and then a performance can I see the

250
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,820
only one address out of that previous
list there are held the value 30

251
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,389
addresses I find now out of that list
there's only one at this point in time

252
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,820
that hasn't value 29 so I know I've
identified my

253
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:10,169
am account but i just want to make sure
I'm gonna change it to 28 look em

254
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:14,650
account now it's twenty now look over
here at sixteen a bump it up to 30

255
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:21,880
switchback 35 just modified the AM
account of this game pretty cool

256
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,390
problem is if I'm running around
shooting everybody and doing my thing

257
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,970
I'm not gonna want to switch back and
forth over and over and over and over

258
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,429
that's not gonna be fun be better to
just run around actually finally amal

259
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:38,280
itself and it do that so what do is
attach to bugger

260
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:48,850
on that address that says okay break on
break the client has caused the client

261
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:56,529
to just stop executing if that address
has something written to it so I do that

262
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:03,679
a fireball and I see an address pops up
and that's that move instruction that we

263
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,580
showed earlier and it moves around and
basically that's what decreases the ammo

264
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:18,320
so what I do here as I opened up my
disassembler I say I'm gonna change that

265
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,428
to the no operation that we previously
discussed and now when I go back to the

266
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:30,929
game client now that there's a bunch of
new operations when I fire the bullet

267
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:38,720
fired the gun doesn't actually decreased
the alcohol so that's how I am very very

268
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,470
simple unlimited ammo hack would be
performed now this is not taking into

269
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:50,190
account any thing like service ID checks
or anything like this is assuming that

270
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:56,639
the server doesn't check anything like
that I'm jumping around showing you how

271
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:06,580
high can jump how fast I can move HDI I
I gotta go fast and this so I made some

272
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:13,070
scripts because I i cant wait im not not
patient I wanna I wanna have moon jump

273
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,210
in on have super speed I would have
unlimited ammo and I can jump a little

274
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,950
higher that's by doing the same type
types of type of process I can go a lot

275
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:28,289
faster I can run around to all sorts of
kind of things but this is simply by

276
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:34,940
modifying the game plan and this stuff
is normally possible now look at how

277
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,659
fast that bear it took forever to to to
shoot the bear down so I'm gonna just

278
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:46,119
bump up how much death and damage the
rifle does so that instead of having to

279
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,459
stay

280
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,580
for a whole like two seconds I just
fired one bullet is gone it's just it

281
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:58,980
just makes my life a lot better but the
thing is I haven't done this little

282
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:09,930
check for health so as I got this game
going excuse me I'm showing you here I

283
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:15,630
got ahead of myself so we've got a few
of the guns and things in the game that

284
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,230
I've show I'm showing you here at the
bottom

285
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,890
we've got how much damage it normally
does and that's like eight be damaged

286
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:31,110
during its all be damaged so the value
being Hexis like 11 or something and so

287
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,979
instead of that I bump it up to 100 as a
whole bunch of zeros so it's a lot more

288
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,700
damage and do that for all the guns are
a few of them I think there's more in

289
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:53,640
the game as you can see their hopes and
go back a little meant the well it

290
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,630
showed that it did a lot of damage and
you can see that when I just fire

291
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:03,610
single-bullet you can also see that my
health is it 19999 it's because I've

292
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,750
enabled this little modification where
I've searched you can see it kinda jump

293
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:14,180
down the 789 799 when mother bear comes
over it goes down 2959 sometimes that's

294
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,460
because I have this health lot to what
I'm doing is like every 50 milliseconds

295
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:28,280
I'm resetting the value at an address to
999 so if I unset it when you see my

296
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:34,110
house go down real fast and I like that
so I freeze my health in a bit higher

297
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,120
value

298
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:48,889
yeah so then the Bears but I it's still
kinda slow for me i'm not i'm not happy

299
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:55,290
with it being so slow I can only jump as
high over tree to me that's just kinda

300
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:01,100
boring I mean it's not the greatest so
in this game you can actually walk on

301
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,620
water that's not a hack so I'm going to
enable super moon jump and super speed

302
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,189
and then you can go a little bit higher
and these are just modifications I mean

303
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,900
I'm doing some simple floating-point
modifications you can find all this

304
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:24,000
online I get her car Jones and it got a
little detail thing that you can

305
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,990
download mess with the basically that's
how you have a game plan assuming that

306
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,840
the server side doesn't check this sort
of stuff you're free to fly around and

307
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,820
it's this is a tremendous players have
they can I mean I was able to jump out

308
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,129
of the starting point the starting point
of the game is kinda like your little

309
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:49,840
cave and just jump out of it and don't
have to do any of that you know starter

310
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,060
stuff I can just run around and have fun
so thats

311
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:15,139
and then going over to notice when I did
the unlimited health in this game I had

312
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,510
to freeze the value if I had made it so
that

313
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,390
documenting the health was impossible
saying you know using the same technique

314
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:29,290
as the gun ammo everyone in the game has
a minute and I actually tried this and I

315
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:36,000
got an endless fire fight with a bear so
that just doesn't doesn't do much for

316
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,610
you so in these situations what you want
to do is identify key addresses and then

317
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,270
identified patterns in memory that can
reveal structures such as the player

318
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,600
structure or the bear structure or the
whatever structure and then identify

319
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,899
certain offsets the you might see such
as their access access position the why

320
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,730
does the you know where we're in the map
they are and then how fast they're going

321
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,650
that's what the velocity might be or the
direction they're facing there's a bunch

322
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:09,030
of things that might be contained in a
single player object such as health

323
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,350
shields invisibility and instead of
saying that I can't decrement the health

324
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:19,030
I would simply freeze that value for
that one player because if I removed the

325
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:24,889
ability to take damage it would affect
everyone everyone and I only wanted to I

326
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,030
only want to be the one that gets
unlimited home so I would freeze my my

327
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:38,020
value at a preferred amount clients I
protections will help out with us

328
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,220
tremendously so you guys saw however
very quickly and it was less than five

329
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:49,910
minutes and that was with me talking how
I did some some simple hacks if if if

330
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,730
any of this could have been obvious kid
if any of it had been perhaps encrypted

331
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,700
or just a simple check to see hey is
this is somebody debugging this there's

332
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,230
a there's a Windows API call you can
make says is debugger present if it is

333
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,490
trashed clients and cheap reports
whatever the game doesn't does doesn't

334
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,070
do that

335
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:15,710
in this can be our discussion can be
applied to all parts of the game or just

336
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,510
portions of it that are critical and
it's it's sometimes there's some

337
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,690
encryption that's applied to certain
portions but sometimes it's the entire

338
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,210
binary and win the game loads than the
binary is decrypted at runtime so that

339
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,250
makes run earth is me

340
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,270
analysis based off an image that stored
on disk very difficult so often times

341
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,080
people have to load the game

342
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,540
take a memory snapshot and then perform
analysis on that but if you're

343
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,450
encrypting portions of the game and then
decrypting and when you need to use them

344
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,890
and then re- encrypting them then that
makes that sort of analysis even more

345
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,510
difficult so there's a lot of the sort
of techniques people can use and to the

346
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,370
bugging like I mentioned enabled
sometimes people wanna can allow the

347
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:05,570
game to continue I've heard of this
heard a talk by one gentleman who said

348
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:12,100
they identified who's making the game
trainers and then they'll say okay so

349
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,360
that persons making a game changer and
then they're releasing it and other

350
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,959
people are downloading the trainer and
using it to hack the man all the people

351
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,960
that use the trainers but not the
developer then they keep identifying her

352
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,080
that she'd just been all those accounts
developers and it's not me I'm not

353
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,379
getting hacked I don't know what's wrong
with you guys

354
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,790
game that they'll do that so you won't
necessarily want to crash the executable

355
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,670
its kind how you want to play the game
with hackers and then there's one time

356
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,640
integrity checks so you saw how to
modify the code at runtime if there had

357
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,650
been something in the code to detect
that change something like fire off and

358
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,300
say hey this code is modified do you
want to reset it to what it should be or

359
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,250
do you want a flag it as cheating
something like that and then there's

360
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,430
that that's good for doing identifying
some non debugging based routines

361
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:08,130
right process memory verse wow that's
where things so then there's a

362
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,900
network-based attacks so let's say you
protected your game client you've done a

363
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,590
great job at that fantastic I'm gonna
come in here and I'm going to

364
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:22,639
approximate cam not going to touch the
claim that's easy if this goes back to

365
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,550
what we were saying earlier about if the
if the network is plain tax and all the

366
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,639
traffic is plain text doesn't matter if
your client is super protected I can

367
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,800
just also find data and send it or you
can you can modify the server traffic

368
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,860
let's say for whatever reason I'm able
to take apart a certain portion of the

369
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,350
game client that has to do it like the
game's description and encryption

370
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:54,240
mechanisms for the traffic network
traffic I might be able to figure out

371
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,250
how to do some sort of attacks that way
which is why it's good to obfuscate

372
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:08,710
clients and these sort of things can be
used to like you mentioned mention which

373
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:16,420
moms are our enemies are on a map or
sometimes you can you can identify ok

374
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,230
there's fifty different enemies on the
map and sometimes you you call it

375
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:25,780
raining in the old try and kill all the
little enemies on the map in order to

376
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,830
look for the one that has the super
awesome item that you're you're looking

377
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,110
for but if you have a network

378
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,760
client and server where the server sends
you all the data in advance and you are

379
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,200
ready

380
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,610
technically your client knows which the
enemy's has this the awesome item if you

381
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:50,199
choose Modify you make you know proxying
tool that can identify that in a pointed

382
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,700
out see i've seen seen this on you know
friend of mine had the game client and

383
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,480
then a second monitor with the map
viewer and it said ok that's where this

384
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,380
special item is an overkill that one
enemy took the Super item and then was

385
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,440
on his way and it was really simple and
it's because the client gets all the

386
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:16,190
information needed just didn't show it
is not visible in there is teleport hack

387
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,190
said you say hey I'm actually over there

388
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,330
hundred miles that way I know I was
right

389
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,418
her miles back here a minute ago
actually a second ago but I'm I'm there

390
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,969
now and the service say okay cool you're
there now so you just teleport over

391
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:40,689
there now it's real simple sometimes a
bit involved so then if you want to go

392
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:47,480
there super extreme method you can just
exploit the server if you found a way to

393
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,639
identify a vulnerability in the server
itself you get remote code execution

394
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:59,000
take over this area has a bit more in
depth and and it certainly is an attack

395
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,420
that certain attackers will pursue
because if you because of all the

396
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,130
business risks that we mentioned earlier
sometimes cheating is an attacker's main

397
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,940
goal sometimes its denial of service to
cause the company to go down for a

398
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,900
certain number of days which causes
profit loss which causes

399
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,160
that sort of stuff attacker might be
financially backed by some other party

400
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,529
that wants to see that company hurt so
do that something like a remote

401
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,960
targeting logic vulnerabilities or
implementation abilities flies and bugs

402
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,420
so their service I protections you can
do to combat some of these things so

403
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,020
only sending data that the client needs
to know this has happened is well with

404
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:56,380
map information sometimes you can send
the data about enemies if your your

405
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,970
farming or you're grinding you need to
find out which enemy has the special

406
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:07,339
item well if you only know about the
enemies once you like what they have

407
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:12,609
inside of them once you kill them were
done whenever you're supposed to do at

408
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:18,210
that moment that's good that's going to
reduce that sort of sniping sort of

409
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,880
approach of just killing the one enemy
that you mean to kill you also need to

410
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,339
consider consider all data from a client
is potentially malicious this is the

411
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:35,410
case with any client server interaction
don't matter of video games or whatever

412
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:42,160
and website anything and so you want to
take that in a careful consideration in

413
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,319
your architecture you want to compare
data received from the client to an

414
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:51,029
acceptable range of expected data so
like I was saying with teleportation or

415
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:56,180
saying that I have none I have a premium
item and trying to use a premium I know

416
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,930
when I actually don't have it making
sure that that's an acceptable range of

417
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,799
possibilities and if that causes too
much of a performance hit you can just a

418
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,450
random sampling

419
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,000
that's not gonna catch everything but it
might catch repeat offenders and and

420
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,110
that's sometimes better than nothing

421
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:22,570
so stepping back from video games
specifically there is this applies to a

422
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,940
lot of a lot of industries that are
interested in similar security concepts

423
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,760
lot of fun a lot of overlap in fact with
media and entertainment industries so

424
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,630
let's say financial institutions
financial institutions the same

425
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,050
principles apply to banking websites for
stock trading applications or ATM

426
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:46,930
transactions these these sort of things
can be applied these same attacks can be

427
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,770
applied so for ATM transactions who's to
say that I don't just split that cable

428
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,400
Ethernet cable into the router to say I
don't just like set up some sort of

429
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,450
device on that game or or or split it
and then reconnected to my device and

430
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:08,839
then I'm I'm intercepting everything if
there is no secure transfer of data then

431
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,660
the attacker discord similar with stock
trading her banquets and whatever

432
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,190
similar also with me and entertainment
is imagine video streaming restriction

433
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:25,660
by passive DRM is not enforced then
people can get what you're offering your

434
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,279
streaming services for free

435
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,900
copyright protection of physical media
the list goes on these are just a few

436
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:38,910
examples as as to where these types of
attacks can also play outside of the

437
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,500
video game industry

438
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:48,170
conclusion security is not just about
preventing cheating it also varies by

439
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:53,860
businesses and tech business type and
technical risks by genre platform center

440
00:38:53,860 --> 00:39:00,370
so the risks are unique to the industry
and some are so there's crossover layer

441
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,990
defenses are very very important because
if I can find a weakness in any layer

442
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,029
that i won

443
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,430
and like we were saying earlier both
attack and defence processes apply to

444
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,940
more than just the video game industry
so are there any questions

445
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,090
got one in the back

446
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,680
so in addition to some of the text you
described for the company thirty game

447
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,470
company to detect cheating have you ever
talk to any of them about participating

448
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:50,720
in Browning's yeah that's definitely one
approached a lot of companies take it

449
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,180
can be effective to a certain degree it
just depends on what the company's goal

450
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,740
is but batteries can can certainly find
a lot of the more low hanging fruit if

451
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,479
you have a few skilled attackers in the
audience that really understanding game

452
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,270
we've we've seen it where participants
will actually understand the game a bit

453
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,430
more than two developers themselves and
that's great to get an outside

454
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:21,000
outsider's perspective on the game I'm
also notice with bug bounties in

455
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,200
particular the community around it seems
to respect the company a bit more when

456
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,810
they say hey we're we're trying to
secure our product help us help you and

457
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:37,230
so that that generally increases the
company's reputation amongst their their

458
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,530
their clients there there people that
are buying their services and games so

459
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:47,960
yeah it's it's usually pretty beneficial
yeah

460
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,980
receptive to actually patching security
flaws as opposed to regular software in

461
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,300
banking organizations that's going to
vary by company as well right now I know

462
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,290
I know blizzard and Ryan and those big
names they will they care about security

463
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,720
but most companies actually don't care
about it just depends on how much money

464
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,890
I reckon you have the you have the
ability have the it it always comes down

465
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,020
to a business decision is their business
justification for fixing the security

466
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,030
risks because there if there is enough
I'm gonna spend ten million dollars and

467
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,180
fixing a risk that's gonna get gonna
lose me only $500,000 why am I gonna do

468
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:35,399
that yes sometimes it's an accepted risk
so yeah it's it really depends on the

469
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,230
company

470
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,730
it really depends on their income stream
in their upper management kind of

471
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,450
understanding or not understanding what
their money management prioritization of

472
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:53,598
risk so yeah you know very questions
looks like we have about a minute left

473
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:05,760
so don't know if I'm able to say but if
we if you come talk to me afterward I'd

474
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,069
be happy to share is really funny got me
started on it

475
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:13,960
any other questions

476
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,610
yes

477
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:27,890
cheat engine illegal now I specifically
picked this game cheat engine is a tool

478
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,400
it's a tool to do reverse engineering
lot of memory modification reading

479
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,440
writing scanning tool is not illegal
what I did is also not illegal it is a

480
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,520
game designed to be hacked it was part
of a capture the flag game instead of

481
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,660
just having a vulnerable website they
decided let's make a Palermo game so I

482
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,259
was demonstrating but if you're going
around and hacking without a company's

483
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,890
permission yet I guess that could be
considered illegal it or just a break

484
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:11,029
breach of the UN just kind of depends
I'm not a lawyer questions thank you so

485
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,070
much
