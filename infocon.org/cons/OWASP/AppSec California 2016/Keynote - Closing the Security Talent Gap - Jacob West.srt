1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,259
thank you guys for being here and for
giving up the happy hour on the beach

2
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:31,550
particularly is a really tough draw I'm
not surprised as anyone up here my

3
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,730
background already had its been a long
time at fortify software working on

4
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,328
static analysis but that has nothing to
do with what I do now the interesting

5
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,720
thing for me honestly in my current role
in that sweet is being at a consumer of

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,480
security technology right I've spent my
entire career building security products

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,370
and to some extent I do for NetSuite now
but also a much closer to a much more

8
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,578
aware of the challenges a particular
company a single company has in securing

9
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,679
itself then I was working at a vendor
previously and one of the biggest

10
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:09,899
challenges that companies trying to
protect themselves faces faced today is

11
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:14,810
the talent shortage finding enough
people with security skills either for

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,220
dedicated roles or to fill roles like
development or testing our operations

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,360
that have security aspects to them
finding enough of the right people with

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,290
the right skills to fill those positions
and then retaining them because it's

15
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,100
such a competitive market that once you
find the right people often they're

16
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,729
moving on to the next position very
quickly and so what I want to talk about

17
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:38,469
today is a little bit of where I think
the the state of security and software

18
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:43,490
security in particular is today some of
the factors that compounded the talent

19
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,439
shortage in the talent problem that we
face and then I'll spend most of the

20
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,130
talk talking about seven different areas
that I think seven different actions we

21
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,570
can all take to help address the talent
gap and those will range from very

22
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,398
strategic activities like really
retrofitting what it means to get a

23
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,700
computer science degree in how we think
about instructing the next generation of

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,940
computer scientists all the way down to
very very tactical activities like

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,850
running a dedicated security internship
program or highlighting security in

26
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,440
marketing and contracts with partners
and other external communication so

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,940
first off where are we today you know
Marc Andreessen said it well I think

28
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,840
when he said software is eating the
world we have software doing more things

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,840
for us in more places being written by
more people

30
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,170
and therefore carrying more importance
in our lives in our society and in our

31
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,369
economy than ever before and at the same
time or really as a result of we see

32
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,750
more and more breaches targeting that
software lair right the vast majority of

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,220
breaches I'm preaching to the choir here
at all obviously the vast majority of

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,040
breaches target those applications and
we're just writing more and more of that

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,190
bad software every year that goes by
there some challenges I think or factors

36
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,049
that really complicate this 44 companies
today for organizations today the first

37
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:12,900
is the way we deploy deliver and consume
software services increasingly software

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,459
is deployed in a public data center or a
cloud environment that is very much less

39
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,650
under our control than it was ten or
twenty years ago maybe it's under our

40
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,950
control at all maybe we have some
visibility into it but probably very

41
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,940
little and we're interacting with users
on a much more diverse set of devices

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,280
they're connecting over laptops and
mobile devices probably ones that our

43
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,290
company doesn't own or doesn't have
software on and then they're

44
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,739
communicating between that device and
that back into a network that we

45
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,430
probably have little insight or control
over wifi the local Starbucks so this

46
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,859
change in the way we consume I T is
expanding the attack surface for

47
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,780
software and making it harder for the
good guys to interfere with attacks on

48
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,900
the way they used to the next is market
economics and we've seen adversaries get

49
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,959
better and better

50
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,620
organizing around underground market
place and monetizing the intelligence of

51
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,349
the generated the skills that they have
and as with any market that has led

52
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,399
different adversaries to specialize in
different aspects of breaches and as we

53
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,659
see again in any market specialization
leads to increased capability so we see

54
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:30,979
the bar on effectiveness of attackers
rising slowly over time and we see

55
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,590
increasingly and ability to compose
different aspects of a breach from

56
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,000
different actors to mount one large
campaign that's hard to to to fight

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,009
against again because of that increased
capability and then finally we have

58
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:50,770
of regulation and compliance and and
these external constraints placed on us

59
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,990
sometimes are very powerful right
they've done a lot to increase awareness

60
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,879
around security and they've helped
companies that might not know where to

61
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,699
start

62
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,479
define what a good lower bar for
security in their organization looks

63
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,990
like the challenges I think two-fold one
compliance and regulation trains us to

64
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,050
strive

65
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,439
the executive level trains us to strive
for that lower bar they say this is how

66
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,819
good you need to be in a few people ever
asked will do I need to actually be

67
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:25,039
better in order to be secure and second
it normalizes the industry so more and

68
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,029
more companies look the same in terms of
the lower bar that their meeting and I

69
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,860
think that makes it on average easier
for adversaries to attack us as an

70
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,209
industry because we look more and more
like one another so what does the

71
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:45,439
combination of all this generation and
adoption of software along with these

72
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,740
challenges that makes securing those
software systems harder but where does

73
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,849
that leave us I think it leaves us in a
really unbalanced battle where the

74
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:58,930
adversary only has to be right ones
right they can try to compromise us a

75
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,389
thousand or ten thousand four hundred
thousand times and if they get through

76
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,740
one time they win conversely we have to
be right every single time if we fail

77
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:16,259
even ones that we've lost so while we're
in this unbalanced struggle we're

78
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,209
missing almost half of our our troops if
we want to use the battle analogy

79
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:27,449
Hanuman and HP security did research in
2014 that showed that roughly 40% of

80
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,870
security positions in the us- were
vacant throughout the year not filled by

81
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,139
the wrong person or someone with
insufficient skills but completely

82
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,199
vacant and when they looked at senior
management and senior individual

83
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,849
contributor rolls to the folks that are
having the most influence on a given

84
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:48,259
program the vacancy rate was even higher
was 49% almost fifty so we're in this

85
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,249
unbalanced battle we have to be right
every time and we're missing half almost

86
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:55,249
half of the people that are supposed to
help us win

87
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:04,110
well maybe that's ok security is a very
tiny portion of any given I T

88
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,219
organization or software organization in
fact most of the security relevant

89
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,580
decisions that are made on a daily basis
are made by people who don't have

90
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,599
security in their job title their
developers or testers our operations

91
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,498
folks we wanted to look at how
well-trained these people were how well

92
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,999
equipped they were to fill in for the
missing security people right to make

93
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:30,069
the right decision at the right time
when they were faced with it and so we

94
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,169
looked at the top 10 Computer Science
schools according to US News and World

95
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,669
Report in 2014 and picked apart their
different course curricula not caltech

96
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,799
because they don't publish theirs but we
looked at nine of the top 10 and we

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,949
categorize the courses by whether they
were focused on security or whether they

98
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,669
included security as a topic and whether
they were required courses are elective

99
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,489
courses and we found is across the nine
of the top 10 that we looked at there

100
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:04,169
was zero required courses focused on
security so that means in 2014 or early

101
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,748
2015 you graduate from any of the top
universities the United States and have

102
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:12,099
never heard more than a few lectures
that even mentioned security at any

103
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:18,058
point in your college career I would
argue even worse only three of the top

104
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:24,869
10 even had topical coverage of anything
that resembled software security so we

105
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:28,749
have to assume that whole generations of
developers are coming out of top

106
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:33,189
programs today not well equipped to
solve security problems when they're

107
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,698
faced with them and certainly not
well-equipped to go fill one of these

108
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:40,169
vacant security roles without
significant additional training and

109
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,769
education

110
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,550
the problem actually starts earlier than
college university though Raytheon did

111
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:53,609
research in 2015 looking at young adults
high school and early college age people

112
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,350
in 12 countries around the world
including the us- and what they found

113
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,910
was pretty concerning I would say a vast
majority in every region except the

114
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:09,759
Middle East sixty-two percent globally
64% in the us- had never had any

115
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,649
exposure to say

116
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,100
cybersecurity as a career opportunity
right no teacher and no guidance

117
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,639
counselor no one had ever mentioned
you're interested in technology maybe

118
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,420
you want to go into cyber security and
so if there was a burgeoning interest

119
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,459
rates and fledgling in interest in the
field there was nothing done to

120
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:31,508
encourage it there was no kind of shove
in the right direction even without that

121
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:36,459
encouragement I'm sorry I'm getting a
slight ahead let me cover one more thing

122
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:42,410
here and because of that only 31% of the
folks they surveyed were seemingly well

123
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,939
equipped to enter a field inside a enter
a role in cybersecurity upon leaving the

124
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,339
school primary secondary that they were
in when I was starting to say before it

125
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,819
is even with that lack of encouragement
even without that pushed towards

126
00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:00,699
cybersecurity we still see that 38
percent of youths surveyed in these

127
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,889
twelve countries wanted access to more
training wanted more info information

128
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,199
about cybersecurity roles so they could
determine if they would be well suited

129
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:13,300
to them so even without doing really
anything to encourage people down this

130
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,628
path we still see more than a third
looking for it on their own so where do

131
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:24,850
we stand now security fundamentally in
the last fifteen years has become

132
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:31,379
everyone's problem right when I started
off at 425 people frequently would argue

133
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,550
that security wasn't part of development
right that's not the software folks

134
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,019
responsibility that's something that
will fix afterwards by testing or by

135
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,249
countermeasures like firewalls and
antivirus today everybody accepts that

136
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:47,160
security is part of development and we
can't find enough people to to do the

137
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,800
work

138
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,899
just a couple more stats in 2014 there
were 50,000 jobs posted that required a

139
00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:00,490
CISSP certification that's roughly 75%
of all the CISSP credentials that exist

140
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,410
in the world so clearly those people are
not all unemployed and gonna fill these

141
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,009
other positions just last year as well

142
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,309
209,000 open positions across the USA
and cybersecurity and approaching a

143
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:18,879
million according to Cisco worldwide
Frost and Sullivan recently did research

144
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,950
that shows that they think the shortfall
in open on fillable position

145
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,380
in the private sector's going to reach
one and a half million by 2020 the

146
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,450
growth in this number of the 209,000 us'
positions that are open is three and a

147
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,470
half times faster than the growth in
other I T positions so the need for

148
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,460
security professionals as radically
outstripping the need for every other

149
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,920
kind of professional in our field all of
this is compounded by a huge diversity

150
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,420
problem as well

151
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,339
less than or approximately 10% of
security professionals today are women

152
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,560
and that number is that percentage is
down 1 percent from two years ago so

153
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,959
we're trending in the wrong direction
that compares with 28% across I T as a

154
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,130
whole so the numbers are a little skewed
across the field but insecurity that

155
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,540
much worse and they're headed in the
wrong direction

156
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,560
numbers are similar for minorities as
well so I think one of the big

157
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,869
opportunities is to reach out to
under-represented populations and try to

158
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,860
bring more of them into the field we'll
talk more about that so next slide is

159
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,490
the seven things I think we can all do
to solve this problem but before that I

160
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,940
just want to qualify as I mentioned
these solutions range from very

161
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,940
strategic and high-level they're gonna
take longer than our lifetimes in some

162
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,910
cases to fully realize like
fundamentally changing what a computer

163
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,910
science degree looks like but some of
them are very tactical and across the

164
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,089
board I think they are likely to involve
three major stakeholders I don't think

165
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,200
we can make much progress without
including all three of these we've got

166
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,640
to interface with the academic world
right this is where we all learned a lot

167
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,590
of us learn computer science and
computer science and programming or a

168
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,740
big piece of security today government
has a vested interest in this they need

169
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,780
to hire a lot of security professionals
but they also influenced curriculum and

170
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,819
motivate how people talk about job
opportunities in the country and then

171
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
finally obviously the industry has a
vested interest in this because we need

172
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,280
to hire these people right we can't
continue to succeed as businesses

173
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,290
without being able to meet RIT security
needs and without having the right staff

174
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:31,870
in in our companies were not going to be
able to do that so these are the seven I

175
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,650
want summarize them now I'm just going
to dive right in the start from the most

176
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,819
strategic which

177
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:40,128
alluded to a couple of times now and
this is we really have to fix what a

178
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:45,410
computer science degree means we have
for a long time taught computer sciences

179
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,819
the wrong way to write code we've taught
them databases and networking and

180
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:53,889
operating systems in an insecure way and
then we expected them to get out into

181
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,889
the real world and learn the right way
to cook those things

182
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,089
text books today are riddled with
examples of at the very least nine

183
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,970
robust code and in many cases lately
insecure code and of course no one ever

184
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,699
uses a little snippet of code they found
in a text book some wear and use it as

185
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,289
the basis for something new

186
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:17,649
unheard-of so gotta fix the text books
I've gotta fix the course materials that

187
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,309
professors used to instruct but we also
have to help think about the professors

188
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:27,429
skill set right most people teaching
computer science today learned how to do

189
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,259
things before all of the concepts around
secure coding that we've developed in

190
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,419
the last ten to twenty years had even
been thought of and so it's not enough

191
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:39,600
to fix the text books we also have to
re-educate and in some cases may be

192
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,149
encouraged turnover amongst professors
so that we get folks that really have

193
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:48,109
the skills inherently and then what I
believe is the third leg of the academic

194
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:52,629
schools so we fix the materials in the
textbooks we reeducate some of the

195
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:56,299
professors and get this incorporated
into the subjects they teach the third

196
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:00,999
leg of the stool is verification we have
to have some mechanism for when students

197
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:05,739
write bad code as part of a university
course to give them feedback on that and

198
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,759
that might be automated it might be
using things like static analysis in

199
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,009
some cases but in many cases it's a
process question writes about having

200
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,839
grad students that have the right
knowledge to be able to give feedback on

201
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,039
secure coding for submission in a class
that might not be specifically about

202
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,239
security just call a little more
attention to this gap I think if the

203
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:30,919
academic level I want to compare
computer science and other technical

204
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,239
field medicine becoming a doctor takes
on average ten to twelve years people

205
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,049
spend typically four years in
undergraduate program another two years

206
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:44,159
of course work into being a medical
school and then for 26 years of hands-on

207
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,289
hands-on increasingly practical
experience with people that are trained

208
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,030
and expert in

209
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,319
field at the end of this most of those
people know the field pretty well right

210
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,430
to become specialists in a given area
and they've actually practice with

211
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,750
patients for a long time

212
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,660
compare that to becoming a programmer
right you might do a four year degree or

213
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,490
maybe not

214
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,280
there's certainly no requirement to do
so we've looked at the kind of security

215
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,819
education you're gonna get as part of
one of those four-year degrees even at

216
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,870
the top universities in the country and
then you go into the workforce right and

217
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,760
then you're expected to know everything
you need to know to become a productive

218
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,740
programmer I can't tell you how many
companies have told me the first few

219
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,090
years they spend with someone fresh out
of undergrad spent finishing their

220
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,510
education right teaching them the rest
of what they need them to know to be a

221
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,160
programmer at their company and to some
extent that will always be the case

222
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,030
right some amount of specialization and
honing people to your company is fine

223
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,839
but shouldn't be the fundamentals of
secure coding and I think the industry

224
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,400
really has to put pressure back on the
university system to to retrofit in some

225
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,760
of the ways that I'm talking about here
one of the best ways to put that

226
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,150
pressure is to do what my friend Joe
Garza back who ran soccer shirts for DHS

227
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,130
until recently

228
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:07,130
likes to say likes to call pushing the
demand but the industry and

229
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,770
organizations in general need to do
better at being specific about what

230
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,119
security skills they need in their new
hires they need in their partnerships

231
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,939
they need in every aspect of their
business they need to promote with their

232
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,870
customers for example so signifying that
security is a priority for a company in

233
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,520
doing so in your internal and external
communication is a great way to bring

234
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,940
more people into the field and to really
highlight to key stakeholders how

235
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,130
important security is I mentioned
running a dedicated security internship

236
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,070
program this is a great way to tap into
some of those folks who haven't had

237
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,620
enough exposure exposure or access to
security knowledge but have an inkling

238
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,649
that they might be interested right you
can get them

239
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,130
inexpensively and get them while they're
still valuable preferably as part of an

240
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,540
undergraduate program and you can not
only help teach them more of what they

241
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,350
need to become effective security
professionals for the industry which is

242
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,549
good

243
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,830
to help solve the problem for all of us
can also teach them more of what you

244
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,539
need them to know for your specific
company and then you can do everything

245
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,169
you can to bring them in as full-time
hires when they graduate and from that

246
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:16,989
perspective it can be thought of as an
inexpensive training program right you

247
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:20,610
hire someone for less than you will want
their full-time employee and you give

248
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,610
them a bootstrap them on the kinds of
knowledge they need to help you with the

249
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:31,219
problems you're solving another broader
way to press the demand button in hiring

250
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,950
is to make sure that every job
description your company publishes

251
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,909
mentions the security relevant aspects
of that role obviously if you're hiring

252
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:43,720
somebody for the app SEC team there's
gonna be a lot of security in the job

253
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,749
description but what about your entry
level development job descriptions do

254
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:52,320
they talk about security at all they
talk about a preference for a background

255
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,109
in secure coding or some experience and
secure coding of familiarity in common

256
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:01,470
mistakes I think the reality is most
companies today do not and the

257
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,179
universities are paying attention to
this right they watch that signal or

258
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,759
lack of signal coming from the industry
and they say we're gonna keep putting

259
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,359
our emphasis on our priorities elsewhere
because we don't see that that's

260
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,668
something that companies are demanding I
think that's starting to change but I

261
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,249
also think it's something that we can
each have a big impact on almost

262
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:25,639
immediately by emphasizing those skills
in the job descriptions external

263
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:30,109
communication aside from hiring is an
important place to prioritize security

264
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,949
as well so in the way we talk to our
customers in marketing and direct

265
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,840
customer communication we should
highlight security because it will make

266
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,189
it clear to them that security is a
priority for us and it will call more

267
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,139
attention to the importance of the field
in contracts and partner relationships I

268
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:50,709
think this can be much more concrete
right in many cases by using the

269
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,950
appropriate security language in a
contract you can offset some of your own

270
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,139
liability and responsibility for let's
say your outsourcing software verifying

271
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:04,758
the security of that software and then
maintaining it moving forward making

272
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,779
these contracts stronger will actually
help reduce the need for internal

273
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,059
security talent at your company because
you've off-loaded some of that

274
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,480
responsibility to whomever you signed
the contract with

275
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,980
this applies to M&A activities as well I
think security is infrequently as

276
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,620
significant a topic in M&A and technical
due diligence as it should be but the

277
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,889
more attention is placed on it there the
more again we prioritize the field and

278
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,960
we communicate to the the company that
were potentially doing business with

279
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,220
that this is important and all the
people were talking to their should

280
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:45,020
understand the next area wanna talk
about is promoting security and I use

281
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,600
the word promote sort of in a double
entendre since we need to emphasize to

282
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,610
our staff the security is important and
we also need to help put more security

283
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,360
into our staff and so it's about
training and it's about job

284
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,889
opportunities and recognition on the
training side I'd like to use an example

285
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,360
from my friend Brad Arkin Adobe's who
built a really wonderful game ified

286
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,909
training system based on felt like you
would find in martial arts right like a

287
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,630
white belt yellow belt so the more
security training you get Adobe the

288
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,280
higher-ranking belt you get and that's
wonderful because it's it's game a fight

289
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,600
in computer science we love game so
that's fun right I've got a higher rank

290
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,530
than my body is and it encourages people
to go through optional training but the

291
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,760
the compliment to that and really I
think the thing that makes it a winning

292
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,560
project is a project management system
that based on the nature of the project

293
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,050
being developed kind of revenue is going
to produce timeframe etcetera demands

294
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,970
certain belts be present on the team
producing it so if you're building

295
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,600
something that's going to build you know
I'm just gonna put some numbers out of

296
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,649
the air ten million dollars in revenue
and we're gonna work on it for 18 months

297
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,010
then you need at least two brown belt
and a green belt on your project product

298
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,280
team project team that not only means
you've got the right staffing on the

299
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,740
team which is a good idea the right
skill set it also means people with

300
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,880
those belts are now more sought after
and see more opportunities within the

301
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,650
company

302
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,460
see more reward other than quitting and
taking a job somewhere else that pays

303
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,800
better in receiving the additional
training in making the investment in

304
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,310
their own skills and so I think that
complement of you know highlighting the

305
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,050
training but then rewarding it very
quantifiable II with clear opportunities

306
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,919
in the company has

307
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:35,750
done great things there another example
give is about tying security to

308
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:42,520
compensation into variable compensation
bonuses in particular one of the top 10

309
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,620
banks in the world that we did business
with early in the days of fortify was

310
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,590
really drink the kool-aid on using
static analysis within the development

311
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,250
organization one developers to do a lot
of the work but they weren't sure how

312
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,670
they would sort of change the paradigm
within development and help people

313
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,030
understand that now security was a core
of responsibility for them what they did

314
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:10,840
is tied those developers annual bonus to
their participation in the secure coding

315
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,620
initiative which meant that they need to
run these scans and fix these kinds of

316
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,030
vulnerabilities and then tell us how it
all went in the end and as long as

317
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,290
people went along with that process then
they got paid extra at the end of the

318
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,649
year and if they didn't they didn't and
the win wasn't that we incentivize

319
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,660
people with you know a 10% variable pay
at the end of the year it was that the

320
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,360
fact that the company associated pay
with this new effort made something

321
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,129
click in the developers heads right it
wasn't that oh I'm gonna lose my $10,000

322
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,900
it's this must really be important for
the company wouldn't have a line these

323
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,230
two things right my annual bonus win
depend on this if it weren't a top

324
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,370
priority and then I believe that they
got a lot more adoption lot more quick

325
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,629
acceptance of the new paradigm than they
would have without this because it

326
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:04,010
really put their money where their mouth
was just having a chat before the talk

327
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,780
here and I mentioned that I think this
is the one that has paid off the most

328
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,649
for me personally my own career and this
is partnering with academic institutions

329
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,250
whether it's a particular professor or a
whole university or maybe just hiring

330
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,010
some grad students part-time not only is
academia the source of some of the

331
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,930
problem right we we haven't retrofitted
the curricula in a way that we need to

332
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:33,150
there also a big part of the solution
and so the more we industry can do to

333
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,580
share knowledge about the way systems in
the real world are built the kinds of

334
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,740
problems they're facing the kinds of
skills we need

335
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,559
to have more in more detail than we can
communicate through a job description

336
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,620
then the better the universities are
going to be able to meet those demands

337
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:57,158
vendors like my former employer HP and
IBM and others give a lot of tools away

338
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,509
to universities and this is a great
great thing right part of being a

339
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:04,549
security professional today's probably
using some tools at some point but I

340
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:07,830
think much more valuable is that
knowledge sharing and that willingness

341
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,289
to partner with them some of the cases
where this is paid off the most for me

342
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,500
in the past have been problems in my
organization that I couldn't necessarily

343
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,850
allocate enough for the right resources
to but that were interesting problems

344
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,389
and so by partnering with an academic
organization I was able to share some

345
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:30,519
real-world details as they were missing
about the problem and get real problem

346
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,970
solving from them in return and so I
think the short-term an obvious win here

347
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,149
is knowledge sharing back to academia
the tactical win for you though is

348
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:46,428
bigger recruiting pipeline right those
people that you are working with in

349
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:50,190
their student roles are more likely to
want to come work for you and more

350
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,980
likely to understand your problem space
if you've been working with them before

351
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,659
they graduated I think it's really
important not to just focus on the top

352
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:04,259
universities here you know it's easy to
think ok if I'm not in San Francisco or

353
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,549
Boston or Chicago you know maybe I
shouldn't bother because there isn't a

354
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:12,139
big research university right around the
corner from me but couldn't be further

355
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:15,590
from the truth I think some of the
schools that are doing the best work

356
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,908
around really educating developers
around the skills they need to do this

357
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:25,440
stuff well are the smaller schools more
technical schools community colleges in

358
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,860
some cases and so certainly if you have
the opportunity to work with a top

359
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,330
research university do so and look for
the right kinds of projects to take to

360
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,210
them but also look at integrating with
the academic world at lower levels in

361
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,940
the hierarchy as well

362
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,129
smaller schools schools that are more
focused on areas that you're interested

363
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:48,199
in and you know treat this as a network
of recruiting opportunities for

364
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
different kinds of people with different
skills

365
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:59,490
so I mentioned the diversity problem up
front and I think again that's its

366
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,870
problem in and of itself but it's also
an opportunity if we need to feel more

367
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,679
roles and we see that there are groups
of people that are poorly represented

368
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,040
how can we bring more of those people in
some programs that I think you're doing

369
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,610
a good job at this there are others but
I'll highlight a few scholarship for

370
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,699
women setting information security has
been around for years been giving one to

371
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,500
two small grants for women in the last
two years of an undergraduate program

372
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,810
with the first two years of graduate
programs that information security HP

373
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:34,480
has put another quarter of a million
dollars to that and is now allowing them

374
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,980
to fund I don't know how many students
but significantly more students every

375
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,820
year and the cool thing about this is
there is no explicit demand that those

376
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,899
people then go work for HP or go work
for the government but there is

377
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,690
certainly that opportunity and I think
if more companies put small amounts of

378
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,350
capital into scholarship programs and
other things like this to really

379
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,949
encourage preferably under-represented
groups to get into the field it will not

380
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,730
only be good PR for those companies but
also be good

381
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,430
quantifiable in terms of bringing more
candidates in the field and to their

382
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:15,240
companies in particular the cyber combat
Academy from the Wounded Warrior Project

383
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,640
is another good example if you're
probably familiar with Warrior Project

384
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,830
the idea of helping former service
members who come back

385
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,980
integrate into gain the skills to to
integrate into private sector jobs cyber

386
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,920
combat Academy is obviously focused on
cybersecurity in particular and I

387
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,110
haven't worked with individuals coming
out of this program personally but I've

388
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,919
worked with several former service
members current service members and

389
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,690
folks who came in the intelligence field
and my personal opinion is this is a

390
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,840
great place to look for people in
security because many of them have

391
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,830
already been trained quite a bit on the
adversarial mind set on the way we think

392
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,980
about braking systems in insecurity and
I think it's a great starting point not

393
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,160
to mention that lots of people coming in
the military today have very deep

394
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,350
technical skills as well and so they've
got the right foundation to move into

395
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,270
these rules

396
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,889
the last project to talk about is called
year up and it has a like the Wounded

397
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,920
Warrior Project has an aspect that is
focused on security but the program

398
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:22,810
itself is broader than that europe works
with urban inner city youth to place

399
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:28,210
them in educate them for and then place
them in technical internships and some

400
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,480
of those are focused on security today
and I think that's a great area of

401
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,190
opportunity for expansion I don't think
they're doing enough of that now but a

402
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,970
few years ago I completed participated
in a workshop that was put on by George

403
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,520
Washington University hosted by
professor Matt Bishop from UC Davis

404
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,440
you're in California and we talked for
three days about how to fix the way we

405
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,040
teach computer scientist and the most
interesting and unexpected result of

406
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,920
that was if we wait until their computer
scientist computer science students

407
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,270
we've waited too long we really have to
start this education at high school

408
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,970
earlier and the biggest thing that the
group agreed on we need to focus on high

409
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,540
schools understanding the consequences
when something goes wrong right

410
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,780
understanding that if this thing isn't
built properly or isn't operated

411
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,399
properly then bad things can happen to
society and I think again year up is a

412
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,380
great example of trying to catch people
a little before they get to their

413
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,730
freshman year of college right last two
years of high school teach them some of

414
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,730
what they need to know and then set them
on the direction to learn more

415
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:40,630
these last two steps aren't really about
getting more talent there about

416
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,610
minimizing our need for talent because
the reality is we're never going to have

417
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,199
enough security professionals and even
if somehow as an industry we we solve

418
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,060
that problem and we meant enough new
security people sorry if we missed

419
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,850
enough new security people will still be
expensive because it's still going to be

420
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:04,000
a specialized role and so will always as
profitable businesses want to minimize

421
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,550
our need for highly specialized highly
expensive resources working together is

422
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,570
a great way to reduce our need for this
and i wanna talk about two forms of

423
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:19,700
collaboration one is knowledge sharing
person-to-person share experiences I'm

424
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,330
an author as you mentioned my intro of
co-author of the building security in

425
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,960
maturity model the goal of this was to
measure different organizations maturity

426
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,730
in their software security initiatives
and that that that's pretty cool and

427
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,460
your big report published every year as
a result of it but the bigger value we

428
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,580
got out of the project is the community
that formed around these firms that have

429
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,840
been measured and early on the firm
started asking for a private moderated

430
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,000
mailing list so that they could have
private communications with one another

431
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,550
within the community they asked for
community conferences so that they could

432
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:58,020
come together under Chatham House Rules
and share details about their security

433
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,690
initiative what worked what didn't

434
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,210
best practices and so on and although
the the geek in me finds the data

435
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,420
crunching in the maturity measurements
really interesting this community of

436
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,960
like-minded folks supporting one another
i think has been a much bigger impact on

437
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,230
the industry and so if there are
opportunities for you or your

438
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,860
organization to either consumed
community content or to share content

439
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,540
with the community I really encourage
you to do so because I think we can all

440
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,850
do much better if we work together on
some of these problems early on I don't

441
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,370
think many people would argue today but
early on there was an argument that

442
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,070
security was an important differentiator
right I'm gonna be a little more secure

443
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,939
than the other guys and therefore people
are going to come to me think

444
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,650
increasingly we've seen that that's a
red herring I think for most verticals

445
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,490
overall insecurity the perception of
insecurity and the reduction in customer

446
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,550
confidence because of that is more
damaging to every firm in the vertical

447
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,270
than it is to one that does a little bit
better than the others so I think again

448
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,270
in our best interest to collaborate
around these things and to do better as

449
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:05,900
a whole the other kind of collaboration
I want to talk about is not human to

450
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,520
human its computer to computer and it's
sharing threat intelligence information

451
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,520
about the waves were being attacked and
preferably security intelligence more

452
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,970
broadly there plenty of seats if anybody
wants to sit down I won't be offended

453
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:25,680
whatsoever the front rows totally
friendly caring not only information

454
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,200
about how are being attacked but also
how remediating that and there several

455
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,190
companies

456
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,320
startups and large organizations
developing platforms to automate this

457
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,700
kind of machine-to-machine sharing I
don't think any of them are really at a

458
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,019
point of maturity yet so I think it's
more of an exploration for companies but

459
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:48,779
I think it's a fantastic idea we see the
same attackers use the same relatively

460
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,059
commoditized attacks to attack firm
after firm after firm typically very

461
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:54,029
successfully

462
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,480
the more we can share about those
attacks the more we can get that

463
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,710
information shared in a automated way in
front of the people who haven't been

464
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,740
attacked yet the better the chance they
have of defending themselves their three

465
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,668
attributes of such a platform that I
think are critical and I think everyone

466
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:13,250
should look for if they were going to
embark in some sort of information

467
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,679
sharing effort like this the first I've
already mentioned I think it has to be

468
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,940
automated early efforts around this were
designed to let expert analysts and

469
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,569
individuals share intelligence with one
another but the reality is we don't need

470
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:31,520
more stuff to read right we don't need
more inputs to the analyst we need

471
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,389
things taken off of the analyst
shoulders and so we need to automate as

472
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,210
much of the response to this
intelligence as possible so that we're

473
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,599
not just generating new PDFs for
analysts to slog through the next is

474
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,379
closely related the intelligence that we
consume from such a platformer community

475
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:52,750
has to be relevant to us right if we're
drinking from the fire hose and ninety

476
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,149
percent of it is about vulnerabilities
in Microsoft applications and we're

477
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:02,480
running a total Linux stack it's just
not helpful to us right so the the the

478
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,319
the ability to consume relevant
information precisely is incredibly

479
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:10,329
important attribute and then finally I
think the platforms have to be open

480
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:15,380
these can't lock us into particular
vendors because that only increases the

481
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,530
need for security professionals in our
company that are familiar with that

482
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,849
particular vendors platform that
particular vendors products and what we

483
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:29,200
want is to make these roles more generic
and more easily fillable by more people

484
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
because we need to expand the people in
the field

485
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:38,130
ok the last 1 I'll talk about is
technology and I've spent 15 years

486
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,060
building security tools of course I'm
gonna talk about a chainsaw is dead

487
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,509
chainsaws my favorite tool like it
because of certain properties that it

488
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:53,110
has the first is no one buys a chainsaw
brings it home dropped off in the

489
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,620
backyard heads inside the dinner goes to
bed and expects to wake up the next

490
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,430
morning with all the trees cut down
right people understand that chain saws

491
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,089
are tools that enable people to do
something much more effectively but they

492
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:08,890
don't do the things by themselves and if
we applied the same understanding the

493
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,370
software tools more often I think we
would use them much more effectively

494
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,529
rules don't replace humans in most cases
they make them more efficient for the

495
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,550
offload certain aspects of what that
humans wasting their time

496
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:24,020
the other thing I like about the
chainsaw is people treat them with

497
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,090
respect

498
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,810
right just because I go and buy a
chainsaw doesn't mean I'm a lumberjack I

499
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:35,710
can't go you know fell forest full of
trees but likewise if a lumberjack shows

500
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,670
up to work with an axe today instead of
a chainsaw they're gonna be left off the

501
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,900
job right they're not well equipped to
do that it's an important piece of their

502
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,270
work but it doesn't do the job for them

503
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:52,440
security tools are dangerous when it
comes to staffing problems and resource

504
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,900
problems because they can actually
generate more work than they reduce

505
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,180
static analysis that I've spent most of
my life working on is a great example of

506
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,960
this

507
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,760
you deploy static analysis in the wrong
way or you expected to solve your

508
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,410
problems for you you're just going to
create a huge volume of work that you're

509
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,350
not well equipped to handle your gonna
generate a bunch of bugs for the

510
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,810
development team that are never gonna
get addressed or you're gonna worse

511
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,720
create a bunch of vulnerability details
in a database of there that somewhere

512
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,459
that no one's even going to review the
only been know that they were a bug in

513
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,610
the software because no one ever looked
at them in the first place

514
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:31,710
technology used judiciously however can
be a great boon and so my advice or and

515
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,350
using technology is to use it in precise
ways and to use it to address problems

516
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,890
not to check boxes right if your problem
is you're being attacked in a certain

517
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,160
way or you know your developers are
making certain kinds of mistakes you

518
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,009
static analysis in a targeted way to
address those don't just talk it over

519
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,910
the wall and expect everyone to start
dealing with everything that it produces

520
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,450
that's only gonna create more

521
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:59,299
work and frustrate everybody involved
probably my biggest regret in all the

522
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,540
years I spent working on fortify was the
amount of great stuff that we found that

523
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,079
no one was able every able to act on
right we found wonderful vulnerabilities

524
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,450
that never saw a human eye because they
lived in a database somewhere in didn't

525
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,439
get prioritized in the right way so
thinking about the way use technology in

526
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,890
a smart way to really reduce your need
for people and saw the actual problems

527
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:28,150
you have is really really important so
starting to wrap up a little bit what

528
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,460
are some common misconceptions around
the staffing problem the talent gap

529
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,070
technology i think is at the root of a
lot of them right either technologies

530
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:41,450
gonna solve every problem or it's not
gonna solve any problems both of those

531
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,730
are are patently false right use
technology intelligently and can

532
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:50,010
absolutely help solve the right kinds of
problems to do security you have to be a

533
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,119
professional or you have to have a
certification of some sort or you need a

534
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,730
degree in security all of this is
clearly false right look at around the

535
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,460
room

536
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,420
how many people here have degrees in
security ok like three percent maybe

537
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,359
habit certifications probably a little
higher pay 20 percent maybe like 30

538
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,990
percent probably most of the people here
do for a living CRD security

539
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,589
professionals I won't ask about that but
we want to encourage people without the

540
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:24,599
credentials without the degree to get
interested in to the field

541
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,920
interested in the field in to come into
the field and so perpetuating

542
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,000
misconceptions like you need some sort
of magic anointment in order to do the

543
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
job just damages our chances there

544
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:44,819
in that they want they want that
checkbox they want the degree they want

545
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,300
yeah so i think you know educating
within our company's educating

546
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:57,190
executives H R even development around
the real nature of the problem is the

547
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:03,300
first step there right it's not about
not about having the security team be

548
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,370
fully staffed it's about instilling
these properties in our software when

549
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:11,089
it's finished and lots of people can do
the latter even if they don't

550
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:17,960
necessarily belong on the security team
but it's a real struggle absolutely the

551
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,960
last one

552
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,210
I was warned that they won't use
microphones for questions britt do you

553
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,329
mind I've got one more slide when you
ask that again after that slide

554
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:44,809
fantastic thank you and sorry the last
one and i've seen this just in preparing

555
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:49,309
for this talk the last couple months all
over the press 0 there is an Italian

556
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:54,529
shortage it's just temporary it's just
exaggerated it's not a problem I don't

557
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:58,809
see that frankly I'm on the ground and
companies can't find the right people

558
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:03,369
come people can't fill the positions
they need to fill so I I just don't

559
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,380
believe that's true and I think there's
enough real data out there some of which

560
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:11,299
I including the talk today to disprove
that but if you hear some of these

561
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,970
misconceptions frankly they're damaging
to our efforts to solve this problem we

562
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,160
all owe it to the the I T industry to
help dispel them whenever possible

563
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,150
alright so to conclude these are all
over the board right some of them are

564
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,210
gonna take decades to execute right what
a computer science degree means I'm

565
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,270
gonna change overnight but if those of
us with access to the knowledge and

566
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:38,230
resources and frankly motivation to
solve the problem don't start to engage

567
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:45,680
it's never going to move just because we
can't solve the entire problem today or

568
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,980
just because something doesn't have an
immediate reward for me or my company

569
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,609
doesn't mean it's not worth investing in
with that said I think there were

570
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:56,680
examples throughout this list of very
tactical stuff that someone at almost

571
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,299
any level in an organization can begin
to execute and the commensurate returns

572
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:05,680
right again you're not going to solve
the whole problem for your company in

573
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,379
one day but you might start to chip away
at it one person at a time I'm gonna

574
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,029
leave it there and I know we have at
least one question from the audience

575
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:18,789
their recording this and so they want to
use microphones so raise your hand again

576
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:23,950
a microphone and asked him to that so
Jake this is based on what you said

577
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:30,629
about H R and whatnot i I do find that
some security teams ever real problem in

578
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,020
letting go of the security functions
because they're worried it won't be done

579
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:40,400
well they won't be done perfectly they
have a due diligence responsibility and

580
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,400
so are they had a fight a massive fight
just to exist in the

581
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,650
you get a real fox hole on some of the
security teams I work with has been a

582
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,720
real fox hole kind of mentality that
says you know those stupid people

583
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,089
developers out there and are smart
people are security people we know and

584
00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:01,770
you know I don't I don't know it's not
really a question

585
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:06,190
know it's it's absolutely valid and I
see it all the time I think it's

586
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,609
incredibly toxic and so I think if
that's the environment right it's it's

587
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,819
us versus them its security versus
development you have to work to correct

588
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:24,049
that culture you're never going to make
any progress I J K sorry ninety security

589
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:32,009
recruitment company and the secret a lot
of stuff you you talked about this is a

590
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:41,160
couple of Secrets hoping my business but
basically is that this is not happening

591
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,118
people aren't talking within the
business we often feel jobs open six

592
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,010
months because what they see so the
recruitment managers looking for isn't

593
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:58,420
what any of their current agencies are
looking for or isn't a job people wore

594
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,390
their internal recruitment people
looking for they're not communicating

595
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,109
and unless you end up speaking to the
right person that role just sits there

596
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,609
and get sun filled right in and you know
I promise he didn't pay me before him

597
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:12,598
but using specialized recruiting
services actually understand the

598
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,950
security field is incredibly important
in finding outside candidates because

599
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,730
your average age our department your
average recruiters get a really hard

600
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,730
time with it and then you if they were
there to be hired the problem is they

601
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,609
probably don't exist

602
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:27,900
yes lazy there is not easy job anyway to
find what you mentioned about

603
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:34,400
unrealistic requirements as well a lot
of people need to be realistic about

604
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,049
what they're looking for and if
companies build a way of training or

605
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:43,450
bringing through internships discuss
that's the way to do it

606
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,598
cyber watch west on the advisory board
for those guys

607
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,930
their state colleges and then National
Science Foundation

608
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,049
funded they're trying to bring through
people say look look at these these

609
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,309
companies that you can power up and get
the first shot some of those students

610
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:05,710
that's really going to help you that's
gonna help me provide experienced people

611
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:11,040
is not enough experience people out
there I saw this year and very early on

612
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,859
you I love you I D about sharing
intelligence but I have suddenly little

613
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:22,640
problems and questions about that as if
each time when we're loading about you

614
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,589
know

615
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:30,049
bility or other information is very
obscure mostly coming from absolutely

616
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:35,190
misleading I would say media reports and
there is an awesome security

617
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,800
professional can take them sit right on
the other hand if you are saying that

618
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,210
this should be like an open system is
all details for example for me

619
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,380
personally it would be enough to see a
request and response to understand what

620
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,359
similar abilities if you share in this
kind of information with everyone even

621
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:57,150
script changes will be able to
immediately attack everyone right so how

622
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,500
would you approach cordial issue this
kind of details something like this this

623
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,270
question of trust in both directions can
I trust you share things with and who

624
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,950
can I trust as a source of how would you
determine home to shave his i think is

625
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:14,259
the single biggest challenge in the the
whole concept of sharing intelligence

626
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,520
but if we try to automated I think the
answer is to build on existing circles

627
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,809
of trust or at least the the start of
the answer so we already have

628
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:26,440
communities that are working together
and sharing very sensitive information I

629
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,690
think of the ice axe for example and
they're building automation technology

630
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,490
as well I think you build on those
existing circles of trusting

631
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,828
relationships between organizations that
have some trust between one another and

632
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:42,079
then you were to automate those existing
channels and as you automate them

633
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,540
hopefully you find ways to expand the
circle of trust as well

634
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,980
things like reputation systems could
could play a big role here once you get

635
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,569
critical mass of adoption but I think
it's incredibly hard problem absolutely

636
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:58,770
I used to give a whole talk just on that
topic so we could talk for hours

637
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:07,250
microphone hold on sorry hold that for
once I can't so my name is brian is out

638
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,230
again from the advisory board company so
we actually have some interesting

639
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:16,380
challenges in terms of finding town
right now in the dc-area because a lot

640
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,039
of government requirements don't mention
like they're not specific enough run up

641
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:28,180
sex at like upset at all in any field
development of products or beat even

642
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,690
like security analyst or anything of the
sort so one of the tax that we're taking

643
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:37,619
released I like I will be taking Mike
mcBride was with us taking specifically

644
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:43,720
be to train up developers to get into
appt SEC from have absolutely stage

645
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,660
building on that other specific points
that you see as being just very valuable

646
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:54,598
incentives to bring people to consider
it as an appendage to development from a

647
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,079
very early stage like literally entry
level developers in terms of

648
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,650
incentivizing them getting excited about
it i mean so i think there's a large

649
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,930
percentage of people who will be great
security professionals who are

650
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,220
immediately excited better at the idea
of breaking things exciting so how do

651
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:14,078
you reach that the next level out past
those I don't know what motivates people

652
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,240
but apparently money seems to work
pretty well and so I would talk about I

653
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,578
would talk about what huge opportunities
there are in this field right i mean if

654
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:25,539
you took a summary of this talk where I
said there aren't enough of these people

655
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:29,119
have two roles are empty we can't find
enough of them and you take that to a

656
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,130
bunch of new computer scientists who are
thinking about what to specialize in a

657
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:39,029
way that sounds like a pretty good thing
to specialize in one more question

658
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:45,359
because I cut him off before and then
we'll stop I promise Texas System yeah

659
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,509
they all have a great depth when it
comes to acquiring new talent stuff like

660
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:53,460
that I've only been in this industry
brought two years and have a hard time

661
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,950
breaking in welcome bring more ok coming
up to a barrier I will break through

662
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,919
eventually but gentle aggravating

663
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:07,359
now there's a loophole kind of with with
law in California you don't actually

664
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,810
have to take the bar exam you can do an
apprenticeship has there been

665
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:17,570
an idea or is it not feasible to have an
apprenticeship the idea of an

666
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:23,550
apprenticeship within our industry so
absolutely within a given company yes in

667
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,030
every company I've ever worked for does
this because it's way easier it's way

668
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,740
easier to find your website person on
your development team than it is outside

669
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,410
your company but if not then you kind of
screwed right it's much harder to teach

670
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,540
someone who knows security computer
science that it is the other way around

671
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,850
and today such a big part of security is
understanding applications not

672
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:49,020
impossible but it's a long road oh ok
I'll give up now thank you very much I

673
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,980
really appreciate you being here
