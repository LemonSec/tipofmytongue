1
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:36,140
using those funds into fishing scenario
mortgage to gain access to 522 are

2
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,530
particularly interesting because it is
not known how do you here are some

3
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:58,450
notable ones is one person who told me
they also they utilize but once so I'm

4
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:07,090
your securities also I US business
services need also all these computers

5
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:16,310
to do so we learn in this presentation
here we're learning what exactly causes

6
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,420
internal is how does it work

7
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,800
home a run and what makes it so those
features are actually falling chance of

8
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:36,620
winning a lottery products and trade on
that occasion the sidelines of code very

9
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,000
heart really goes his vision service so
there's a couple of things close

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,220
although he has to go through hopefully
live demo vocals are so pretty and i

11
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,830
presume that

12
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:04,390
production methods you can use to
actually stop once from the outside but

13
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:14,210
what is his next Google wrapped around
his any sort of cold water on demand and

14
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,710
generally uses to deploy applications
throughout their internal network to

15
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:29,210
install the user bases in there a little
after referee and don't he says that

16
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,080
he's reduction so that's why it's
interesting to developers

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:43,910
pushes out and it also supported mobile
device installed the LED glow from the

18
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,480
scene show business to run

19
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:45,720
and so to those connections great
resource that is Google's that you're

20
00:03:45,720 --> 00:04:00,010
going to go ahead and so users system
that he's done it once and for all the

21
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:12,638
other files so they just Microsoft
products and technologies that uses

22
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:25,830
optical verify your own who signed cert
from 45

23
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:36,790
alert service sign stages are available
to sign using a sort of just be yourself

24
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,800
by making her own local search for
unsigned no sir

25
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,630
obviously the last you saw sign
alongside are actually treat the same

26
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:57,030
insurance policies so certain amount
size gonna follow the same house low for

27
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,030
launching that application

28
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,500
Wednesday software architecture based on
the different execution sources so if

29
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,830
you try to solve a patient's from global
tried to send you a little different

30
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,830
from you try to resolve from left

31
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:30,180
applications to elevated privileges I
magnin that's usually or you will and

32
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:37,040
that's the important part needs more
commission has the last user to go ahead

33
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,560
and give it control you

34
00:05:46,729 --> 00:06:01,919
concerning that wants to stop is favored
the most important areas was that the

35
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,558
end user to know all the reasons without
the help of it happen

36
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,498
makes a great tool for visiting because
any losers as long as possible for

37
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:27,210
health reasons to exceed all see ya down
so fast and then it is more commissions

38
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,628
granted by the user is out but not want
to come

39
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,330
here is the original configuration with
excessive use I wasn't able to stop it

40
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:58,979
was an easy for users to actually try
this enables only for sign applications

41
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:08,639
by a certificate for so it was looking
promising I first texted me to russian

42
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,860
they went ahead and change that to you
to decide by CA or any other occasions

43
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,229
that are coming from

44
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,109
once again and users are responsible for
all vehicles

45
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:36,199
so while so it's a part of those
criticisms because of the lies I dot net

46
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:43,889
and is that a song backwards
compatibility so if you have 1.5 blocks

47
00:07:43,889 --> 00:08:00,800
for one home run on that machine is
extremely cold yes this is not a major

48
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:09,240
thing is that correct terms of their
highly vs it and they are crafted items

49
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,970
for others the reason to do this because
they actually crashed browser the crap

50
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,370
managers on the play and that's a
breakout

51
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:26,650
so in terms of fishing choosing the
right team basement has going on I want

52
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,718
to make sure that the least amount users
were aware that there are things like

53
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,140
that are more likely to report that I T

54
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:54,930
so is also obviously a tremendous a call
he made to deploy these were the phone

55
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,399
can support multiple fires so you can't
really why so many issues stand by what

56
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:08,839
you do this file your users and that's
where he will be

57
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:16,540
minimizes user interaction again this is
one that is all it takes to run a

58
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:24,040
malicious executable and he can deliver
malicious code through multiple

59
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,329
different options

60
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:34,069
dot net projects were running called off
their box so you can show you our

61
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:46,579
insights into below so this is so in
terms of people that you can include

62
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:57,109
controller all original ended up getting
play by hosting it once again this read

63
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,519
to you wanna make sure that 80,000 jobs

64
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:10,810
know there is the standard medicine lol

65
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:25,760
the best boyfriend but you can generate
and results not sure why shells were

66
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:36,520
returning to their homes now and so is
he playing down the second stage of the

67
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:46,430
table so using that just follow that I
wrote about this

68
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,420
PowerShell executable that would include
there's obviously some clothes that our

69
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,930
show and avoids the

70
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:13,709
I have yet to be stopped but he showed
his generation of that is a little more

71
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:29,959
difficult just turned off so I this
technology is you already have a

72
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,560
presence

73
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,050
you want to see this is much possible
outcomes being played by TV but I'm

74
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,740
certain there so just have to wait

75
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:53,120
wanna go for millions of ppl framework
told by some versions and so I can do

76
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,640
that

77
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,569
pros outweigh the cons in this case
poses I was around in different

78
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:09,150
languages you got your clothes a little
mislead any kind of language and so does

79
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,810
increase of pellets 01 character
password brute force its own casper

80
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:28,310
basically decrease in this house to
avoid because it's an encrypted so they

81
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:34,150
called you this when I was originally
was that it was a static random call

82
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:46,209
myself and had to do with Venezuela how
it's how it handles so so every time I

83
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,000
come back to generate higher

84
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:04,560
generate one fire engine to send that
same identifier win this round boxes and

85
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:17,170
so this is actually a release of Staples
Center back in september or so ago bill

86
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,790
to the problem once games those lost at
home by five runs on more than one

87
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:29,079
machine I would only get 1 I'll wait to
see the same UID so you are how to spell

88
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:40,310
it out so that the solution was to
peruse our basis so every time you visit

89
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,310
the site generator and you will kill us

90
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:55,920
so I'm actually going through a lot of
worries go through in the towel

91
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:44,740
into an error I dot involved and the
great thing about this is once again

92
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,540
this is all about dad's although you
know all

93
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,060
correlates and say yes this person did
these things they click on the link they

94
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,810
watched the application gotta show that
having those metrics is extremely

95
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,810
helpful

96
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:15,569
use your standard message was listen
here you can write here or manage coal

97
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:22,719
if you want done it this was a limited
window of engagement and frankly didn't

98
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:31,059
have the time to write while demand
control infrastructure and things like

99
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:39,118
that and then just 480 vac

100
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:50,779
turning us and those user base is so so
they're more than likely to have

101
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:15,580
packages in his hand into a result out
this season was better but still does

102
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:27,070
not play nicely without all will use all
the help install why Python programs

103
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:35,860
accident pilot and his wife are the
longest part of building this this

104
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:53,590
fishing but wants is getting off work
now is extremely simple calls lately so

105
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:59,430
long to get back to signing for
dynamically generating

106
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,709
cruiser

107
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:19,530
talking mainly because I'm a nervous
filed as soon as balls from files but

108
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,310
there's no easy way to dynamically
occasion

109
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:39,629
generally page to research doesn't and
so self sensors are only marginally

110
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,900
saying overflow and so there's no sign
of her own

111
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,900
certain

112
00:17:51,800 --> 00:18:01,510
is going to be all your bases into the
crowd and they go to some of the scenes

113
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:08,660
the city directories that and so if you
want to clean the South Kirkland basis

114
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:15,680
do is going to that folder and then find
the Apple there is going to be named in

115
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:24,440
Visual Studio and just believe that the
song or those dirty animal programs

116
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:32,300
using that or he can do everything so by
running the run he allowed to move that

117
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,310
manner that will delete all of your
online applications so you wanna make

118
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,740
sure you're not using anymore

119
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:48,020
their cases before you load the bases

120
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,620
elevated privileges at an admin Jackson

121
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,620
local after

122
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm using windows and the California
person who's all coming in so this is

123
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,160
the code army can see that

124
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:51,639
and then executable this case to the
process and then start it's as simple as

125
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,420
that

126
00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:03,320
inside you and your solution explorer
who you see working great on the product

127
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:13,030
itself in the mass and then there's a
couple

128
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:35,000
entire framework for me to do is to
target Windows 8 Windows 8 Phone and

129
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,679
windows had all of the same location so
if you want her to turn things like

130
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,629
Windows 7 or below

131
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:53,939
going to go down and that's just as you
want to do that out of class template

132
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,899
they should we hire web server and take
a look at my web browser which were

133
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:10,360
divided and then decide which way to go
with the right person if I decided to

134
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:18,870
stop the racks for what your country

135
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:35,120
this is this spot you specify whether or
not to pull out kitchen is coming next

136
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:52,959
go ahead and ran the application forms
will get with you so that it won't

137
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,570
prompt the user for their mission run
because authorities in that context

138
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:19,330
last year so this has to do with the top
10 football recruiting

139
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:32,649
generally make sure to exclude the hash
reasonable that if you could please you

140
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:40,710
will recognize the house is being run by
you know all this is that if you sign

141
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:54,440
your obligations to make sure all so as
you know

142
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:06,450
generating the piles from there you want
to go ahead and your website

143
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:23,869
so it takes 20 seconds here because I
have no sales for less

144
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:34,929
there's been a long and straight down
here it also tells you what to expect

145
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:42,669
from you see that helps users who follow
and I were talking like taxes the survey

146
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:58,869
you go ahead with this number does
little to no good if you tell another

147
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:01,869
passengers

148
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,690
Daniels are using from here

149
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:49,010
so

150
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:35,869
something

151
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:57,639
so there is and how it turned out that
30 percent of users arson and she said

152
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:14,080
and also over so now it is possible that
they are you trying to say hey don't

153
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:24,230
actually sleep but more than likely not
house trained police fired that say hey

154
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:34,200
these are bad don't do this so high so
you can't necessarily true what else to

155
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,110
do

156
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:47,559
protection and a box it helps with
malicious executables but once again the

157
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:58,850
civil service for these files are police
closed lay behind Russia usage notes are

158
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:13,270
being dicks no you can't how location is
trying to access this fire was filed

159
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:21,240
against him the user's system just like
yes yes you have to have a healthy so

160
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:37,720
you're more likely to stop was the most
important as well so we can get on well

161
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:54,450
possibly execute privileges or anything
like that happens it's harder for them

162
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,730
to go ahead

163
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:06,610
slovenly ok can discourage some
attackers almost 40 hours would actually

164
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:19,428
attack so you're going to get so just
slows down so helpful but they're not

165
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:36,290
necessarily so put it on specific
techniques for his vision has Visual

166
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:46,950
Studio application you can you can go
ahead and how does responds to that

167
00:31:46,950 --> 00:32:04,570
business execution so cold virus users
and you can just see from there and get

168
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,470
a prompt is controlled by his own so

169
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:21,309
love machine that things like that so go
ahead and this direction settings so if

170
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:38,760
its naval any can go ahead and come
through unscathed by the balance before

171
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:49,600
the user will be prompted to accept and
doesn't conform to the policies get into

172
00:32:49,600 --> 00:33:05,980
the system so than usual so it's alright
so that's the best way to prevent

173
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,980
complications

174
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:21,600
can be controlled by RuPaul cease
operations and then going to eat drink

175
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,699
and be merry widows

176
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:35,919
just use simple they had to run but I'll
call recommended you disable left in the

177
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:45,669
default ok action this comes up when
you're actually going to actually did to

178
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:56,539
where you go to a more info when will
that enable individuals to clips

179
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:12,540
hurting kind of operating systems and so
is that time by its users do you see

180
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,389
this as a significant drop in the amount
of those steps when they see smarTrend

181
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:28,800
away real quick with a quip once it's
all these of access for the user and

182
00:34:31,730 --> 00:35:07,050
and anything else

183
00:35:24,870 --> 00:36:11,960
so you're buying me working with NY

184
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:19,220
now not require one seems very tired so
times vary

185
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:41,750
user in this case are you are so so so
what i'm saying all these females

186
00:36:41,750 --> 00:37:04,680
12 and so the city

187
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:31,520
value is hosting a visual studio 2008
she uses her you know so so we create

188
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:42,990
your kitchen every time she visits the
site template into their

189
00:37:52,829 --> 00:38:07,249
right exactly so most utility to third
parties

190
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:55,549
those
