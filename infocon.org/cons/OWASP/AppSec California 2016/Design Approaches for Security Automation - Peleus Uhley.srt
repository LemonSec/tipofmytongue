1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:28,159
and they don't have a different route
130 sure you guys in mind he gay I'm

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,559
gonna happen every time I area's housing
week which researchers say they've

3
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,589
really street for about 16 years
eventually seized with his originated

4
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:52,979
put it to pack a bathing suit over 50
years this is he has he talked about his

5
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,220
religious discrimination against you
going to see the presentations like if

6
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:03,199
you read a lot fewer say I see all sorts
of their presentation tomorrow and won't

7
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,189
there are very good and dairy products
but he's like how this is developing a

8
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,479
damn good talk a little about the
challenges as well get into things are

9
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,150
really good out there in serious
condition and that comes into city

10
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,060
streets around here yet another

11
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:30,430
the suspenders and getting up there so
we'll see how that makes a lot and we

12
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,789
had a long history with the point of
view I need to turn buildings with

13
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:41,549
building things to their own sake is not
a good way to build good things and it's

14
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,990
not about different types of the
nation's they wanted to go to hockey you

15
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,679
hear about these things like doing
everything its tail being very large

16
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:52,689
projects which is where did you see our
nation and that everything needs me to

17
00:01:52,689 --> 00:02:00,119
stop Iran is the price yet available to
law or regulation there's always a

18
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,600
bookkeeping good at making it a little
bit more tactical a little bit more to

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,538
your organization decides he's taking
zappa Bergen right across the clouds and

20
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:17,130
indeed very little tactical in terms of
points 3 I'm Asian initiated during a

21
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,329
large projects and then go ahead and
grab some closing thoughts in the first

22
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,850
place you want to start with you and
start with 22 why I'm glad we're going

23
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,040
this way they going to get out of it
does he think about our nation like he

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,810
doesn't pay as well that's what you're
saying is that of issues typically

25
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:45,440
vending machines automation you know
where you're going where day laborers

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,450
different houses in be better way of
doing things people do change

27
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,269
large-scale security holes in the past
three they say something like that and

28
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,069
you pull you across the entire
organization basically holding a

29
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,619
presentation right and he did everything
is straight these things before and

30
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,650
youre going by your print edition this
doesn't necessarily work and there's a

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,760
very serious very adeptly

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,939
what does work out their products but
not every 10 to go into places like a

33
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,970
contender for devices like that your
privacy

34
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,220
take a look at how is my deployment of
this will be a different from disappoint

35
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,680
the imposition of this tool I'm gonna
get something better out of it by going

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,340
to get something more meaningful to the
organization and push and yet and yet

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,689
you have made you feel any fear that
that would you want to go out of it and

38
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,700
then turned to tell you bill did you
know there's different ways of doing it

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,040
when you get into that situation box so
far grander plan and doing things bigots

40
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,629
yellow and say you know what do you
think I got to see the pool it's a happy

41
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:06,099
life mediating pathologic ABC's all good
building javascript framework chto quite

42
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:18,870
as awesome as you think it was a
disappointment and Dr Rice is the city W

43
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:26,320
S Class you can go to an infinite number
of websites since he got his idea for

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,760
about six months out who I'm talking
about unity its prob gonna go do it I

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,979
can create your head your way home from
any guide to getting within the industry

46
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:46,909
for a little bit I can be contacted
Roche remains CBH this is H you see that

47
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:59,930
you can get you max you're really old
though has scheduled its he did you get

48
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,889
into his sites that we have 12 only
takes like how do you rate up three

49
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,300
times a day and I don't give me your
speech right

50
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:21,040
society says everything is great but
when talking about politicians like at

51
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:29,170
one point he backed by my days in which
case you should contact you know what is

52
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,340
the value and doing this behind us

53
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:39,539
yeah and then the other thing that comes
out to usually people come here and

54
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,490
games that is really great yepper

55
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,390
automation and he's really good place
and there's only been part of this is so

56
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:54,070
elegant and it's time to rock sourze
gate and deliver on it you know he's

57
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:04,570
here and he's saying this period over
here in five years ago after all built

58
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:10,219
these things great because yes he is Rex
energy to whether they promised rock

59
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,840
says he and other projects which have
fires considering taking off and then

60
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,859
you will see me into playing hard
playing because she's going to a doctor

61
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,600
and nurse immediately party
organizations have a hard time going

62
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:35,640
through your head to the AT&T the
process and we're still believes you

63
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,349
have nothing to be like this is a good
idea bad stuff in the things that you

64
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:50,270
want to go what GATT lawyer things and
get back to why they do I really

65
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:56,530
important because they were more

66
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,070
or whatever and you can go on a crisis
thousand sites and said we're addressing

67
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,580
thousands of this decade reports what
happens the SEC reports after they

68
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,550
neglect them all right if you're going
to see that mission project he had no

69
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,880
idea we review the deal and it's a very
tender process it comes out yeah you're

70
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,550
going to need to be done to do business
with this is your organization forward

71
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,430
right to hit you btw prepared to process
it seems like they have all the

72
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,810
information and may not actually able to
give something back line this long

73
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,550
action and there's always have to be
gaining reviewed in order to figure out

74
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,760
whether they really care whether you
want to make sure you're designing these

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,260
days you had a clear sense of what we
can do together once the tool flex to do

76
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,960
that and then be different goals through
this right maybe just trying to compete

77
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,690
in barney is keeping having all the
assets and your comments really hard to

78
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,300
not doing a security system if you're
going out stabilisation just do you

79
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,400
implement or managed by and then that's
actually did something they could also

80
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,400
be able to do it really set something
they know you can be my problem that you

81
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,669
need to fix leaky ceiling so you can get
better right

82
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:28,490
likenesses Microsystems talking about
the need to have things been broadened

83
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,140
organizations may be doing it for that
that's just how many do you mean there's

84
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,689
nothing around just about any credence
to that things get out there

85
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,190
hav two get you excited to have an idea
of what this information can be used for

86
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,670
it to be in your profits they go where
you're going to use it at your house and

87
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:55,349
then also who is israeli pointed out did
management decisions and so because the

88
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,769
person you're doing something that skill
numbers will be back with TV today

89
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:10,170
credit card and if you start with only
two fingers is yes it may not be the

90
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,360
thing that's most relevant to the
organization within the move will soon

91
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,759
be big and then taking people's minds
now that is a big number of that that's

92
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,749
the most important thing I've got a good
because I had biggest numbers may not be

93
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:35,889
a case you didn't hate it is always have
a plan for us in haiti needs is more

94
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:44,579
pieces presentation pointed out that he
didn't waste is different facts and

95
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:48,939
we're gonna be collecting large-scale
data that's still pretty compelling

96
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:55,969
story and you won't miss tilly noticed
recently that you're thinking about your

97
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,249
interview with the data management what
you won't be able to tell people that

98
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:09,740
you got out of this when she's running
tool when I think that in terms of what

99
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,389
you doing it for you today when she read
it and how will review organization

100
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:22,929
dedicated to consider especially if you
think about it is that they're different

101
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:29,999
approaches to collecting data and how
that affects he received a lot of tools

102
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:37,410
like the entertainer something like that
he didn't show what I needed to go and

103
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:37,779
run

104
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:44,279
something like that proxy agency entire
environment and come back with results

105
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,819
and there's some pros and cons to do in
this way you get your operation get it

106
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:49,979
free pictures

107
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,920
entire site but has some drawbacks too
bad for statistics unless you have the

108
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,110
ability to go in manually we got the
ball toss it into Eutelsat's to you for

109
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:11,069
the site to get better accuracy had the
obligation all that there's actually the

110
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:15,219
weather PCs measures to help me hard to
get the configuration policy all those

111
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:24,949
different environments and so it's good
I mean you can go and he did you get

112
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:33,809
back some information they may not be
actual 2006 and require a lot of TV and

113
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:41,699
the action and may not be open-ended and
there he is he's here Asians by his

114
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:48,949
behavior driven development and it's
gonna be a breeding with verifiable

115
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:55,500
facts about the environment with your
existing security is here since you're

116
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,129
not texting to say everything I can
possibly be wrong but you're not running

117
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:04,279
the entire pizza get tested and click
Test against very specific things during

118
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,689
stance is itself with some ppl right but
as he defended thing it's a measurable

119
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,689
came there is a right

120
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,890
it doesn't require that you follow you
figured out how to use a handful looking

121
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,970
to get this I could come back to
criticize the approved list you have to

122
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:33,140
test that they don't want you to be
taken into consideration the testicles

123
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,340
report is now moving parts to it and
what I just 22 specific actionable war

124
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,040
because you can clearly defined problem
in terms of what's wrong with this idea

125
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,819
it does have to go back a few that
specific yet to read more test is

126
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,770
required to build up do you have a lead
on getting a little more working getting

127
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,780
it started with interstate compacts are
measurable metrics will there's no false

128
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:11,500
positives you can do something with the
environment and counties at your trading

129
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,290
can also directly t-shirt your actions
so let's say you're going to see your

130
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,630
exact indexes have access to all right

131
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,300
hesitation or tell them the excess funds
will see a list of things that they have

132
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:36,130
to go back and fix it through you keep
people get because its point I'm scared

133
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:45,100
he says he tried to call in terms of
automation and there's somebody that

134
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:53,900
like he does not meet people at the
police yet the and then that's a

135
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,110
different mindset right to ask if you're
measuring the reports are going to

136
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,800
management about police yes he just
missed you how many people had access to

137
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,469
their lives he said he sincerely
mediations their focus on being able to

138
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,540
get to hang out a lot of work across the
entire

139
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,589
for taking away excess same way that you
know that's what the team in different

140
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:20,459
directions

141
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,319
architectural approach to the problem as
opposed to a whack-a-mole but and this

142
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:38,459
is a measure that this created history
by kidder's persistent XSS has given

143
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,449
range he's very be aware the excess
luggage things like that

144
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:49,470
received more street for and yeah we see
it over time you get more participation

145
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,740
James of how you're asking that question
why you need a scummy people have

146
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,930
actually deployed the hazards regardless
of whether it is reporting that you've

147
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,849
got to the point that they return right
it's a simple yes or no answer every

148
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,160
time he gets more specific things like
to the UPS Store Policies things like

149
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,469
that but you guys he is giving
directions and getting the most texts

150
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:23,540
that the answer is both in the section
domains after US environment in the

151
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,439
reason why they do it that way and it
works negotiation and it's a good

152
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,850
project right and they have in terms of
having a plan for what to happen without

153
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,589
a big deal because the customer can get
there are three platforms like a dressy

154
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:44,019
shoes right to know is he's going make
like know that data will happen with the

155
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:48,930
customer has a direct relationship if
you're in a position that we're dealing

156
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,069
with internal teams there may be more
different you know some organizations

157
00:15:53,069 --> 00:16:03,019
most viewers in the mail you may want to
look at things are a bit more towards

158
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:07,510
the report on those types of things
little guy duties so your bedtime

159
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,520
stories that

160
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:17,770
want them to do so before you start and
probably cruise lines and time thinking

161
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,390
about how does the other hand old is it
going to be pushy team in the directions

162
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,720
I want to go

163
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:35,920
doesn't have the data that helped make a
bogey something that you want them with

164
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,640
some ideas but it's another thing to
sometimes you would like to ask you a

165
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,560
question is how much you can guess who
wins that a little bit more integrated

166
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,960
against environmental laws and they go
through the engineer to walk through all

167
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,210
of them see between the real stuff like
that then sometimes it's hard to hear

168
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,329
granite slab a similar with their
environment you coming to them and say

169
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:10,819
yeah and it's truly you've never heard
of before and I don't understand this

170
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,129
out play and see how you can help me
figure out there yet but this year

171
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,730
years of the world I think because just
formed to what they're used to maybe see

172
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:35,850
their environments and there is a tool
that they are you familiar with it also

173
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,689
produces win they don't necessarily have
to do this outside forces trying to

174
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,940
reach outside in a great things that
they've already got the bully and put

175
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,070
the security of the nation in their
natural environment and he's not

176
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,510
completely boring today and it's hard to
existing workflow design some separate

177
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,990
workload that has to be maintained
separately in the environment

178
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:11,910
any good he's done a lot of this where
we are if you change the RAM get people

179
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:23,730
to do projects that you love so for
example complaints things we've been

180
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:30,410
schaeffler reintegrate into Jenkins and
Jack were busy get it was requested by

181
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,290
the committee requests were from the
same person wasn't purity right and so

182
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,470
you can kill on that or any second now
so we made in beijing has to build the

183
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,650
rebuilding projects meeting has a
billion list all the third party writers

184
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,250
who did this he will you still be an
attractive third-party libraries

185
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:58,570
organization and go to third parties
like every component checker hehehe

186
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,210
going between the third party libraries
use external farm all received your do

187
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:13,419
you give us a TWC is there anyone in
this world can go upto put in place not

188
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,890
only their third party libraries around

189
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,760
day eighty-one things here but he has
the ability to make comments like these

190
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:27,540
things like this could be a serious
applicable to that environment probably

191
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,309
skip Jack Jack Nadel

192
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:39,260
awesome that you know he take effect
they can track whether or not they love

193
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,590
it for its legacy

194
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:54,799
$0.35 the world by Gary they will get
their tax obligations as well as we

195
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,450
mentioned a second this is also good for
reactive prove that happens he go ahead

196
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:10,490
and sure that happens in life processes
are needed because they say they're very

197
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,140
specific and open-ended problems
beginning a middle and senior project

198
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,820
measurable because it's faster results
it's actually built in trouble if you

199
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,700
agree to the things that they are to
using right now it's eighty eight

200
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,169
centuries of damages is a few exceptions
center here or yes things like that in a

201
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:37,340
useful tool to do you said we'll smoke
out there in the work was there exists

202
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:46,668
is looking for building your own thing
that separates the environment is made

203
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:53,570
up of the big questions right and you
build vs by cycle and is it really so

204
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,370
you just never ending cycle more than

205
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,510
didn't seem right like you start up
anything its acquisition its outsourced

206
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,120
IT guy and then you only want me anymore
said you're becoming keep trying out

207
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,300
today he said the bill then you have to
be made into the back to buying when

208
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:20,230
they get here here's a guy quincy about
buying and then you give in turn himself

209
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,010
everything will keep and then see you
realize that in terms of both that's

210
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,370
good condition that can only help you
with that problem is you certain natural

211
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:38,129
way of doing things but there is a lot
of stuff in the Boro environment that

212
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:44,340
you can see over that everybody has
their projects are you going to publish

213
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,230
the ad be there to love right

214
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,980
measured a common stocks around them so
even if you don't know if he can still

215
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,070
lose the source code yourself there is a
lot of examples out there had been

216
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:04,280
deployed appt architecture and allow you
to do you ideas and the environment and

217
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,220
sanitation is cleaning solutions that
great pics where it says okay you or

218
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:16,809
your organization is very difficult yes
can you guys been doing yard sale or

219
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,250
point out there trying to censor the
nation the great victory he said well

220
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,460
before they commissioned to central
place where you goin out over ukraine

221
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,050
together

222
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:38,059
licenses place that he sees a good thing
that you had to go through a lot of time

223
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,220
last year I talked about the differences
in behavior driven development tools

224
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:49,130
that are out there will either run this
visual example right knee in the

225
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:56,010
environment and they point where the
security Associated model where you goin

226
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,240
good home security

227
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,050
and you going out English exactly what
the test is exactly what they expected

228
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,620
result is in with the old condition is
and they had to you can pick up exactly

229
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,320
what you're texting not testing and
using something like that whatever

230
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,750
there's tons of tests you heard peter
did he know whether they're not going

231
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,910
back to all the different types of the
Opera and see that was behavior and all

232
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:28,110
your thoughts about things that you will
be able to test the big maybe his if

233
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,580
you're gay

234
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,570
whether you're going to buy or borrow
against he suffered after 12 I double

235
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:41,570
that highlighted years at the end that
no one is able to use people who

236
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,669
conducts actually experience inside you
particularly like she does take that six

237
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:52,850
months to a year in 2008 said you can
buy your to build out earlier than that

238
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,360
to get where you're going to be able to
launch his by the year twenty something

239
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,709
that big you want to say you're going to
be a plan to design the smaller towns he

240
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,660
gets more action more pieces as you go
as opposed to taking off the entire

241
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:14,180
project all it wants the menu design a
BB guns from the project we've been

242
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,160
working on it been since they may have
two different projects due to technology

243
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,010
standards

244
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,800
basically ATI's let us get incremental
successes as we build out the

245
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:32,310
environments as busy doing everything
Monday architectural designs they were

246
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:39,090
free tools and you poor thing try to
extract details from the rest of the

247
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,860
environment Mrs Rinehart you may use to
chat tools may be used until fireman's

248
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:50,990
maybe there is a need two seconds out
because of that there's only two that

249
00:24:50,990 --> 00:25:00,410
it's actually better not example right
he told that wraps around the test upp

250
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,580
measurable metrics designed around the
test what the answer is only got the

251
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,050
answer in a different way and then the
tools and give you things that you're a

252
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,899
helicopter rides in scale-out doing
business separate from the quarantine

253
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,250
because scoring just a queuing system
back to be capped a single machine into

254
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,250
machines

255
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:31,440
the report itself to go ahead that is a
separate environments and he added that

256
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,940
he is a very same to you and say I want
this way I want it that way he said

257
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,639
by his side making a TI amor that's up
to you pulled in making going pull it

258
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:49,699
out and say that they wanted to keep a
very so ready for my bday wins it simply

259
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,120
goes and use it to create a pirate
parrot Marcus fires that makes it comes

260
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,860
in handy for the ride ahead and start
over again

261
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:08,269
different partisan basis the pipes for
dynamic variables of course because he

262
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:15,440
seems like he's a host hosting did you
doing complex rules which are

263
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:25,119
configuration and I it's something you
think a lot of time thinking about 20

264
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,379
you I had heard all the stories

265
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:33,080
looking like they had made plans to
plant trees shrubs and that plans where

266
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,899
they belong to specific information that
leads into tools basically plans those

267
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:45,928
you any money sent it into the season
information and beautifully a mission to

268
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:52,580
planet 51 the private sector working on
in terms of Syria a nation is had made a

269
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,949
picture of your organization we can only
using Excel you may not have a listed

270
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,080
everything that you need to be able to
scan and the environment where you can

271
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,320
even be saying to see that environment
or anything is going to change anything

272
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,269
if that's even better production
products I'm currently working on his

273
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:17,200
interview with a picture in the
organization both engines will you can

274
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,809
do what we think we had as well as
external tools like to see a project

275
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,820
like this he would be here

276
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:34,360
organization organization sometimes be
there he demanded around

277
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,850
we're meeting at the meeting go along
with four other third-party service at

278
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:45,879
your place or immediate security to
customers customers who made his heirs

279
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,830
to the server is your orders right and
even if those types of mappings by

280
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,800
energy trying to do you think that scale
is the only internet question without

281
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:09,629
like creating a database stuff and then
I like talking to ensure that these

282
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:18,930
actions that is great but she isn't
there is he going is that offers readers

283
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:28,440
something to us but when you're looking
for only 11 big tennis is it was that

284
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,050
one specific tense since anything to do
with some parts that make it hard to be

285
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,659
scalable because you only hang on Sloopy
reports there may be more commanding

286
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:44,280
didn't even use your finger to Singapore
where they need to go out and do certain

287
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,850
things can happen with the tools that
your plan to spend some time thinking

288
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,080
about that and then treat me different
for each person ever to have until this

289
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,429
regularization but I intend to see a
building like this is Cameron the

290
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:12,620
individual tasks all those things and
there is a recognized because you're

291
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,649
right

292
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:22,930
but no problems here you have a large
enterprise environments you block recipe

293
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,090
I've read UPI's it was hard to get fired

294
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:33,419
there's no nothing to say he's growing
so you have to have sincere alternative

295
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:47,060
is sometimes it is sometimes wait a bit
so impasse is we can you put it up and

296
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,090
then you take all of your unit test and
you had to you tend to run through the

297
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:59,189
two impossible to practice its reporting
of all being tested and then that he did

298
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:05,390
the fingerprints of collection uses of
you going with easy access to figure out

299
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,590
a way you can get this proxy into the
tool to create a baseline at your end

300
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,649
users can you tell if you're trying to
do things for us a lot of musicians to

301
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:23,030
do miss entire slobs things that they
did receive the item is totally serious

302
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:31,879
cases usually key technology to be here
is that he intentionally by me to answer

303
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,860
that for you when it's needed to hear
you're looking at that and so did

304
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:50,350
gospel's high levels this is bad for my
colleagues will be here until you talk

305
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,949
about when it will talk to the server
trying to figure out what it's like

306
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:03,590
versions of the house and stuff like
that little like howie hello and he gave

307
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,039
his he said he forbade all these things
will resign his architecture

308
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,820
good friend instead of contents etc
talked to a couple you get a CI server

309
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,830
which was basically eyes and he did I
knew that he would be using it to

310
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,210
whether they actually he might have to
try looking ahead to separate video yes

311
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:34,039
overseas for a few days so you put in
her seat where readers stands got this

312
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:39,250
can be done or six to go back and look
at the statistics agency ass booty huge

313
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,690
and their backgrounds in to see this
reminds me of wet weather is heated to

314
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,850
all of you create an islamic search here
in case you're going early heady you

315
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:56,199
know when you've got that has metadata
the researchers that is all the guys in

316
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:04,269
such technology used to make this happen
and we join the technology is used his

317
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:12,230
salary is a banking system that you can
see where this place is going back to my

318
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,419
readers like about report where r
protection is that these things out

319
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:26,710
isn't it time you thinkin bout you may
be happy and he went as planned to mark

320
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:33,350
personalize it with the technologies are
and how you can separate them out using

321
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:38,178
my eye he has that had been done OK at
this time

322
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:46,009
do something there but there is a
regular basis for Mozilla media and you

323
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:54,730
can see a big check it out there so
we're pretty cool to be separated out

324
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:02,110
the keys a film then they had to tap
into English football the metadata right

325
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,600
we see the same principles of design in
the other tools that you walk out to go

326
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,090
take a look at things that have been
deployed before you'll find a lot of

327
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,580
short passes a law that very busy you
these in the way that you can sign hangs

328
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:25,899
just reviewing those we're going to see
a movie that's assertion this guy wants

329
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:33,489
so we've been using our been known as
silly things like me and like america to

330
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,080
go on a date school and come back with
results

331
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:47,820
area seeking base we're sitting outside
a very opposite of what I do but it is

332
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,939
very specific question is where is it
Yes No base and so we done this they are

333
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,450
done using these things then we saw a
lot of time to think about how we

334
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:05,029
redesigned it before we actually tackled
the indentation he says he will build

335
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:12,760
for the nation's small stuff he's got a
lot of long will you be loved it now we

336
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:21,879
know anything it's easier to you still
use it like any tools every doctor had a

337
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:28,989
REST API so that means you can be quick
wins they create a couple years on

338
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:37,040
Friday maybe she's just like this guy
still doin and her cleaning the laws we

339
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,679
still going on

340
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,020
and smaller from Saltley be able to pay
back manager jeff is coming out of it so

341
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,259
you can keep getting back with its
products may be progress is that there

342
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,760
will be a value at the end of this this
child when do you think these things out

343
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,500
to the sea to get information and then
also get you back on it I guess is you

344
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,000
go to tools you need it is backing off a
plan for how to handle that can be

345
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,140
serious like myself again building is
getting on earth and getting big you

346
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:21,759
know this is gonna be back in just got
them rose out of the calm down and focus

347
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,480
on the patio products because you're
seeing mired in technical details like

348
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:36,030
what doctor platforms you need to know
if you're going to take it easy and

349
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:42,630
great value in relation to get out of it
for you will know what I think about the

350
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,660
statistics is getting directions I'm
thinking about you have the people to

351
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:55,558
Manchaca whatever it when it comes out
without tool reports I had a great tool

352
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,410
to never seen the actionable

353
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:06,140
baby and you had to hold as being
designs the real nicely when they hear

354
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,500
that designs he goes to Sweden foolish
might be more actionable 14 have options

355
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:16,220
design of it I don't think that
everything has to be a great insecurity

356
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,509
texas leads the build process ugh can
you share your satellite seattle City

357
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:29,590
Jackson the things get hard as API you
can run against Ted Lilly said you know

358
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:37,040
how long I W that doesn't involve decide
who will buy project that would be

359
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:48,160
simple and they just keep our way he
said it seems like networks and whether

360
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,440
we've got a lot of stuff before there's
a lot of silly points in their

361
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,410
presentations we've been going through
these lessons are trying to build up a

362
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,819
lot of them easy yet the end you go to
you that works is that we can go to

363
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:09,750
steal everything you got they've got
these issues but they got what you

364
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,420
wanted to hear anything about it with
the county's word listen to their talks

365
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,530
because it's it's more than just lost
the actual has to use operationally

366
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:27,920
and so that they go ahead right now is
the unhappy yeah

367
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,970
talk about it he he's going with it

368
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:44,200
yeah because in order to have a truly
useful for the second year in dire need

369
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,950
you to do is making a lot decision to
your company and so it said you know I

370
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,180
can't outsource a bit when he removed
everything in that environment for your

371
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:05,919
specific it is he said he has not
something useful and they fired because

372
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,500
he added that much as the nation's main
gate were so there's some Press article

373
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,960
about the talk about scary how did you
become a good look at you may cancel it

374
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,790
because the implementation of it right

375
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,730
yeah I love your column also just
because I can be built into work for the

376
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:49,740
peace that we had at least a funny
because I give you every day she's gonna

377
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:57,270
look like there is a sense that you're
going to be a little more cookies

378
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:01,750
metrics la about the security
environment need to have that much the

379
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,010
leader
