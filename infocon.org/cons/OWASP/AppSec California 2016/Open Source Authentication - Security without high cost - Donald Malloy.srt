1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:32,009
afternoon everyone I trust we r had a
nice lunch too sleepy I'll try and keep

2
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,510
you entertained a little bit if if I see
somebody not novel poked him in the head

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,409
a little bit actually used to have a
history professor was really great with

4
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:50,530
chuck was actually should have been a
picture so today we're going to talk a

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:59,140
little bit about security without the
high cost you all have seen one-time

6
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:07,490
passwords and RSA tokens Vasco tokens
and many users are still paying examine

7
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,619
amount of money for that I'm gonna show
you ways that should not have to be that

8
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:17,530
way this technology has been around for
25 years and I consider it a commodity

9
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,670
ok so one of the things I have a couple
of girls I work for this company less

10
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,439
experts-- but I'm also involved in both
which is initiative open authentication

11
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,048
which we'll see about that in a minute
so pardon me but I have to manually do

12
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,710
my slides cos I didn't bring

13
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,449
remote control so what do we need strong
authentication think we heard some

14
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,180
things between yesterday and today about
the need for security with the front

15
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,630
thats continues to go along if you look
at ten million americans just last year

16
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,860
alone over three and a half billion
dollars worth of online fraud website

17
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:06,590
stealing passwords is more than a hobby
right it is its professional so you know

18
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:14,650
this is it's a growing threat of
cybercrime into you see we're if that

19
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,739
was gonna grow yeah so what it is called
companies having comment I started using

20
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,870
a slide like this about six seven years
ago and had four companies on it but

21
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,510
it's really interesting the things they
all have in common is as you know there

22
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:35,920
are trying well target in the year 2000
introduced what's known is today a chip

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,809
card as we're now starting to get with
our credit cards for a chip on the

24
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:47,030
credit card they introduced this as a
target Visa card fifteen years ago they

25
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,000
were leaders they were at the forefront
unfortunately there

26
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,530
CTO told the CEO that was slowing manage
transactions in the killed the program

27
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:06,190
in 2004 that's the same CEO was fired
when they had their big breach had the

28
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,220
continued using the chip card they would
not have had that big breach and that's

29
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,510
why we're starting to see the chip cards
finally being rolled out in the United

30
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,880
States so you know this is just a
smattering as to what's been going on in

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,049
the world as you see some of them you
know this just a graph showing the size

32
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:29,989
of the hacks right one of the things
that I saw early on

33
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,620
number of years ago I was saying was was
hacked right the leaders of the tokens

34
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,230
every two hundred and thirty million of
their tokens were compromised

35
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:52,090
because some engineer responded to some
fishing site got a hold of his computer

36
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,870
and the rest is history but the sad part
about that this is the leading security

37
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,850
company in the world and they kept the
sea files on the same server that they

38
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,079
had the email on how stupid is there
after the massive hack where they have a

39
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,709
lot of people downloading videos from
their service if they're smart they

40
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,560
would have to separate networks that are
not connected one with their personal

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,720
their company stuff and then one for the
customer-facing stuff and that's what

42
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,360
we're starting to get to where you have
to actually cut court and keep them

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,440
independent from one another because as
we've seen with the cars if it's all on

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,780
the same network it's gonna get hat one
way or the other so it's something to to

45
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,960
recall so just looking a little bit
about the market size this is good news

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,169
for everybody in the security business
because we're all guaranteed to have a

47
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,620
job and if you're not involved in
security and that's why you hear get

48
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,130
involved in it because you will have a
job so the market is growing

49
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,000
dramatically the I T spending is is
going two hundred and seventy billion

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,910
dollars that's no small potatoes it's
going to double the rate of the I D

51
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,280
budget even though some companies are
shrinking near eighty budget overall the

52
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,429
security side of it is is growing up and
some companies that never had security

53
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,930
and now starting to have realizing that
they need to have it I look at companies

54
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,910
such as credit unions as police
departments small organizations of 1,500

55
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,979
people they all need to have some mighty
security they can't just sit there and

56
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,150
have a password protecting their network
it's you know not really cool

57
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:46,120
so the only growth slowing is the fact
that we're seeing massive consolidation

58
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,940
so I've been involved in this
organization as I mentioned called oath

59
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,390
and in the last 10 years I've watched
probably 35 companies get acquired that

60
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,940
were all part of both semantic made a
couple hid made a couple Microsoft made

61
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,610
a couple computer associates intel's
meet three Jamal those meet for and the

62
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,880
list goes on and on and on all the
little guys are getting bought by the

63
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,260
bigger guys because they want to be able
to provide one-stop shopping to their

64
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,490
customers they won't be able to walk
into a Alcoa Pepsi and say I can do

65
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,640
whatever you need you want to buy apples
to apples oranges I have oranges I have

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,830
the whole game and I can provide your
email security your web security you

67
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,080
single sign-on I can do it all and
that's good in bed because when the

68
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,650
market matures that means the big
players get involved for years ago five

69
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,580
years ago now Intel did not have a
security group believe it or not

70
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,590
now they have a security group that has
thousands of people involving Microsoft

71
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,599
didn't have very small security group
until they bought from factor for years

72
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,740
ago and now they have a big security
team and so if you with a company that

73
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,010
doesn't have a security team maybe you
can lead the way so we're we've been

74
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,150
probably most of the people in this room
weren't even alive then but the first

75
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:22,310
computer generated password 1961 and I
think a number

76
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,969
little bit later on but some statistics
just last year alone there were seven

77
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,330
hundred and eighty reaches in all
categories all different parts right

78
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:38,859
finance government business does not
matter healthcare 569 million records

79
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,150
now if there are no duplicates which I'm
sure there were duplicates but if there

80
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,818
were no duplicates that's half the
population of the United States that's

81
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:50,870
huge

82
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,229
if you think about it that means have
two people in this room have been

83
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:07,199
compromised whether they know it or not
go back 10 years over 850 850 million

84
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,000
records this is big business

85
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:19,370
the credit card companies United States
is about 27 percent of the credit card

86
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:26,800
volume today we're about 50% of the
fraud now I've talked with Visa

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,690
MasterCard and American Express many
years many years ago about putting a

88
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,570
chip on the card

89
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,709
those of us that have been to Europe
have seen with the europeans have done

90
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:41,069
they've had the chip card since the
nineties right was started by the French

91
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:48,570
in 91 92 as a way to get rid of the
phone theft that was happening under

92
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,649
public payphones it was a phone card
that's how the chip card business get

93
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:58,350
started until they still the largest
card manufacturers are French companies

94
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,190
that's why French very strong and
security one of the reasons why is

95
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,430
because they've been involved in this
for so long

96
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:32,060
but when I talk to visa yes yes the
first question about the slowness of the

97
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:39,630
chip transaction because the initial
setup in the us- was home extra and

98
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,480
everything goes when you swipe him extra
that goes to all my heart goes to the

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,950
processor goes to your issuer bank it
checks out to balance is good checks out

100
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,920
that there's not a fraudulent card comes
back to unit does that mean about the

101
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,670
second half that is very mature in its
very quick the chip side of it is a

102
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,689
different story when you insert the
chipas we're starting to have if

103
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,930
anybody's used your trip so far in it
does take longer because that has to

104
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,790
stay for the entire transaction when you
insert the chip it runs the whole until

105
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:20,459
then that check out person hits the
final enter key then it processes it so

106
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,550
the chip has to stay in there that's the
reason

107
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,209
because a lot of times I think in europe
they're still batching it they may not

108
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:37,069
be 100% online is that historically has
been the USA has been online and Europe

109
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,219
has been in a batch with a send them
periodically they don't send immediately

110
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,220
yes

111
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:01,800
wave technology is is NFC for you those
are you to know do not know in its

112
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,130
contactless so the chip today is a
contact chip that were coming up with

113
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,709
the contactless chip many of the
capabilities are there but it has not

114
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,239
been implemented because well that's
what Apple is using right and then

115
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,550
Samsung to pay Apple pay Google pay
they're all using the NFC technology

116
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,550
it's happening but it's it's a slow
transition because it takes education

117
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,880
you have to educate I've tried to use
mine and the lady told me to swipe the

118
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,439
card I said no I already tagged no you
didn't swipe the card I says I tapped it

119
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:41,599
but you didn't swipe I don't have to
swipe she did not understand there's a

120
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,079
whole education process to slap in the
face that make her understand

121
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:55,410
didn't so what happened with the fraud
when I talk to Visa MasterCard and stuff

122
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,230
years ago they said well the cost of
fraud is down here the cost of

123
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,949
implementation is here and now there has
shifted about ten years ago

124
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,319
you know it used to be when you travel
to Europe you supposed to come home in

125
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,029
kind of your card because it was he was
going to get hacked if you went to

126
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,529
Europe but today the card to getting
hacked in the United States as everybody

127
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,740
here had 11 or more of their cards
stacked I had all my credit card checked

128
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,540
in the last two years and had to get a
new one could somebody made some weird

129
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,010
internet charges on it so

130
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,410
the fraud is all coming here United
States is now the weakest link is the

131
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,890
rest of the world has been implementing
the chip card so now what's going to

132
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:45,110
happen which is what's interesting is
you know things like this so when we get

133
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,530
online this is where the chip does not
really affect you because doesn't

134
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,280
protect you and your online because you
don't have a card reader you not

135
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,630
inserting your card into a terminal as
you would a point of sale so as our

136
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,760
online transactions are growing so is
the fraud growing in every country that

137
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,060
implemented EMV which is the chip card
the online fraud has has gone up and so

138
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,930
this is where the fraudsters are going
now it's like a balloon squeeze one end

139
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,989
and it goes up the other side they're
not going to go away I'm gonna go get a

140
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,860
legitimate job they're just gonna find
another way to get our money and so now

141
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,250
we need to protect the online because
that's where all of our business is

142
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:35,360
going right I spent probably two-thirds
of my transactions are online these days

143
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,540
I don't I hardly ever going to a
shopping mall not trying to be very fun

144
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,020
so the hackers are everywhere it's big
business

145
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:56,920
their nation states supported by by
nefarious governments there like mafia

146
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,910
organized crime there there are rings
you know that operate in in cities with

147
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,540
a steal people's credit card numbers and
then you know you can go by you know the

148
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,599
bulk of 10,000 credit card numbers like
10 cents a number you can go find more

149
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,220
things online very easily it it's
everywhere so we need to protect against

150
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,170
that so as I talked a little bit about
you know last year with some of the

151
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,819
breaches you know we look at the numbers
the numbers are staggering but one thing

152
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,720
that's interesting here if you look at
what they got

153
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,540
not only did they get social security
numbers email addresses if you look at

154
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,110
the the Office of Personnel Management
which is our government

155
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,670
government employees look at the data
that they they got complete background

156
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:52,099
social security numbers and I don't want
to be conspiracy theorist but if I were

157
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:59,240
a government bad government does not
like the United States and wants to to

158
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,930
take us down and find out everything
about us what better way than to hack

159
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,310
into things like this and build a
complete picture of the structure of our

160
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,859
government where they're going what
they're doing

161
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,079
who they are who their family as you can
put together a number of these breaches

162
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,910
tonight just to steal money its
information and they're going to take

163
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:32,079
that information and they can build a
complete portrait of how we operate and

164
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,459
how we work

165
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:38,439
not saying that's happening but it could
and I we could write a story about that

166
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:46,350
right so as I said the transient C chip
and pin is coming in the United States

167
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,170
but it's not a complete implementation
those of us that have been to Europe its

168
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,380
chip and pin in the United States its
chip in signature signatures not a

169
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,360
security pin they implemented ship in
signature because it was an faster

170
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,529
easier implementation the pin will be
coming later on but we may all just

171
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,740
moving to a pay wave so it may not
happen

172
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:37,130
so just a little more trends yes yes so
as I said the fried moving landline and

173
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,460
mobile payment you promised is growing
exponentially which is a huge

174
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:49,970
opportunity so why now the pressure is
mounting rapid growth of these attacks

175
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,050
right the information that needs
protection is growing more and more of

176
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:03,020
our information is is online I think I'm
more worried about losing my phone in my

177
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:10,010
wallet cases there's more is more to be
lost with my phone in my wallet my

178
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,430
wallet has five credit cards in in a
couple of other worthless cards you know

179
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,839
I can cancel but if I lose my phone man
im in deep trouble cuz that's my whole

180
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,458
life is in there so are our company
reputations are at risk our leadership

181
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:31,370
reputation at risk now this is what's
interesting is the PII regulation that's

182
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,139
you personally identifiable information
you saw what happened to Angela Merkel

183
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,290
and her system whatever they put a hand
up in the picture was taken over him and

184
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:49,190
her finger prints were copied from that
photograph now her fingerprints are gone

185
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:56,430
they're out there you can get more
fingerprints once that information is

186
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:02,480
out there and if a hacker gets a hold of
it they can impersonate you and that's

187
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,650
very difficult to make that revocable
will see you love me more about that

188
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,700
later on that's a concern

189
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:17,580
anybody has seen incest 3.com for those
of us that live in Orange County he was

190
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,080
a real-life case of why hopefully nobody
works against St dot com

191
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,449
why you don't know how to use them
because if you use incest 3.com they

192
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:37,500
take your DNA and it becomes theirs and
they get hacked houdini's gone there was

193
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,169
a man in Orange County who was he was
acquitted but he was accused of murder

194
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:49,789
and he went to go to court because of
his DNA because he went on to

195
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,059
ancestry.com in his DNA was on incest
3.com and they accused him of murder

196
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,559
from the end from the DNA at the scene

197
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,750
turns out it was a distant cousin of his
because as you know the DNA goes through

198
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,649
a selection process of down to maybe you
know it was down into the level of maybe

199
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:12,750
you know a million people around the
world would have this DNA but he he

200
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,620
almost went to jail for murder he didn't
commit because of what he did on

201
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,209
ancestry.com so just a word too I just
something you might not want to

202
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:29,029
participate in so having strong security
it is a competitive advantage trade

203
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,200
those that don't have it

204
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,710
are going to get in trouble so here is
some number of authentication methods

205
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,980
for like one time password things we
have simple passwords we have challenges

206
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,580
with one-time passwords Republic key
with the single sign-on we are adaptive

207
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,570
authentication in here a little bit more
about that and biometric sampras

208
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,389
technologies hardware software tokens
sms sms works great as long as you

209
00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:00,070
health connection right if you don't
have a connection challenging sometimes

210
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,139
Bill Gates declared to pass her dead was
twelve years ago

211
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:13,090
so there are a number of issues that
face I T managers and I think you know

212
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,109
we're dealing with some companies where
the people don't have a clue of what

213
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:25,820
securities all about I show you know my
neighbors you know what I've been doing

214
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:35,418
and they just kind of look at me like is
a need for that ass hard so we need to

215
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:40,340
learn right so I can't tell you a little
bit about what Otis Otis initiative for

216
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,199
open authentication is a number of
companies that was formed to work

217
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,729
together to drive adoption for strong
authentication that's open across all

218
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:56,029
networks ok was created nine years ago
and there were hundreds of companies

219
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,970
that were involved some companies choose
to stay a member some companies don't

220
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,029
because the algorithms are free and open
source and they're available for anybody

221
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:11,340
to download and use so we took existing
standards and we brought a reference

222
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,039
architecture for strong authentication
for users the purpose behind it was to

223
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,119
reduce the cost and complexity of
adopting strong authentication now have

224
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,209
to say at nine years ago I don't think
we really accomplished what we wanted to

225
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,109
do was to we were able to get the
standards and we're able to get what we

226
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:36,158
wanted to get people using it but we
didn't reduce the cost and that's what I

227
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,029
would like to hopefully do I want us to
reach I think everybody should be able

228
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,779
to use strong authentication without
being burdened by high costs ok so here

229
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,879
are some of the challenges that that
caused all that he started informed was

230
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:55,149
the theft of confidential data the
inability to share that data without

231
00:21:55,149 --> 00:22:03,879
risk and then the lack of a viable
single sign-on ok so we address these

232
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:09,070
challenges with standard technology who
took an all-encompassing approach ok I

233
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,330
everybody that was involved as a vendor
in strong authentication remember that

234
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,770
one time

235
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,830
and here's a partial list of some of the
members some of the members of companies

236
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,010
are recognizable and and some of them
aren't there that use it like you won't

237
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,590
see computer associates on he wants to
Google or Microsoft but they all use it

238
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,990
for those that attend the RSA Conference
next month in San Francisco anybody here

239
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:47,780
going ok so RSA Conference was started
by the company twenty years ago it's the

240
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,990
largest security conference pretty much
in the United States and there will be

241
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:02,400
at least 30 companies that will be using
the author in their solutions they want

242
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,150
maybe advertising it but it's there
anybody have Google identicator on their

243
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:15,470
phones that use the other algorithms so
basically the author reference

244
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,610
architecture was to establish a common
ground raid the reference architectures

245
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,979
centered and around the side of it with
the four guiding principles of the

246
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,190
royalty free Open Specifications the
embedding and innovation of the device

247
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,950
and embedding the risk-based validation
framework and the interoperable modules

248
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,760
and inversion to came out with
risk-based authentication and identity

249
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:52,760
sharing so the the algorithms that were
created one was a HTTP and 88 OTP so

250
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,260
their first one is event-based and the
next one is time-based and then the

251
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:05,560
third was with the okra which happen but
it's a challenge response algorithm yes

252
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:13,159
question is any relation to fight over
all good question I was going to talk a

253
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,610
little bit of al-qaida yes actually we
have worked a little bit with Fido Fido

254
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,860
is trying to remove the passwords so
they're trying to do not have any

255
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,139
password at all and using like whatever
it is about metric or something to to to

256
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,190
log in and they're trying to take over
more like a step further it's almost

257
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,650
there they're using a look a challenge
response and in its like a half of PKI

258
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:47,170
it's not a full PKI implementation so
it's like a PK they create a public key

259
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,400
that's that's really different but I'll
show you a little bit what we were doing

260
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,440
with the diametric symmetric key and
that similar to what what finally is

261
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,070
doing so all these three algorithms that
were created

262
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:09,610
have all been turned into standards by
the IETF and they're free to download

263
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,899
you can use them you can develop
something with him or you can come to me

264
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:22,060
and I can take area so the road map was
to create those algorithms the

265
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:27,370
credential and provisioning life cycle
with the public key symmetric container

266
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,429
and the diametric

267
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:36,380
the dynamic turkey provisioning and we
created a certification program along

268
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:44,010
with WS validation and the identity
sharing network so if you look at today

269
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:50,040
there is any form fact you want I worked
for the company that created the card

270
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,420
that's why the store them up there but
we recreated the OTP on a card that was

271
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,380
developed by a French company and was me
and Swiss company now it's French

272
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,290
company anyway and then there are soft
tokens in the regular standardized

273
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:10,270
tokens and their USP keys there is an
embedded Flash there's all sorts of

274
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,370
barriers when it's announced my arrows
show up

275
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:23,110
ok the certification program was started
a couple years ago to one of the

276
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:28,419
concerns I had because people would
choose to be a member I dot the

277
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,230
algorithms and then to Anna need to be a
member anymore and then they post on its

278
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,220
website the literature you know both
enabled certified and see how do we know

279
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,750
how do we know you implemented it
properly so we started the certification

280
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,240
program so that we could test the
interoperability because if somebody is

281
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,679
selling tokens and someone has an auth
server we want to make sure that all

282
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,559
server is going to be able to manage
those tokens properly that's the whole

283
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,970
point of it so we had numerous products
have been certified by a number of

284
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,600
companies well over 30 companies but
they certify both sides if you just a

285
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,928
token manufacturer you'll you'll certify
your tokens you do both you can do both

286
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:19,460
the server into token and so we have
these validation servers for both the

287
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,440
TOTP NEH OTP and there's a website which
has them listed as to what's available

288
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,980
so just just a quick review as to what
we've done right we had the

289
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:41,630
certification program we created the the
ATP's the algorithm development and

290
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:47,210
provisioning protocol portable symmetric
key container the validation protocols

291
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,990
and then we started this this thread
report and and this token identify a

292
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:58,230
namespace so anyone that's a
manufacturer of token product can get a

293
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:06,200
two-digit name for their product so that
can go in the front of their labeling

294
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,820
and and that we have the registry to
keep track of that

295
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:20,369
so in in 2015 we completed the update on
the profiles of the algorithms we

296
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:27,009
expanded the certification program and
added some enhancements the valid

297
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:35,029
specification and using UDP with with
NFC technology and moving into the SAML

298
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:44,989
2.0 of teepee I think I need to do this

299
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:54,469
ok so just a little further about the
framework there's you can see the

300
00:28:54,469 --> 00:29:00,039
authentication protocols developed
nation framework the provisioning

301
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,769
framework with the user storage and then
the token storage and it all goes across

302
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:12,649
the authentication and sharing methods
ok the framework of the way both are

303
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:18,119
structured so here's a little bit about
the oath in the fight oh so we had a web

304
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:25,289
both client API did that draft couple
years ago now it would allow the vendors

305
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:32,019
to have various plugins and have the web
applications to control the policy and

306
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,570
so this is similar to work

307
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,649
Fido is doing with the use the the
client for the OTP credentials and in

308
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:43,968
the server and client protocol so my my
company is is a member is a member of

309
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:52,320
Fido over we went to work with them and
I did not know this but you know there's

310
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,218
always politics involved in things very
well Saito was started by a couple of

311
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:05,839
people that came from whether at NOC NOC
labs but they had come from a company

312
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,899
that was bought by Symantec PGP

313
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,470
and they left start knock-knock labs and
I guess they didn't have a lotta love

314
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,280
lost for semantic and symantec is
credited with being one of the founders

315
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,160
of both it was very sign at the time so
that's why the phyto people did not want

316
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,850
to work with oath because they viewed as
being the semantic organization

317
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:42,540
something later on in life so just as a
little bit about the credential

318
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,230
provisioning we take their token
manufacture offline model and we take

319
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,320
the standard portable symmetric key
container format and then there's a

320
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,210
dynamic real-time model where we have a
dynamic symmetric key oK so that's

321
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:04,060
that's a draft and also with OTA
provisioning and there's one more there

322
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:15,570
there is a key problem working group so
that that's a the current working group

323
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:21,040
for creating IRA cease emissions so
basically the objectives were to

324
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,250
understand the full support needed for
strong authentication and to learn the

325
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,500
different approaches to supporting
strong authentication you know where

326
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:40,440
applications and take the best practices
right so the certification program was

327
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,160
to provide assurance to customers that
the products would be interoperable and

328
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,420
that's the key the so that you
implemented the old standards properly

329
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,230
and so that the customers could get best
of breed solutions and we get a couple

330
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,430
of to dress certification profiles are
introduced at RSA and a number that are

331
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:05,370
introduced throughout this year so a
typical scenario would be like a

332
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:10,350
transaction authentication and saying
you logging on to your website the bank

333
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,530
he give username password bank sends a
challenge to you

334
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,770
to create a pin and then you enter that
number onto your car do you talkin and

335
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,400
secure a new passcode which will be
generated you then into that back smitty

336
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:30,520
bank so it protects you against a man in
the middle attack all news for everybody

337
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:43,300
ok so just a little bit about the
framework as you can see on this side of

338
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:50,379
the end user with the different types of
IPSec VPNs and the web apps and the

339
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,250
servers and in the validation protocol
with every using whether it's fading

340
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:01,060
radius of your security whatnot and then
your you handle a framework with your

341
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,810
radius and then your validation
framework all going into the on top of

342
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:15,310
the infrastructure layer so now I'm
going to talk about why why is OTP still

343
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:18,770
expensive they are more than 50
companies a collaborative somewhere like

344
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:25,350
a hundred somewhat companies that have
one time password solutions and very six

345
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,820
forms and sizes right soft tokens hard
to conceive in peacetime based challenge

346
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:38,850
response based I do that should be a
commodity number of years ago I was with

347
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,760
a semiconductor company and I was
responsible the crypto chips we had one

348
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,750
competitor and we had brokers that
turned us into a commodity because there

349
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:53,940
were two of us making this product will
hear there's literally 50 75 companies

350
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,690
making these products and yet it's still
not a commodity so the model is these

351
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,950
companies try to make a lot of money and
that's great I mean I'm with a company

352
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:08,820
that its profits to but I think if we
want to spread the security out there we

353
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,679
need to do something in the past I would
show a graph that would have three

354
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,980
circles three bubbles on and one would
be cost won't be security would be

355
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:23,090
convenience and sometimes they intersect
and I would like to say that most often

356
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,500
you can get two out of the three you can
get

357
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,949
high-security I convenience but it's
going to come at a cost

358
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,790
most american consumers we want
convenience we don't give a damn about

359
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:42,159
security and we want low cost if your
government you give up a convenience

360
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,590
because you want security and of course
the cost is going to be high so there's

361
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,750
always have to balance those three
parameters no way I see it but I think

362
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,659
with strong authentication it's been
around long enough that we should be

363
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,660
able to get that caused down without
sacrificing security

364
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:12,799
so this company offers something called
Al in OTP in the AL originally stood for

365
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,570
Linux was a linux-based product once
open source but it uses the old

366
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:25,610
algorithm today and it's it's a flexible
platform for strong authentication is

367
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,810
available for free all the earth tokens
are supported our show you a list in a

368
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,640
minute and it uses this smart virtual
appliance

369
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:40,330
should be free to download and the only
cost is for support and maintenance so

370
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:49,900
the cost per user comes down from
whatever talking cost is 30 35 $40 22 as

371
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:56,800
the difference its orders of magnitude
less so works everywhere the advantages

372
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,240
that do not require client-side driver
the accepted algorithms are are open

373
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:13,009
use for OTP integration listed in the
RSC 4226 for the HMAC OTP and it

374
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,920
supports other proprietary tokens and
procedures so sending the one-time

375
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,180
passwords may be in MTN mobile
transaction number via SMS can also be

376
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:33,910
done and the options use of hardware
tokens so here is to sort of what it

377
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:39,910
what it looks like this the core of the
coral in OTP with whatever you using you

378
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,480
know whether its radius or whatever else
you have connected there and here's a

379
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,920
list this is a partial list of some of
the supported tokens you can see SafeNet

380
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,810
which is now Gemalto

381
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:59,450
you become Gemalto hid smart display a
nagger which is now over Thur Centex BR

382
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:05,319
token which has a new name valid elysee
so it it supports anybody's talking on

383
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
the market and that's that's the
important part

384
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:16,550
and it's free so just a little bit about
the authentication and integration

385
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,480
architecture so its direct
authentication integration over standard

386
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,700
protocol and then there is a plugin
based authentication so this is some of

387
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,720
the things that that was the future that
will be working on enabling to factor

388
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,770
into existing third-party authentication
server ok the codes no need to change

389
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,259
the IRA buck strong authentication
support for existing third-party servers

390
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:48,020
and develops you customize plug-in for
Windows authentication servers and a

391
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,390
little bit more about the timeline so
here are some of the things that have

392
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:57,589
been done with reference architecture
2.0 risk-based authentication and the

393
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:05,320
IETF keep the key provisioning and I'm
not going to get into the risk base

394
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,060
indication because I think it's too much
we don't have time to do so I'm gonna

395
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:18,630
skip these here and ok just talk a
little bit about technology beyond the

396
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:26,070
password so one of the things that
starting to come up in Gartner's been

397
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:32,740
been really big on this is talking about
adaptive authentication so when you look

398
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,640
at biometrics we have fingerprints iris
Voice face there's some things we can

399
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,600
check your glucose you smell your gay
there's so many ways we can monitor our

400
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:52,339
biometric but as I said if they're not
revocable that's a concern right you can

401
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:58,530
revoke your finger prints so stronger
passwords aren't really the answer right

402
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:08,440
I mean I have more than 25 passwords I
you know what we're trying to answer is

403
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,270
an identification is it really you for
those that have anybody used Apple pay

404
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:19,870
apple picking out the use the NFC chip
and there was a you know when I see him

405
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:26,620
you know inside the chip is very secure
well visa had said that the first three

406
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:33,040
to three months in a six and a half
percent right way now visas typical

407
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:43,120
fraud rate on a credit card is somewhere
around 0.16% tonight at the chip was

408
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,830
insecure laptop is very secure the chip
is very secure what the problem was the

409
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:56,250
front and the people that were getting
authenticated the banks in their rush to

410
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,850
sign people up

411
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:03,380
lowered the bar and they allowed anybody
to get an apple pay in other words

412
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,580
fraudsters which fake credit card
numbers would call up Wells Fargo Bank

413
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,569
of America and chase and say oK what's
your number here is my number and they

414
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:19,310
give so they allowed them in the front
door once you're in the front door the

415
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,520
system was really secure so there since
closed that run to him in a little bit

416
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,180
challenging about checking the
identification of the people ahead of

417
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,839
time before they signed him up so
looking at at this adaptive

418
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,870
authentication knowing what to type
doesn't get us if I give you my password

419
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:46,799
you can take it in and you're in but
behavioral analytics can confirm that

420
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,890
its you eventually we won't have to
remember password at all type of phrase

421
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:58,000
and then that's good to know that it's
really you so looking at something

422
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,730
called the behavioral advantage hard for
me to read over the hopefully you can

423
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:09,490
see that but across the top you can see
the the types of things that can't be

424
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:17,049
stolen and shared identifies the person
and all the different benefits and down

425
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,700
the side we have the different types of

426
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:29,848
modalities so behavioral has a lot of
advantages beyond the password and its

427
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:41,619
revocable and there's no PII to be
stored and so here's the key the

428
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:50,599
security technologies on on rules failed
to block this sophisticated the logs are

429
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,410
generated and ignored because the
ability to act on them

430
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:02,089
isn't there the individuals are getting
tricked rider coerced into giving up

431
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:06,210
their usernames and passwords and the
fraudsters are proficient right and

432
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:14,119
assembling these full day directors so
really using behavior to securing a

433
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,450
log-in is his Lotus ted has the latest
focal point for the cyberattacks right

434
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:25,578
and so with nothing to possess her lose
her to remember to fail this a real

435
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:31,730
benefit so we talked about them to
breaches that was two years ago so I see

436
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:40,020
when I talk about behavioral biometrics
what I mean things such as how we swipe

437
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:48,240
up on how we type and the analytics of
all that there is something along with

438
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,259
this this considered continuous
authentication so as you're working you

439
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:03,839
constantly if you're in a say in a
remote testing more check your being

440
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,710
monitored as to how you're being typed
how you're typing so that they know that

441
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:14,450
it's continuously you so that you didn't
log in and then handed PC over to

442
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:19,129
somebody else and let them complete your
test or something for you so they're all

443
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,599
these techniques that are coming out to
protect companies and individuals the

444
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,339
same time

445
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:43,279
well it's really hard to steal because
it's how you type so I can type like you

446
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:48,479
even if I tried I can narrow the
parameters such that no one would get

447
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:54,939
near you can make it so type that even
you could have a hard time reproducing

448
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,509
it you don't wanna make it that type but
you can you can vary so much and you can

449
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:04,769
make it we're not one word ITSM you type
a whole paragraph to use how you typed

450
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:09,339
in that age is the team's how much you
pause the angularity of that it's a

451
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:12,219
multi-dimensional space that's created
that's what they do

452
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:15,219
you're in trouble

453
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:48,910
circumstances there are fail-safe
mechanisms where you can login and you

454
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:54,709
know request you know a temporary
password and then would come back to you

455
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:58,569
with an email telling you something so
it you know there are ways that you can

456
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:02,400
get it in a temporary basis but if you
cut your finger off you may have to

457
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,259
reenter all right it's it's like with a
fingerprint if you lose you know if you

458
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:11,989
lose your fingers you can't read role
because you don't have your fingers left

459
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:20,940
it's it's a technique that we're going
to see more of because we're just the

460
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,459
overall biometrics is growing
tremendously ten years ago

461
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,209
you know if you to ask americans would
you be ok with having an Irish skin as

462
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:42,118
as a validation of who you are and the
people said no to invasive I was at CES

463
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,859
couple weeks ago and I was talking to
dbol the largest ATM manufacturer guess

464
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:54,119
what they're rolling out iris scan at
their ATMs and I asked that question and

465
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,430
they said we're doing it with I think
Citibank we have trials going on in New

466
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:04,890
York and I think some in LA and our
focus groups the people love it and I

467
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,879
said that's interesting that's a huge
shift in in the population attitudes in

468
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:18,170
10 years so I think as soon as we get
more and more accustomed to needing

469
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:25,479
security we're willing to do things that
we weren't years ago many years ago I

470
00:46:25,479 --> 00:46:30,939
worked for a company that made a
biometric sensor and after 911 their

471
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,099
company said are it's going to be an
every airport every access door in every

472
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,940
year put United States whether a
semiconductor company

473
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:44,220
and so I had a market lady come up with
her seventy thousand airport doors

474
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:49,970
70,000 access points in all the airports
in America so for semiconductor company

475
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:56,810
seventy thousand ships is about a week's
worth of work it's one batch two batches

476
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:02,690
it's not worth it to be in that business
today in this shows how broad

477
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:10,200
prognostications can be fourteen years
later I use biometric everyday a

478
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,990
fingerprint sensor when I go to my gym
not very secure but everybody said all

479
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:21,419
its gonna be in all these high secure
places no they were biometric sensors on

480
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:27,839
guns they've developed it they can't get
rid of it because it wasn't wasn't

481
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,420
effective I mean if I have a gun and I'm
trying to use it i dont wanna be

482
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,560
fumbling to try and get my my center to
to read my finger if anybody's use the

483
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,410
fingerprint sensor on your PC

484
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:48,690
how many views on your PC at work first
time every time I know if you didn't

485
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:54,310
enroll properly I had a swipe sensor on
an older PC and I enrolled in a little

486
00:47:54,310 --> 00:48:00,000
bit of a funny way I hadn't just like I
had to redo that funny way every time I

487
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,609
tried to log on and it was so
frustrating I i get out of it just use

488
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:09,089
the password so what i'm saying is we're
we're changing our attitudes towards

489
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:13,890
different things I don't know if that's
good or bad but we are changing so

490
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,900
really what we're trying to do is drive
a fundamental shift from proprietary to

491
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:25,369
open solutions not only what else is
doing but what my company is doing is to

492
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,369
make it open to make it low cost

493
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:33,089
so that we can have strong
authentication everywhere so the oath

494
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:37,700
reference architectures said is based on
open standards and it's available to

495
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,980
foster innovation and lower costs and
just some things if you wanted to find

496
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,180
out more

497
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:56,348
there's some websites are not listed
there were here is some other open

498
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:04,869
source implementations and hear the
references and the resources and I think

499
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:12,490
with that I'm done any questions yes

500
00:49:43,099 --> 00:50:13,400
because it is because you can take turns
and then all of a sudden you can say we

501
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,989
don't want him have access anymore

502
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:29,229
cut that off but right now they can't
reproduce it they can't just take it in

503
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:34,509
Canada and he played it's not open to a
replay attack has because what would

504
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:35,749
have you tried to use it

505
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:40,430
the bank is going to send say tell me
the cow jumped over the moon and so you

506
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,569
have to take into account jumped over
the moon so you won't be able to

507
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:46,569
reproduce that yeah

508
00:50:52,720 --> 00:51:07,379
valid point the continuous
authentication and the biometric

509
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,310
authentication from in a little you know
in a little but there's two separate

510
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:16,500
issues to separate items so you can you
can use behavioral biometrics to log in

511
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:24,210
the continuous authentication is is
something beyond that ok just having you

512
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:28,780
know I login doesn't mean they're going
to be doing continuous I don't I find

513
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,090
the continuous authentication other than
an e-learning environment to be

514
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,120
incredibly intrusive and I don't think
there's I think only thing the

515
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,730
applications for it is more like
e-learning when you doing more test

516
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:48,550
center or you know if if if you're in it
you know I sales mode where people

517
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,970
supposed to be making somebody phone
calls or by contacting so many people

518
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:56,189
per day or per hour so you can monitor
that effectively because they do that

519
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,060
today

520
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,560
you know but this is a better way for
them to do that I'm not saying it's good

521
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:07,020
it's it's a knife any other questions

522
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,250
super great thanks I guess this is the
last
