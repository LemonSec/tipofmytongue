1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:27,230
thanks her from an ear to listen to me I
miss her very much talk about sort of

2
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,529
Suffern scalability and testing testing
of in terms of volume but also some of

3
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:39,850
the blind spots that I see in terms of
what is security what is risk and we are

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,320
reviewing the whole thing and in a
little bit of us cute fashion so firstly

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,050
my name is owned carry the founder and
CTO at Sky which is sort of

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:57,019
vulnerability management service based
in Europe I was involved or asked say

7
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:06,100
twelve years in the global boarded up
until the end of 2014 ministry stuff so

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:15,320
application security or risk in general
we're almost this web application

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,100
security assault for security and they
go about people sort of default that

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:26,169
means websites but it's the open web
applications offer the ideal would allow

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,210
us to think about it is that nearly
everything is made a software so we've

12
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,500
all these sort of area sort of problem
with we are all these solutions will in

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,939
fact one problem the one problem is that
people giving hacks one problem is that

14
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,969
think this thing called risk which is
the chance of the likelihood of

15
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:49,439
something undesirable happening and we
have all of this market would just come

16
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,880
up with all these new things like you
know when I started this those steals a

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,210
storm started security was no such thing
as as dust either actually and I we have

18
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,179
done so I asked you may be right in
addition to that end we also have

19
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,359
availability assessment which is like a
host level scanning stuff like that as

20
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:16,920
well so we have separated the market
into number of different pieces but the

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,980
problem is just one singular problem of
of how delayed start getting hot

22
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,920
Headley develop and maintain system such
that I i'm at least

23
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,810
more strong than the other guy who's
healthy during our hearts in the air

24
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,910
wearing a bear some of the outage so if
you look at it then you know what is

25
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,359
where risk is an application securities
it holds security areas of both my view

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
is a hiker's don't give it a task if
you're one of those years in your

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,040
application or in your host level if you
look at a lot of the statistical studies

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,679
no reserve like it dries and reports of
the Cisco report that the ads can report

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,490
it's very much you see that a very high
majority of vulnerabilities found are

30
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,360
actually non developer related issues

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,790
alright so when we start to think about
that then we see that she has a

32
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,530
developer a lot of the vulnerabilities
in my system is probably in relation to

33
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,530
colder people wrote to me at all

34
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,240
we look at this point of your risks of
you know if any of these sort of levels

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,300
web applications frameworks and
components web web services server

36
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,350
services operating systems network
protocol port most the web application

37
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,960
studies in the last year and the CSL was
the biggest vulnerability white-hot one

38
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,250
or the edge down one of the argued the
Cisco on but as the cell isn't really if

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,110
you think about it its entirety allows
it isn't it isn't really an application

40
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,520
security thing is more like a sort of a
transport terminal for data I like you

41
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,180
know what we're starting to see is a lot
of the vulnerabilities were encountering

42
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,740
sort of us falling in between every two
stools if as well as security

43
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,570
professionals in Verona go look at what
software and web applications developers

44
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,120
which is the top player here you're
going to wind up with sort of huge so

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,370
technical depth below that lair

46
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,460
and also then we start to get into
components of frameworks in the facts

47
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,000
maybe eighty ninety percent of the cold
running on my application I didn't run

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,870
myself you start the considerable then
you know there's probably a huge waves

49
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,260
of potential issues they may have so
that things around component management

50
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,889
and I'm rather than having just patch
management which is a traditional power

51
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,229
windows or whatever patching we also
have to consider frameworks like struts

52
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:59,430
and springs and and all these types of
things which in effect also have another

53
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,389
day he spoke with Tom pouch and I want
two reasons we don't do that is because

54
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,080
it's harder cuz it still holds its not
retro it isn't retrofitted isn't there

55
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,930
portray well so we can just leave things
as they are so we were told application

56
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,660
security is the idea that we have
availability analysis application

57
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,990
security with Trent intelligence in and
played security and we have all these

58
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,570
silos and my view my personal view is
the market is driven this type of this

59
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,190
island approach was all these are
different products with different

60
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,099
companies selling their own solutions or
a trip intelligence solution versus a

61
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:40,750
you know an endpoint security solution
versus you know host vs application

62
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,780
there and to be honest if you're an
information security person like a maybe

63
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,940
a little bit more abstracted and
application security person you don't

64
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,599
really care how you know in some
respects have a hacker preacher system

65
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,240
you know you breached and you realize
you want to fix it but the thing is is

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
that it doesn't care if it's a web
application availability or buffer

67
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,389
overflow are known for her ability like
Stevie so I think we've made a fatal

68
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:18,410
error in some ways I'm it is market
forces the stuff but by place on the

69
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,750
side of Indy solutions and sort of -ism
lays maybe not being mutually exclusive

70
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,889
but certainly not being sort of

71
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:33,789
holistic as maybe they could be out into
the gutter pretty serious problem we

72
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,589
have in terms of trying to tackle the
problems of information security in the

73
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,499
first place

74
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:43,139
just a very cynical view of the world
from Family Guy which means we also

75
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,589
receive it in Ireland on TV as well
probably few seasons behind you guys but

76
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:52,020
the idea that you know what you're
concerned a day when you can treat them

77
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,808
for a long time make a lot of money lol
if you think about it a lot of sail

78
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:04,409
sales pitch and spin and snake oil etc
when people people maybe with a lot of

79
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:08,539
experience in the industry but say
people are looking for something to

80
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:13,110
secure my web they're sold the solution
and then it works sort of then they have

81
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,339
to hire somebody to sort of management
solution and then and then it works in

82
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,599
the wireless solution is the first the
boss doesn't fix everything and it's you

83
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,050
know it it sort of it's very like that
that's probably a very cynical view of

84
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,990
the world but it sort of that sort of
rings true to me anyway I just a lot of

85
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,020
these are just my opinions and i'm happy
for anybody to come at me and said

86
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,659
disagree with you

87
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:43,979
crowd cry foul because I think that
makes these types of things that we've

88
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,628
sort of the talks a great issue of
developers vs Security admin verse

89
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:53,899
developers of security versus am an hour
all they're doing our separate jobs but

90
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:58,289
in terms of again keeping hawkers
earlier systems they don't care who does

91
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,229
why they have this monolithic system
they just want to break into pollard at

92
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,339
our shoot you down wherever they want to
do a tacit Alliance whatever that may be

93
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:12,020
part of it it's a bit unfortunate but we
are seeing things move in the right

94
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,270
direction in some respects I love the
idea of convergence with you know

95
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,748
developers and security unit men are def
Cyclops and Emma DevOps is even more

96
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:28,529
strongly that def sucks offshore sector
adopts some people call it is sort of an

97
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:34,208
ill-defined I think still it's not as
well defined as as DevOps and things

98
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,208
would have offices in my view is that

99
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,610
security view the world is always a
little bit behind what's pushing ahead

100
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,950
in development but we need to reflect a
lot better so one of the things around

101
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,120
convergence is we don't do is is
application security host component and

102
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,330
framework security having this thing
called . we have guys that are sequel

103
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,070
injection cross-site scripting girls in
our grade out of misaligned everyone

104
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,160
that exists potentially in a system and
you know you're sitting there 10

105
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,760
scripts and 0 injection attacks but then
again so many walks in underneath your

106
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,970
back door commits a PHP known
vulnerability by downloading some script

107
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,330
from mill where something and all those
in there in any way but you didn't write

108
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,590
their coats will you be concerned if
there was a remote remote command

109
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,280
injection vulnerability in the version
structure using again I didn't write

110
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,600
that I wrote to call on top of that so
how is it developing mental list and our

111
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,760
problem identifying a fine just a web
security guy I am i hearing considering

112
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,050
all these components all these bits and
pieces that are actually using my views

113
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,390
were not enough we need to do more and
not worry too much of its sequel

114
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,689
injection cross-site scripting but look
at the other system as an overall i

115
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,900
think is the word so we've talked
earlier we have a bit of a divergence

116
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,540
right even though this could be blamed
for industry analysts as well and genres

117
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,410
put you in boxes boxes in your NASD and
application security sort of two

118
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,689
application security provider or you may
view vulnerability analysis which is

119
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,550
like you know like in essence cual
estaba thing right but the bottom line

120
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,250
is you know it's putting us in these
boxes in the helper problems you know

121
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,020
how we actually need to figure out how
to do this sort of a holistic way so

122
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,829
this is my view of our other market
driven separation of our industry versus

123
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,410
the risk isn't is a segregated in that
way risk is it

124
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,589
chance of something bad happening to
something maybe you own but our market

125
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,440
is driven it in sort of all these
various little bits and pieces so you

126
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,569
have all this other stuff as well do it
earlier you know 1998 study from IBM

127
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,819
dobson's or two earlier save lots of
money dude earlier you get here you find

128
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,959
twenty x better more of one of the
ladies will be cheaper and twenty years

129
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,430
later received the same crap right just
twenty years later still talk at twenty

130
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,209
years later we're still talking about
cross-site scripting twenty years later

131
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,638
before overflows in a little older than
me right that's old enough so if you

132
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,459
think about it there's an awful lot of
Larkin garbage energy industry and

133
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,628
people saying that there's this will fix
explains that but the thing is that

134
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,360
they're only talking the smaller pieces
solution as opposed to looking up from a

135
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,779
risk point of view looking at something
and in sort of a more whole wholesome

136
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,170
way of looking at all the layers if you
put it that way you know we also have

137
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:48,069
the idea of cases so we're producing Co
quicker with changing stuff quicker in

138
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:52,930
the dev up sense you know where our
systems are in a state of flux

139
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,239
constantly from the host from components
from pieces of our open source on the

140
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,889
client and objects or pulling into the
client from from the server and the idea

141
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,470
of you know very much what I julie is to
spread that so what we're doing is we

142
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,959
have points of failure probably more
points of failure so are failing off

143
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,180
them we're not putting all our money
into the sort of the the very end piece

144
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,550
right now putting all the money into
sort of the very last sort of you know

145
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,269
like if you have a horse race the very
last jump and hopefully we'll pass it

146
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:24,860
right

147
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,420
sort of spread betting it's a very
important but we need to do that more

148
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,779
and application security and security in
general you've heard all that before

149
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,360
but it is something that we need to do
but not do it only for web security

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,320
Institute for little or alot of our
aspects of your systems in general to

151
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
have idea of continuous integration
could use deployment has to continue

152
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,620
without you know everyone continuous
it's moving it's it's not we're not

153
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,209
waiting for things to happen you know at
the end anymore

154
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,138
were pushing new code every day how do
we track that has to be maintained a

155
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,009
hold of you actually get some clarity or
pushing code or not pushing

156
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,699
vulnerabilities RRR if you're doing a
really good job and start pushing code

157
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:14,500
and systems and deploying new systems in
general much as applications on a much

158
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,730
quicker way and it's loud environments
over what we know where we're we're

159
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,019
instantiate in you

160
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,970
new instances all the time or pulling
them down riding you services were

161
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,170
taking their part where you at all I'm
gonna we're we're breaking these into

162
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,219
into various services as well

163
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,190
the same time had we maintain that sort
of level diligence the level of rigor

164
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,779
when we're looking at it from a sort of
a security point of view so the idea to

165
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:46,220
use you as you know is it's keeping open
2000 meant it's the ideas is is very

166
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,329
much trying to catch books early and try
to try to match pound-for-pound were

167
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:55,000
developed as doing that hard is normally
better ten-to-one ratio between

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,940
developers and security people so it's
very hard to do that it's her but then

169
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,069
again if you look at it the old way
we'll be doing for years as we do a

170
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:08,199
two-week penetration tests on enterprise
is that so much to pay for internally in

171
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,709
terms of time are in terms of a
commercial agreement with a testing firm

172
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:18,660
and we're doing this guy are these
couple of guys two weeks to in effect

173
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,529
test 10 nine years of development work
doesn't make sense anyway you can't do

174
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:28,850
it we've been doing that for years has
two weeks ago and tests you know every

175
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,870
day to flow and every nuance and
everyday use case within this enterprise

176
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,560
application and you've got two weeks
four weeks you know the peres 1020 man

177
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,219
years have gone into building the system

178
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,460
the first place to work soon we talk
about the idea of our hosts and service

179
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,970
and frameworks and and sort of ok what
are they doing is something you'll find

180
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,270
you know when I started doing security
long long time ago there was saying

181
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,770
don't worry both client-side scripts
lines at security it's not that big of a

182
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,630
deal everything should be done in the
back end anyway and then we have the

183
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,480
idea of dawn crosses scripting came out
and I do you feel rich rich rich

184
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,770
nostalgia fly and so shall we can say
that anymore but i think is that we're

185
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,860
using all of these were of frameworks
and in effect if you think about it like

186
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,600
a novel proportions he mentioned it is
sort of not written by you

187
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,150
high proportion of people don't have any
way of monitoring component security at

188
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,430
all right so I'm then you know a lot of
people don't have an open source policy

189
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,400
so if you've developers and the lead
developer says let's use this plugin

190
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,430
it's pretty useful and ok works let's go
for it but it was like who who wrote

191
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,459
that how good is it is it secure a very
very commonly well use component but

192
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,090
that doesn't mean that hasn't got some
big big issues in Iraq so you know the

193
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,100
ideas that will you give you start
looking at it from a risk point of view

194
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,100
it's not just a cold you guys have
written it's the actual capone's using

195
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,800
as well to save you time and building
your system

196
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:15,130
examples of these will be you know as of
October 7 million downloads since the

197
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,900
vulnerability discovered and spring
streets 21 CVSS score tens pretty high

198
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,150
hundred and eighty $200,000 downloads of
that version of strokes even though they

199
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,189
are fresh and even though this
vulnerability was no one it doesn't

200
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,450
really mean though these are being used
in production systems is no way I can

201
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,480
have tracking down but we can say is is
what why why would you why would you

202
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,640
pull down a piece of code if you
actually can you that there was an issue

203
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,340
with it why would you even consider
deploying are using it because we don't

204
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,680
have

205
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,319
AV component management or component
securities so we're not sort of too

206
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,010
concerned

207
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,839
everybody's using its yellow thought it
should be fine let's focus on on on on a

208
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,430
contextual output encoding and
parameterizations to find out in our

209
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,349
inner circle injection and are in our
custody scripting and that's a good

210
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,919
thing but then again some of these for
example this remote command injection

211
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,510
vulnerability which it's there you
didn't do it but you can still get Roger

212
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:23,000
from from from the fact you know having
this enables the system so we every year

213
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,050
we have a horrible start supporters like
every other one its youngest

214
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:32,428
year-on-year doesn't change that much
but one of the things we did see the

215
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,620
sixty-three percent of all the
vulnerabilities were not really

216
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:42,580
developer related issues so so it's
obviously every is badass offer but I

217
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,139
want to developers direction using that
there were more like certain operating

218
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,910
system cev components miss configuration
issues that other thing so it wasn't

219
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,880
actually code wasn't always top 10 sort
of the top three things in that like

220
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:05,530
injection you know I cross the scripting
whatever actually I large portion of

221
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:12,820
issues can be removed by just simply
doing something like Eric attaching a

222
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,600
component management so it was a
conclusion then you could say well if

223
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,110
I'm not doing component vulnerability
management I am i doing up second I'll

224
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,439
just conveniently blocking that peace
out

225
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,429
2012 ignore that cuz it's such a pain in
the ass to tell you developers they have

226
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,059
to upgrade to version of spring and it's
actually not as simple as dropping in

227
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:34,559
you

228
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,149
jar file a war file into the server has
lots of retrofitting and deprecated

229
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,290
matters in all this type of stuff right
so it isn't a month saying this is easy

230
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,420
and then if you're not doing full stock
which is in my view is is the idea

231
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,530
around

232
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,480
host operating system you're poodles and
all the shell shocked solid stuff we had

233
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,110
last year across its grips your client
site security your javascript sharpening

234
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,629
coding and everything else in between if
not covering all about in some way or

235
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,340
are you do you know are you doing
security at all are you spoke see what

236
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,060
you think you're comfortable with the
hikers don't care what you're

237
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,450
comfortable in effect they want to do
something pretty tired of the tax if

238
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,900
they want to get in you know we've
already strong OPSEC team of use all

239
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,760
these cool tools yeah we're just gonna
come in here you know open already

240
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,770
people or to some stupid I know right so
how do we have to be sort of mileage

241
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,440
does so how do we have to fix it how do
we fix this problem how to even attempt

242
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,170
addresses some of experience we've had
true through the true effect of damaging

243
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,170
thousands of assets from for many many
years

244
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,420
gamblers work he would survive all teams
and teams are deployed poultry

245
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,220
frequently industries like retail and
gaming and those types of their tour

246
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,300
website are changing all the time as
opposed to financial services websites

247
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,720
without changes much change can give
rise to 222 bugs and bugs may give rise

248
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,270
to security issues so if you have
something that's changing about you may

249
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,800
actually find out there will be a lot
more of a little just sort of makes

250
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,149
sense so we can scale right first of all
we can do that we can scale in terms of

251
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:24,070
automation of the south of us essence we
can do depth coverage in patent rigor

252
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,290
and we can do all of those things we can
do them well I'm tools are very very

253
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,300
good at finding typical stuff tools
there are very good at finding cost

254
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,870
scripting issues in many cases during
all cases there are some nuances there

255
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,949
do you like they get the stuff like the
dumb stuff can be more difficult more

256
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,900
details but said in general even if we
got rid of all the traditional reflect

257
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,450
across its good thing issues you know
the ideas a tools can do they're pretty

258
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,280
pretty pretty easy

259
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,500
we can scale but only by virtue of
having automation so the Q me stuff like

260
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,950
adventure of a national organization so
as we check code in a continuous

261
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:07,280
integration environment as we check in
new code as we do certain events those

262
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,570
things in effects work will trigger
something like bill script which

263
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:19,179
triggers a number of cases so everything
from using Selenium to drive tools via

264
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,830
proxy sort of a purple lol sort of thing
to using sort of commercial-grade

265
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,679
solutions which are out there as well
and all those things can be hoping to

266
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,940
build services Jenkins Watson whatever
it may be

267
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,100
also in terms of automation we use these
things and we have people use them where

268
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,850
they built a relic chef important stuff
and the idea of being able to control

269
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,669
pills and automated ways of something
for sale of culture you can in effect on

270
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,750
either patch

271
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:55,330
very or moderately in the child spends
sounds we won't patch anymore and

272
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,439
throughout sense what we'll do is we'll
have an immutable instances baseline

273
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
instances would just rip the old one
down and rebuild and pushing you

274
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,520
USO concert to patching the travel thing
is it's not really putting bandaids

275
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,170
anything is actually just ripping the
whole thing off and sticking in the new

276
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:20,030
you know that sounds great you know has
been automation automation is very good

277
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:26,490
at detecting technical abilities so
misuse of code misuse you know

278
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,330
implementation issues coding books
things that that right which is pretty

279
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,240
much a lot of the stuff we talked about
on a day-to-day basis the top 10 stocks

280
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,490
after

281
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,950
animation is so good at this type of
story business logic our back door stuff

282
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,030
you know there are no idea how hard
coded passwords the stuffing out

283
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,450
sometimes particularly think gas would
be able to find a back door but if you

284
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,080
want the URL was in with the primary
value would be that would involve the

285
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,820
back door but if you don't know you can
test for it and also provide risk

286
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,760
measurement Kazuya most of these tools
will say every casa script is a high

287
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,230
risk in every sequence actions the high
risk in everything anything you know the

288
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,030
house of a sexy tree level is high risk
and you know you love rattle off when

289
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,740
you get into you go I what's the what's
the likelihood of of leveraging this

290
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,250
technical vulnerability against my
business what's the likelihood of this

291
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,289
actual issue being used against our
business in a real way finding

292
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:29,049
vulnerabilities in going from her
ability to exploit is actually not as

293
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:33,940
simple and many cases you might think
it's easy to find trusted scripting and

294
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,039
use it to show me to use it to steal
somebody's credentials to login take

295
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,450
over money that's what I want to see you
know so tools don't understand business

296
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,770
contacts are risk so so so generate they
just have a default value for a

297
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,720
particular vulnerability type of you
look at it that way then we start to

298
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,090
fall off a little bit in terms of
automation begin to storm still for

299
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,070
automation will be kind to everyone
automation this is like my view dollar

300
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:06,330
anybody likes the Beatles Yellow
Submarine goldblum mean he's in there

301
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,340
sort of pretty mean and blue and and
these guys in the facts you know sort of

302
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,039
the the sort of the gremlins in the
system

303
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,179
what 14 thought matters how do we want
one of those issues which prevent us

304
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,919
just showing automation that stuff where
where do we actually know where can we

305
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,130
meet you lots of good automation and get
a working and you know so I worked for

306
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,490
me things constantly changing be decoder
leases or or host environment changes

307
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,650
are our cloud changes whatever they may
be

308
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,830
versus where can we not do that so well
so the anti scale of my views things

309
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:47,949
like risk information versus data the
idea of having data doesn't mean it's

310
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,950
you it's in his defamation you know it's
only information it's useful

311
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:57,059
the idea around human decisions and
Intel so so so in certain cases against

312
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:02,309
itself it risked technical constraints
upstream compensating controls all

313
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:05,830
October stop automation isn't very good
at understanding of what we're here to

314
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,610
do is not find vulnerabilities were paid
to reduce risk for organizations were

315
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,719
not here to find crosses issues does not
your job it's good to find them and you

316
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,980
feel great about it to be the first
thing you've ever found your life you'll

317
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,830
remember that day was fun but i think is
is is that we're here to try and stop

318
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:30,030
people damaging our business or whatever
trying to protect so what is the anti

319
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,600
scale Minami do we have lots of new
types of languages now and all of them

320
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,570
are answering heavily tied strongly
typed which can be hard from things like

321
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:45,070
soft toss can understand what context
the primaries in API's and RESTful API

322
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,379
is one of the things that are you know
he's there isn't very many tools

323
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,150
actually do restful security very well
so if you want to scale you may need to

324
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,480
write your own one or you may to you
know you need to figure out what we

325
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,210
actually think about how to protect rest
for the API's I can actually be a little

326
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,390
more complicated than you initially
tired I would be around this is that we

327
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,809
hope to have if we are forever producing
code we're deploying our idea of having

328
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:18,070
a manual test for every time we
reproduce code we can't do that anymore

329
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,340
we can't scale so the IDS is manual
testing doomed and some in some respects

330
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,449
in the way that no your job won't be
defined hostage getting things anymore

331
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:33,669
your job in effect who's going to be 222
maybe focus on things like behavioral

332
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:38,590
logic and business logic has elected
automation get rid of like all the

333
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,980
technical abilities are easy found I i
think that sort of the what we're gonna

334
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,630
be doing anyway so how do we fight this
you know the idea would sort of holy

335
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,530
fighters anti scary scale but we have
problems will some things we need to do

336
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,908
is to rule churning

337
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:58,320
securing a duster South tool of putting
it into a pipeline to develop product to

338
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,689
piece of code over many iterations we
need to choose reaching the rules we

339
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,809
don't have failed bills soon as
developers will get upset which is they

340
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,759
rightfully so do as you're failing bills
based on false positives you won't be

341
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,999
very long and you're putting your job if
that happens enough we also need to

342
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:22,029
remove white noise just noise in general
being being sort of these you know all

343
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:26,090
of the tools to do it and we're all
compelled to do it is that's have so

344
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,459
many rules cause we have more rules and
the other guy and you know we have all

345
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,559
these two radical sort of issues and
these vulnerabilities artwork even

346
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,960
getting out of bed for a worrying about
their boots but they're tested further

347
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,619
by all of these tools is a mixed reports
the bigger etcetera and I just get rid

348
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:47,019
of those things as well and then the
idea what what what what time it is real

349
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:52,590
security real risk the risk of actually
getting clobbered forces best practice

350
00:27:52,590 --> 00:28:00,519
its best practice 22 I don't know you
know use a particular random number

351
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,359
generator to generate around a number ok
all ok let's fan of that Scotch but then

352
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,340
you realize why should the random number
generator is just 222 to determine how

353
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,029
many random seconds the next in your
banner will display so it's not an issue

354
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:22,029
so it's a sort of contact sure thing and
then we also have to those scales is the

355
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:26,849
idea of it would do when we test to test
everything every time or do we started

356
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:31,658
in some form of Delta analysis which is
the idea of of difference analysis over

357
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,679
time which is very very effective in
terms of scared

358
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,100
so its task analysis were on-time rates
good it's more than just chillin tho

359
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,610
sauces very much around the idea that we
have to the management lifecycle as

360
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,219
challenging when implementing south in
in a continuous integration environment

361
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,710
is the idea that real management and
shooting of false positives are very key

362
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,860
again what we want to do is avoid
failing bills we don't Jenkins to send

363
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,689
an email to the team needs saying that
the issues but because of a security

364
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,380
issue that actually doesn't exist and
also South trans cooler all the issues

365
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,789
raised its not good at certain things
these are some examples storage of

366
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:19,559
truman who sells a lot of them are a
logical or contextual so its data

367
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:24,789
storage and transmission of data but
doctors know it's confidential or not

368
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:31,940
you know logic it's quite obviously data
privacy and retentions 250 obviously

369
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,029
doesn't understand what the context of
the data is looking up or or those

370
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:40,140
problems are going into code

371
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,149
around this is you know this is sort of
uuuuu think they just sort of the flow

372
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:49,379
chart is put code in scanner Press red
button results come out

373
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,779
go and fix but then you start to build
it out you say what you can't do that we

374
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:59,250
we we have a continuous code being
developed we have a number of toll gates

375
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,510
are going to check in the cold here and
there were going to see if it's a

376
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:07,850
failure of possible if you know if it's
an issue you know if if we're going to

377
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:12,668
fix the code below 160 code if it's not
as if we're not going to fix the code is

378
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:15,659
either reason for her because you don't
have to get off risk or could be a false

379
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,130
positives and false positive need to
choose the rules are rules and removed a

380
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,230
false positive change the rule of it and
the running again

381
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,730
such that I don't over time you'll see
that you start you start to get these

382
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:33,200
false bill sales and such things right
so it's not just again pushing code into

383
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,690
a cell for your coat it's the management
overhead as well as is reasonably big

384
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,390
but it's not impossible and I actually
can we don't publish it two weeks

385
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:51,010
any any sort of the team we we've done
numerous times for 300 or so so as

386
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:57,110
development teams are using various
languages with gas reserves the margin

387
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:02,949
over taxes just talked to the coverage
gap with tasks of this is a test which

388
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,990
is not a PC can do in CI in terms of
scalable task primarily use it's a great

389
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,450
way to target assets it's in effect
Rivera testing you just gonna stand

390
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,870
something haunted the request and
hopefully will react in a weird way for

391
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:22,439
some of them are logical ones as well
right and then we also have another

392
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,190
piece of the puzzle which is
vulnerability assessment which is our

393
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,480
typical hosted host environment ahead we
maintain that if that's gonna change

394
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,610
over time so what what we find a word
with their second terms of doing this at

395
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,250
scale and volume and frequency is the
first assessment is generally going to

396
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,899
be a difficult one and then after that
subsequent assessments there will be

397
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:45,059
easier because we're going to use the
hotel's analysis in effect or consider

398
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:49,370
using that sort of ski camp start
comparing the current liabilities are

399
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,820
current findings with the most recent
last 10 heated up then you start only to

400
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,470
focus on difference which makes you
extremely scalable in terms of your

401
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:06,389
pipeline components security mentioned
this already but components security

402
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,449
like hoses very unpredictable because
you can't tell when the one of these

403
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:17,500
vulnerabilities will be discovered so it
requires sort of continuous you know

404
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,100
scanning and that type of thing

405
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,830
alright so when we get all this then we
need to do things like Delta metrics

406
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,620
what we're doing here is we're looking
at change and the reason because a few

407
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,689
reasons for doing these metrics are
really important to get probably heard

408
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:36,240
that already this last few days under
under Chris support for reasons for us

409
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,139
it's because we can start to to do
establish things that will cause of

410
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:44,840
establishing root cause we can establish
that it is availability is refining or

411
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,289
maybe patching issues ok we need to
figure that out

412
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:49,480
are they

413
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,500
are they more code based issues are KYTX
dockery funny a little funny sort of

414
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,080
maybe you know the code of the framework
what layer upper host and then you know

415
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,549
in the fact that start to fall men are
using is it sort of all PHP were finding

416
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,400
we're finding of very high level of of
course it's getting issues in PHP and

417
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,100
therefore we can sort of focus our
training and awareness on those issues

418
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,080
with those without development team and
so and so on and then you can start to

419
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,689
measure and improvement because if you
if you can't really improve what you

420
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,820
can't measure so very much

421
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,809
this type of thing is very very
important to an orgy right and you can

422
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:37,418
almost tools see eye to use integration
modules pipelines were you would

423
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:42,419
implement would you would be able to get
this type of thing he stuck it up over

424
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,940
time and in effect is hurting the very
good picture of all where r

425
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,750
availabilities a layer of common and
then in fact trying to figure out what

426
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,330
we need to do to try and may be pushed
out and prove that a little bit more

427
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:02,870
their thing around is around continuous
changes continuous asset profiling so

428
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:09,049
this is the idea that we're going to
constantly monitors having an asset

429
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,740
registry of your state ID seeing what we
do what we gotta do is we're going to

430
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:21,189
detect a change but this is like a
server passes it's very much looking at

431
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,379
ok how many live IP 0 er have how many
deadlines are new ones have a house is

432
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:30,100
the last time I looked here and we're
doing some sort of an ongoing basis what

433
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,960
services of change is only open for
awhile as so many deployed we find a

434
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,359
particular larger development outfits
that they may go to developers made

435
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,560
offers around but they made deploy maybe
despite a fall sport maybe the date they

436
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,119
deployed Ave environments I want the
public to testify on it and in the lead

437
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:56,740
matter and that in fact you know it's
there could be some non fit for purpose

438
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:00,509
coal in that environment which shouldn't
be sitting on the Internet

439
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,280
so in effect this idea is a second
attack changing given to and say well

440
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,260
she could attacks Road deployments being
exfiltration points for network stealing

441
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,040
data

442
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,920
advanced persistent rationale that
malarkey but bottom line it's not over

443
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,920
it's more for me it's more than just
saying what's changing in my external

444
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:28,110
environments on an ongoing basis and you
can couple hours well with all the other

445
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,350
stuff we looked around in terms of
metrics in a circular very very good

446
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,770
picture of what's going on you know in
terms of your terms of your overall the

447
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,759
digital state as opposed to sell the
idea of Delta now has emerged as already

448
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,590
but its the measure of change so what we
do when we do dealt in ours is we look

449
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,060
for clothes issues of these are issues
in effect that were there last time but

450
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:54,880
when we do the most recent assessment
are gone so that would flag design

451
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,790
issues in this change and you issue a
false-positive obviously we can't fall

452
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,090
like false negatives cuz we don't know
that there are two ways to me for saying

453
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,370
so in effect what we're talking about is
that all you need to do is focus on

454
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,440
clothes shoes to new issues to verify or
close to verify these it's actually a

455
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,430
new issue it's not any issues in FPV if
it's an FB we market on FB you know next

456
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,540
time you come back to it

457
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,450
our system has memory to say oh I know
this is not pete was verified verified

458
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:32,299
already and I know so don't waste the
the analyst time anymore and in doing

459
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,920
best and even though the Kobe 201
abilities you may hold you have only to

460
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,030
look at eight or nine under 45 of them
is all you're looking to change which is

461
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,270
is is it's pretty cool simple idea but
it's very very effective

462
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,189
around this is is is is is now in terms
of use integration is breaking the

463
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,120
testing two little pieces because that's
what our developers are doing anyway you

464
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,520
know implementing incremental testing vs
for aggression testing and the idea of

465
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,810
having early and often testing

466
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:08,130
having a continuous and also one of the
things you'll find as people say well as

467
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:14,540
discontinuous security testing I want to
do it every day in the duration of the

468
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:20,670
of the terror attacks to do tasks and
applications can take quite awhile to to

469
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:26,230
to cover off that is what defines that
the frequency of the test as well see

470
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,460
for you need to bear in mind if you're
doing commercial testing obviously your

471
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:37,980
frequency can increase much quicker as
well so what we can do very well as

472
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:44,700
Kerala just finish off is the idea that
you know behavior of testing can be

473
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,169
difficult I'd like to see the technical
security is is covered up by tools

474
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,010
technical securities found using
machines technical security being coding

475
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:00,450
errors and then I'd like to see our pen
test for fraternity focus more on

476
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,060
behavior and business testing that's
more what the juicy stuff is anyway in

477
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:10,470
my experience we have simulated stealing
a lot more money would business logic

478
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,589
issues that we have a crisis gripping
that's where the juicy stuff is not bad

479
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,490
better funds to keep your job industry
for a pen tester fine accosted scripting

480
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,379
for these five thousand time isn't it
doesn't show people that much anymore I

481
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:31,040
think yeah so you know I think it's just
it's something I'd like to see push

482
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,740
ahead I'm so we don't have to work
harder at Crossett scripting anymore cuz

483
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,790
you if you look at it you know it's
extremely boring so to this point most

484
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:46,529
people thinking to myself pushing
towards having a deluge in technical

485
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:52,980
matters push from tired of chasing top
10 issues to pay for logical flow using

486
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,060
the tooling and using the metrics and
the Delta analysis and all that stuff

487
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:02,750
and the full stock approach as I said
it's not as web security that's the

488
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,530
issue here in terms of risk in terms of
protect your business it's also the

489
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:12,420
stuff though their seven console fluxes
require constant assessment began if

490
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,599
you're doing it and you're on you're
doing some form of Delta novices

491
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,660
regression testing or whatever its chief
about you know we've gone that it works

492
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,950
and it's very very effective I think the
idea of having a point in time

493
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,029
contagion you come in and do a five-day
pen testing this out before it goes live

494
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:39,369
isn't really gonna last for much longer
I think businesses want security too

495
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:45,180
much the way she write the code so we
need to adapt to the waco has been

496
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,848
written and we are to a certain degree
but there's a lot of work to be done

497
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:53,779
that's pretty much all I'm gonna say
she's just in time for lunch anyways

498
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:59,880
sela yeah anybody any questions at all
for call of the day here

499
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:05,920
ok

500
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:07,359
your time
