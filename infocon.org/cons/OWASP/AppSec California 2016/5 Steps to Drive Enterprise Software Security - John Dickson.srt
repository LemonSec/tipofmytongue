1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:27,559
I welcome everybody two day two of
absolute Cali certainly the coolest then

2
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,019
you perhaps the coolest Absa conference
I've been to in a very long time and

3
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,159
just two hats off to the organisers I
know these these things are not easy to

4
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,159
put on a democrat of myself and a great
session so we're going together forty

5
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,239
minutes released in time for questions
and answers so the obligatory

6
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,370
introduction for those who don't know me
but in the application security business

7
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,190
for over a decade of that the first tab
sec

8
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,300
USA back in 2005 I spend most of my time
believe it not working with scissors and

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,560
CSO's who either have half started
absent programs are getting underway as

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,580
we I were recognized very early on that
as a somebody in this vendor space does

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,830
consulting if our clients are not
successfully obviously we're not going

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,220
to be successful either I've been in
this business for twenty plus years you

13
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,640
see the ESR force in learned Incident
Response Network defense in what used to

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,020
be called the Air Force cert in the
mid-nineties mostly what I do now is on

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,670
the business side lot of speaking in
writing and one of the cool things that

16
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,250
working with guys like Greg Reber a task
tech aspect folks barcode and others had

17
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,549
most recently been working on what's
called the open Sam benchmarking

18
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,340
initiative and that's to put data into
open Sam so that has been a focus of

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,789
mine really the last year and a half to
make that a more viable thing but I

20
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,250
would just tell you that the bulk of my
energy has been in

21
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,280
in helping organizations essentially
justify the business need for a sec and

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll talk a little bit about that for a
second so been in the business for a

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,860
very long time to get things started

24
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:13,560
was my first engagement AB sex circa
1972 only aunty school actually is my

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,870
first day of school I'm just hit me that
picture in it for those who can see the

26
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,959
back at the pinnochio lunch box so he
just goes to focus their bring that

27
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,040
undead they want to work apparently I
was focused / mad and first grade but

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,040
anyhow that has been my my effort but so
much in in a sec but it focus in general

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,870
so let's talk a little about the problem
that we have an appt sex talk about the

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,190
challenges we've got and then talk about
with this presentation is and what it

31
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,920
isn't the real problem that we have and
I think other speakers Jeremiah Wright

32
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,100
before this and others have it really
nailed this what we do is essentially

33
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,329
still viewed as discretionary within
many organizations what I mean by that

34
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:05,450
is a nice to do not have to do activity
outside the largest financials largest

35
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,810
banks largest retail folksy get it
outside US companies that had the

36
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,140
near-death or actual breach experiences
everybody else still has some level of

37
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,720
discretionary particularly around AB SEC
and I'm focusing a lot of energy right

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,310
now I'm riding around with a breach
fixation with this inordinate amount of

39
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,320
time spent around you know apt breaches
advanced you know the the attacks I

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,829
dread intelligence at the expense of
basic black blocking and tackling a nap

41
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,209
sex scandal that block and tackle
activity so the challenge we have is it

42
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,570
a lot of organizations will still
publish software will put out a new

43
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,040
builds and they can do so without
getting their teeth kicked in

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,070
initially ultimately they're gonna have
that problem but there's nobody that's

45
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,350
gonna force gun in hand

46
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,700
to do a last-minute tests so we'll talk
about that the challenges that recognize

47
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,920
and the other one that I would focus on
big time is the fact that there's a huge

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,880
incumbents been it's a term that I'd
like to use for those who don't know the

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,300
number of the gardener uses its not the
ground truth but it is a probably a

50
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,950
number is about a billion dollars nine
hundred million a year and a half sick

51
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,530
scanning that includes Wow apps that
includes everything around what we do

52
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,739
about a billion a year he said well
that's a lot of money in the spin in

53
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,450
point security seven billion I think it
is you look at the ideas market another

54
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:41,250
nine or ten billion AV I mean age he
hasn't gone away even though it's much

55
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,150
and discredit so the challenge we have
is we still you know ten years into a

56
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,109
sick are going in and trying to get
resources in many organizations on top

57
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,860
of the incumbents been that's already
been allocated is already constituency

58
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,040
and will be the person that says let's
let's let's take out antivirus in

59
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,850
exchange for the new application
security protections if that makes sense

60
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,900
so that's another challenge that most at
least at the leadership level in the CIO

61
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,289
and CISO organization you have this
really lack of discretion has been

62
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,420
counting the you s national deficit you
know so much of its already allocated

63
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,300
you really have a small fraction of
discretion so that's our starting point

64
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,560
for a challenge and what that means is
you might have the the orthodoxy of

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,200
absent down you may know exactly what
you want to do from a programmatic

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,229
standpoint you may have the right tools
right team the right practices in but if

67
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,750
you're getting a small amount of
resources at the expense of others are

68
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,220
simply not going to be successful and
that's the problem that I see over and

69
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,630
over again particularly in the lower
enterprise that what we call the upper

70
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,680
mid market world is everybody that's not
in the top eighty financial companies if

71
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,260
you get that everybody else all the rest
of guys were based in Texas so I say

72
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,159
everybody in the flyover state that's us
if you're talking to specifically the

73
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
oil and gas industry

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,100
this is nice to do stuff for them after
you know versus the wall street guys

75
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,260
who'd you can get this that makes it so
that is our challenges we've got this

76
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,920
incumbents been going we've got a really
really really at the core of it

77
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,700
a a function that some view as
discretionary that's a problem that we

78
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,330
have so the focus of this presentation
is going to be really about all the

79
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,490
things you do to push a program to get
more resources to be successful this is

80
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,530
not about SAS vs dads forces rat sources
I ask this is not about all the

81
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,309
different facets of technical discovery
skinny vs remediation all those aspects

82
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:54,770
there well covered in this particular
seminar and in week these two days what

83
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,330
I'm talking about again is how do you if
you're that poor guy that stuff with

84
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,370
building the program and rolling out the
program what do you do so what one might

85
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,530
keep us going in before I put this out
there was that most absurd programs many

86
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,179
if not most will fail before day one
that is the assumption what I mean is

87
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,080
you've not made the business case you've
not convince folks you do you have kind

88
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,050
of lukewarm support by the business
units the CIA oh so again you can have

89
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,990
the right tools team everything and
you're gonna fail because you get a

90
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,160
small bit of resources and go go go to
your stuff I I really don't know what

91
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,040
you doin understand it

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,830
part of the challenges in our space to
that most of the apps X function is in

93
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,750
the security organization most the times
and most people that can fix this stuff

94
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,610
or in a totally different organizations
to death for the business units right to

95
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,780
the riskless over here the people that
worried about the risk

96
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,419
live over here here's another truism
outside of this core group of true

97
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,729
believers if you go to most
organizations in the us- I would say 90%

98
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,770
of acts AB sick people where deputized
were drafted into that role from him or

99
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,080
network security background so right off
the bat

100
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,390
you are at a a mismatch on technical and
development background

101
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,659
and so you see over and over again you
know you bring vulnerabilities to the

102
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,430
the developers in all say that's not a
vulnerability that's a feature or that

103
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,000
so far that's a false that's a false
positive that's real that's you have a

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,549
difficult time have the discourse
because you can't go blow for blow on

105
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,219
the code for them support of the key
here is that we see over and over

106
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,420
Appalachian ski programs feeling before
they get on the field and I had a very

107
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,829
interesting discussion with the AT&T
person recently who said you know

108
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,620
they're very regulated market AT&T right
there

109
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,380
telecom they said that the quote was
it's not what we do on the field it's

110
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,220
what we do before we get on the field at
the regulatory bodies at the Public

111
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,750
Utilities Commission or the SEC I
thought it was very interesting I think

112
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,710
there's a metaphor here the thought is
you have to be much more delivered a

113
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,650
little bit more deep thinking before you
start to buy stuff or before you roll

114
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,180
out and hire people because most
programs fail on the stuff about the

115
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,290
talk about and not upon what scanning
technology but what did these selected

116
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:33,380
so let's get going ok so I had a five
step program five not twelve not 35 is

117
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,860
the number in the number is five because
I couldn't come up with sixty way but if

118
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,260
you have nominations for six to eight
years but what this really is is what I

119
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:51,110
call to use a soft return artifacts of
success one of the benefits of working

120
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,700
in space very very long time on the
underside is you get to see a huge

121
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,540
portfolio client see see how they do
their roll out these programs and we've

122
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,810
seen it all we've seen including teams
that have everything from dot net job to

123
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,209
BIOS development to you know that they
have just thousands of teams of

124
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,320
development teams what i'm talking bout
today are what I consider the artifacts

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,330
assist us that we've seen each and every
one of those to some degree or something

126
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,760
jump out of more than others and others
don't but I can tell you that there's a

127
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
few that if you don't do this you'll
fail

128
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,510
here's the other assumption going in I
mean some everybody's on an application

129
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:41,630
security team here you know TV size
typically 3255 7122 maybe for those no

130
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,580
we didn't build thread pics we have a
community version people download and we

131
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,410
ask that question how many people are on
here at SEC team and the average is 3 to

132
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:58,280
5 across all the beginner prices that is
325 forces thousands of developers to

133
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,720
the other something going on here is you
simply are never going to be able to

134
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,790
through force and coercion get the
development teams to do on your behalf

135
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,010
what they should already be doing you
just don't have strength in numbers you

136
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,819
have resources and absent of the big you
know the big banks you probably don't

137
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,070
have the ability to do that I'll talk
about how you want to characterize the

138
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,480
landscape that means have before you do
anything what you need a baseline again

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,730
these this is the prob perhaps the most
important step what you can do to secure

140
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,800
Champions as a as a conscious effort you
know this is not in any like SDLC

141
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,109
methodology but it is absolutely the
most key step we've seen definition

142
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,230
strategy and how you do that and then
executing the initiative and how you do

143
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,780
that it really and how you adapt and
then finally how you maintain at these

144
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,870
are five key steps that that I want to
jump into really quickly so first period

145
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,810
is characterized the landscape and I
probably disproportionate amount I'm on

146
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,500
this slide in on these these concerts
kids again the the precept here is one

147
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,440
of a little bit more forethought and you
want to be successful and you want to

148
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,390
share successes and communications this
is over and over into fashion so the

149
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,660
first thing you want to do is go through
these individually in the interest of

150
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,050
time is your compliance frameworks are
in the organization because as we know

151
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,160
it's easy

152
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,480
for development teams in business units
to allocate resources when they have to

153
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,459
write you have a a buyer who said I need
you to check this code and i just i just

154
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,339
found this out about two weeks ago
apparently in the oil and gas industry

155
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,480
there is a new security standard around
SCADA implementations so guess who's

156
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,329
pushing those be P

157
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:47,219
Exxon shell gets his listening in
Houston and rest of world everybody else

158
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,439
so that is a less of a compliance one
but its importance of private complaints

159
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:59,050
one analogous to PCI DSS so what the
point is it's not discretionary if you

160
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,589
have to do it then the business use

161
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:05,829
you don't have to convince them so
that's the first thing in in in the one

162
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,160
thing I would say specifically is again
think of the portfolio of teens you're

163
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,870
gonna have a handful of teams that have
to do certain things by compliance

164
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,860
regulation and the rest of teams don't
so quickly understand where and what the

165
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,069
what that compliance coverages

166
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:25,490
example we had a telco a client of ours
who initiated us to do an open Sam

167
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,060
assessment cool like a one-week open Sam
assessment for one dev team huge effort

168
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,810
which was probably over overkill to be
quite candid we get there and find out

169
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,630
the thirty-five other death teams in
that environment what about the other 35

170
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,399
deputies oh well we have to do this for
GSA that's the government and the

171
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,550
government's making us do that what
about the other 35 yet so that's that's

172
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,079
important because you want to get as
much coverage you can from things that

173
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,180
make people do stuff recognize the gaps
at that point and then also figure out

174
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,599
where it influences development
practices and how you handle data how

175
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,829
you handled at rest how you handle dat
in transit all that stuff that's a

176
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:07,180
starting point because you may know the
difference between compliance and

177
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,699
security but I bet you the business
units don't know if that makes it so

178
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:15,859
that's the first part first part knowing
that we're to invoke it the second thing

179
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:23,149
and I'm a big fan of cultural drivers
and congruence run culture obviously

180
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:27,019
Google is different from American
Express is different from Rackspace is

181
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,000
different from

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,050
VP and the starting point for
understanding how to implement these

183
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,819
things is is is knowing what those norms
are again I have ok an example in our

184
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,420
backyard there is a very large oil
services for who has safety is their

185
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,680
number one key cultural norms safety
because in Oil and Gas people die if

186
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,880
they do dumb things on oil rigs right so
that's a call their number one driver of

187
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,370
culture so they invoke safety and safety
of applications throughout the CLSI

188
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,680
everything goes back to safety if you
took that back to a bank safety would be

189
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,989
cares i mean but but they they evoke
that in in in in bring that down as a

190
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,050
required but that's true but also
understand that that that dev in the

191
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,699
dead teams could be very very different
and that they should be cultures that

192
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,390
are really tied to the development of
those teams are doing the guys that are

193
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,069
doing the dev team for that GSA example
I gave you may be very structure may be

194
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,589
kind of a more of a waterfall style
because that's what the government once

195
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,130
but the other team is doing mobile maybe
doing one week's prints and be doing

196
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,290
agile so you have to know where you're
going you know what you gonna do

197
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,660
security wise is that those those are
two different essentially different

198
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,980
entities complete different challenges
there so knowing the norms as an

199
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,490
important and the related to that is no
what s deal season place and I use the

200
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,150
term the plural and singular because in
most sophisticated organizations you see

201
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,900
everything under the Sun every method of
every approach know what languages

202
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,449
frameworks all that's important but also
know how they do it how they build it so

203
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:20,230
you know where to drop security
waypoints in so that is a No in the DLCs

204
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,210
knowing what they're what the drivers
are

205
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,889
culture wise you know if time-to-market
if your Netflix or at sea and

206
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,180
time-to-market trumps everything then
you have to build a scanner for lives

207
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,378
can mean that capture stuff before when
it's in production so the other thing I

208
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,790
notice on here is yet a deliberate
practice principal in the SDLC as you'll

209
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,920
see most of his that's developed out
there has some kind of it still see that

210
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,740
you're aware of when you get into more
ok arcane languages in closed systems or

211
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,660
BIOS driven stuff they're still a risk
and it still worrisome to the people

212
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,199
within the organization it's hard to
apply much of what we do which is very

213
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
much in its own right

214
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,339
open web application security project
writes a lot of the stuff that we do is

215
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,438
you have to do a translation layer for
the outliers but don't forget the

216
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,929
outliers because as we've noticed you
find a lot of risk in them as well

217
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,740
defined the artifacts of Sophos security
what that means there is a specifically

218
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,319
don't assume they've done nothing and
don't fit into doing everything just do

219
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,379
quick determined consultants gap
announces figure out the efficacy of the

220
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,700
effectiveness of that but also
understand what prompted that bye in the

221
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,690
first place

222
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,950
did you may get to make it to understand
what's driving their own paranoid if a

223
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,370
body application scanner are got one of
the SAS providers are did training two

224
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,070
years ago what was the trigger of it was
the rationale for doing that I'll tell

225
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,700
you what drives their perceived risk is
it on going to fail

226
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,159
was a one off all those things are
important because when you go back you

227
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,049
may have a bigger hurdle with a
particular team if you find out that we

228
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:11,110
tried to two years ago and it blew up in
my face and Bill got fire ok when you

229
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,740
look in the hundred teams one of the
things you're gonna have to do is figure

230
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,470
out where you get the most coverage in a
short span of time right you got five

231
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,809
people are 12 or 3 against three
thousand so one of the things we

232
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,460
recommend is if you do find when these
teams as you pivot offer that say look

233
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,690
we know those guys are great but we're
gonna make more we have more coverage

234
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,789
and more gain more ground with these
other teams because they're receptive

235
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,779
and they got the right people in place
was packed with all these things

236
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:37,770
catalog that

237
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,820
you'd be amazed I would save most of the
clients we work with vast majority don't

238
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,399
do this they just start you know we're
gonna build a house let's go to Home

239
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,130
Depot and throw stuff in the back of the
cards are built in stuff you know

240
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,830
running running this is very important
to be delivered and find out what's

241
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,030
already happened also learn the hard way
you know you'll spend on stuff you don't

242
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,910
need ok recognize the gap between policy
and practice is really should be safe

243
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,030
practice look at the gap between what
they say they're doing and what they're

244
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,120
doing

245
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,040
I do those gaps at this point you start
to need to communicate and socialize

246
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,470
both upward and outward both the teams
what you found if you are a

247
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,100
sophisticated organization person you're
gonna paint this is negative a picture

248
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,129
possible to some degree she can say this
is how I got it and then this is what

249
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,550
were the improvement that we tried to do
some of their something there that too

250
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,580
but you really need to let and quantify
the risk for you know the folks they

251
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,500
don't know that they'd simply don't know
and don't get beat up by this so don't

252
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,480
assume that stuff is happening and don't
assume that that was happening is

253
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,620
effective but there may be pockets of
excellence you may have team that you

254
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,959
look and say she does guys actually
pretty well they got it down they have

255
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,440
we had a client who had a definite you
came from visa got them yet the the

256
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,290
religion of these airdropped into this
client so that whole team got it just

257
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,950
because of that presence of one person
so that's important to know if you can

258
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,910
simply spend limited time in other teams
you say bills got it there let me work

259
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,490
on Team ab&c as bill I think bill gets
it so why the bills in the world are

260
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,230
important bills and bills and others are
not sexist is I would say the most

261
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,040
important thing this is where I see if
you don't do this party will fail and

262
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,570
that is secure Champions I think Brad
Arkin and the guys Adobe have done the

263
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,220
most public version of that in the form
of their ninja program but this is a

264
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,180
conscious cultivation of relationships
for essentially volunteers within the

265
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,510
dev teams and so we're this is because
again you get twelve or five or seven

266
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,570
they've got three thousand you simply
are not going to ever be invited to all

267
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,480
those meetings they're not going to
think about it when you're not there

268
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,169
room is somebody in the team sa way I
mean this is a new function I heard

269
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,740
about threat modeling from Brooke get
some confidence level we get up in

270
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,340
understand how we handle this data at
rest over here so how you do that this

271
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,899
is a conscious effort the most
sophisticated I've seen spend money in a

272
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,750
little bit of money

273
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,780
pizzas and giveaways and bribery but
what they do is essentially do a lunch

274
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,750
and learn all the equipment lunch and
learns of some kind of roll out because

275
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,360
what we found is within every one of
those dead teamsters one person that one

276
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,760
or two classes in their CSI
undergraduate that like get this topic

277
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,960
in here's a big point almost an everyday
if team there is a desire for

278
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,960
differentiation between the developers
usually the dev team there's a person

279
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,470
that wants to be known as the UX UI
persons a person that's the web services

280
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,290
what person there's always an
opportunity within every depth even to

281
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:52,799
deputise a security person and formalize
that and give him a stakeholder role to

282
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,500
do on your behalf but you can't do
because you never in the room so that

283
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,440
that conscious effort to reach out fine
with those people who they are whether

284
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,540
at a program on my eyes out so you can
essentially communicate that to them

285
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,500
they get rewarded for this in their
business performance assessments hey in

286
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,860
addition to do all their stuff of their
the the group security guru still see

287
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,110
security guru you know the other thing
with security secure Champions you may

288
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,428
again for the compliance driven
organizations you may invoke the the

289
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,799
internal audit folks I i've i've seen
organizations where if internal audit

290
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,230
says it I believe it that settles it so
maybe your first trip is the turtle

291
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,520
internal audit get them to do an audit
opinion you walk around and say hey I'm

292
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,389
not saying you need to do this they're
saying you need to do this I'm just

293
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,220
communicating this to you so you know
it's consciously cultivating allies

294
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,990
proxies very important there's different
ways to do that but this is really an

295
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,330
not articulated in most of the
literature that we've that we cover ok

296
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,850
so you've got this

297
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,389
framework established some context for
what you're gonna do you have some

298
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,650
allies are out there the next thing to
do is to find strategies and standards

299
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,820
in in a very lightweight way when it's a
standard that's homes you know his

300
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,659
mistresses I said keep it real simple
really easy real simple and again you're

301
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,340
trying to do the the most with the least
and you've got seven people are 12 or

302
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,379
three or four whatever so apply the most
amount of resources on the scary saps

303
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,930
that's that's one thing that i've seen
in Provo half the organization's is they

304
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,930
don't even have a full risk ranking list
of their applications I would say at

305
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,950
least in the upper mid market that's the
thirty billion dollar 25 billion dollar

306
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,850
companies most of them don't have a
comprehensive list so if you're gonna

307
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,530
start hurtling down the highway maybe
getting that rank Roo that risk ranking

308
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:57,320
list done will help you justify what you
doing assessments for the biggest and

309
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,600
most critical apps will help further
justify resource allocation so

310
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,659
throughout this process I say it I mean
what you're trying to do is show

311
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,490
victories and then continued get
continued you know resources

312
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:16,560
absent of some type of application
breach then you start to defined

313
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,770
standards for future improvement and i
was just point to one in the interest of

314
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,910
time and reference that I love the the
brevity strategy of saying look we're

315
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,270
just in a defined 10 things that our
organization hold to be true well to be

316
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:37,310
self-evident and you know how we handle
data how we handle mobile applications

317
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,440
we how we handle web services how we
have you know a handful of things this

318
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,080
is what we do we check all of our mobile
applications for security flaws before

319
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,250
we publish them on an app store we
handle logins a particular way we don't

320
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,610
let our development team rolled their
own if you can do this and put this in

321
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:01,580
terms of developers and have this on a
three-by-five or worse yet if I seven

322
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:09,550
card you might have had more impact than
any that of orthodoxy that you know to

323
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,100
be true

324
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,678
it becomes real and they start to do it
they start to get back to you implement

325
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,770
threat modeling on the most high level
and most most critical applications

326
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,910
we've set the 23 sessions here i mean
this is the US have some high priests of

327
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,570
modeling if you can at least get the
organization say well maybe we need to

328
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,020
call the absolute organization to get
them to do a threat model consulting

329
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,770
into the business that's a victory but
define standards and I keep a modest

330
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:46,059
show wins and and again no recognizing
that you've got all the types of

331
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:51,690
development frameworks language in such
tried to apply you know the the Pareto

332
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,400
Principle throughout ok so executive
initiative in parodied in Champions

333
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,580
calling them leverage them you know
communications via blogs and internal

334
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,600
medium is important the irony of all
this I mean I mean how many people here

335
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,860
besides the obvious sales and marketing
staff here will consider themselves

336
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:20,840
sales and marketing professionals again
I got bad news like if you the study in

337
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,668
your one of the five or seven or 12 and
you've got three thousand people to

338
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:28,450
convince to do something different that
they're not giving their butts kicked

339
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,200
you you are actually a sales and
marketing professional you just don't

340
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,690
know it and that's the challenge we have
here is you gotta do the Jedi mind trick

341
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,159
and you gotta get these people to do
this stuff again on your behalf for

342
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,150
something that their business units not
kick in the teeth to do right

343
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,400
ok so yeah communicate Taylor this the
audience start to capture metrics has

344
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,230
been a lot of metric talk here

345
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:59,539
pick one metric whatever that is you
know bugs per line I did suffer security

346
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:04,780
defects per line of code meantime to
remediate pick one in due to depict in

347
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:10,059
pick one initially and again highlight
positive behaviors 'cause one thing I've

348
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:15,520
learned in my limited time in this world
is it software developers don't like to

349
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,090
suck right and they don't like to say
compared to their peers so you don't

350
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,169
wanna shame others some organizations
that

351
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,340
Yoshimi works but what I like is when
you highlight the positive behaviors you

352
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,030
say look at these guys on this team did
it and suddenly the debt managers like

353
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,990
wait a second

354
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,390
we don't want to be the team that sucks
so let's go in the survey also

355
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,210
reinforcing positive behaviour around a
software development get them to start

356
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,260
to do this ultimately will we see
success is when the onus of this

357
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,660
activity lives in the development
organizations and not in the security

358
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,890
organization I simply don't think we're
there yet by a long shot

359
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:01,620
execute the initiative and then sustain
the program monitor iterate monitor the

360
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,199
regulatory environment and technology
environment who's the other thing any

361
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,460
PCI as an example they have a new DSS
that comes out there's a new attack

362
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,610
servers new applications mobile changes
you know suddenly found its sales

363
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,229
organization move their entire CRM to
the cloud without telling you ok that's

364
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,520
part of the attack surface potentially
so this is the other thing is you you

365
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,510
really really got it there's no there's
no point here this is one of iteration

366
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,790
but I think most organizations are still
trying to get everything under under

367
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,510
coverage so I'm gonna wrap up so we have
time for questions and answers but i

368
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:42,600
just i just in a couple of thoughts you
know the key term is sustained

369
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,129
sustainment and focus and iteration take
the long view to use a Chinese term this

370
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,090
is something that's intake multi years
maybe a multi-generation I i mean Jeff

371
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,399
Williams myself dominicano

372
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:05,130
Jeremiah do this for 10 years plus and
we see improvements organizations and we

373
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,410
see others are still struggling so we've
got a lot of work to do and this is one

374
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,940
way that I think some of these concepts
here can be adapted and put to work to

375
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,580
make you more successful and with that
we've got time for at least a couple

376
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,580
questions

377
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,620
preferably the former true false it's
there

378
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:44,610
yeah that's a great question this is
this is from my marketing team who

379
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:51,479
watches this later I did a study two
years in a row for Absa Kusa in 2013 14

380
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,690
about the effectiveness of training on
its ability to write security code we

381
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,220
suspended that study for one reason it
took a huge amount of resources in time

382
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,789
but we came out of it I can talk to you
later is it does in fact have an

383
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:11,529
improvement is about 25 percent bump so
if the most developers if 70 is passing

384
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:18,369
70% most developers around 60% on first
black so it doesn't prove them but what

385
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:23,639
we found is most developers will go
gravity back to the way they develop the

386
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:24,299
first place

387
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,740
absent of SDLC changes rather
reinforcements which makes sense so that

388
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,889
it so if you have an organization that
does training and then does know SDLC

389
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:37,729
changes are no reinforcements are other
thing they will gravitate back to weigh

390
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,330
the way they did it the other day to
remember what training is the turnover

391
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,769
the dead world is about 25 or 30 percent
a year depending on the organization and

392
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:50,919
sector so whatever organization you
trained in 2012 or 13 is not the same

393
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,480
organization you have right now so there
has to be a way to do the intake the the

394
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,110
new hires there has to be a way to do it
and in a knot heavyweight fashion so I

395
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,580
can get me afterwards it's it's a topic
of passion but one that I think the

396
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,549
results are not I'll just say the other
absence of training is bad but if you

397
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,860
think a knapsack program is to change
everybody that's that's obviously not

398
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:24,869
that either so we had another question
up front all right in the back Jason

399
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:31,879
Hiser give you might have to give you
the mic other ways I can hear otherwise

400
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:33,959
idea came here

401
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,440
thanks john as someone who's been in the
industry for a long time

402
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,929
web applications are essentially
communicated and and access through the

403
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:46,820
web

404
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,320
there's going to be more web
applications in you know if we're

405
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,860
talking about all this I ot stuff you
know it's going to connect to a lot of

406
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,199
really critical devices in the future

407
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,520
that's also going to use web
applications taking into the inherent

408
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,600
irony of the internet which is that you
have to leave it as open as possible but

409
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,408
we can invite a lot of bad guys I mean
what what is kind of your Longview

410
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:15,850
forward for how we can better securities
web applications as I get used more and

411
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,250
more

412
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,770
ok thanks for the easy question the
record I think they're going to

413
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,820
continually be new technologies that
will make it harder for developers to

414
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,720
make problem

415
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,480
you know the the memory management in
Java and.net sit good example they're

416
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,289
promising technologies when Rasmus some
of the automation that's happening

417
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,570
around formerly management i think is
pretty cool that take stuff less out of

418
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,460
their hands but I think what's going to
happen is you have less and less well

419
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,520
Jim I may differ but you'll see less of
the coating flaws you're going to see

420
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,408
more of the architectural Falls where
people don't even ask the question and I

421
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:00,090
get to see sammy's presentation
yesterday on the car acting cars and i

422
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,539
mean the the point that he was making i
I absolutely agree the people at these

423
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:08,559
large companies are not even asking the
question right they don't even have a

424
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,039
security staff to talk to to report a
bug bit of a bug downing so what I worry

425
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,158
about with IOT is an example or the
Maytag the world you know the the

426
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:24,919
Kenmore that people do dryers and
blenders you know they're they're

427
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,130
leaning forward to get this capability
but they don't even have a person s

428
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,110
question way to say you know

429
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:37,010
is that good and so that's what worries
me as we secure kind of the classic dot

430
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,429
net Java dev world anymore repeatable
fashion you're right the world changes

431
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:46,929
and suddenly we're trying to have to
convince a new set of people about the

432
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,730
importance of this so the good news is I
think everybody in this room and by

433
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:56,690
extension everybody in our field we have
jobs forever and every day and you'll be

434
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:03,549
in demand as as the different recruiters
are so I would say you know my one last

435
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:11,190
party thought as a great question is i'm
looking now to folk is some energy

436
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:18,668
around visibility in voluntary
disclosures to to enhance behaviour of

437
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:22,520
Amex instead we're going to make it
easier for the meat eggs and can mores

438
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,840
of the world to to make the asked the
question and I was in a talk about this

439
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,320
little bit lost scene right blossoms the
middle floor and we all know in should

440
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,960
flaws right but we kinda don't read a
book right now the talks about that

441
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,960
brushing the teeth brushing teeth in the
early nineteen hundred's was a new thing

442
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,850
if you go back to the eighteen eighties
nineteen nineties in this country in

443
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,250
most countries but she didn't happen a
recurring basis so people's teeth fell

444
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:55,510
out so behavior changed our youth pastor
for a ticket hundred-plus years I'm not

445
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,230
sure how quickly this is gonna change
but I do think we need to change

446
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,080
behaviour have more encinas they're
gonna be more spectacular breaches and

447
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,790
we've got a lot of work to do so with
that party note I appreciate your time

448
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,130
I'll be around if you have any further
questions thank you
