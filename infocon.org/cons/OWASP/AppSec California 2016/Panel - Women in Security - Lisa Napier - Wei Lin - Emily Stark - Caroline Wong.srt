1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,710
I'd like to introduce my panel and I
will ask you to them to introduce

2
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,300
themselves more but we have all the way
over there Caroline Wang from Siddle we

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,559
have whalen from Symantec and we have
Emily stark from Google

4
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,449
and i'm lisa Napier so I'd like to ask
everybody to Caroline if you can

5
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:50,280
introduce yourself more thoroughly and
tell us how you got into security place

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,820
I'd be happy to do that

7
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,059
my name is Caroline 1 I'm currently a
director and sagittal which is a tougher

8
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,739
security consulting firm and I've been
doing security stuff for like 10 years

9
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,410
now I started out leading information
security teams at eBay and its before

10
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,440
transferring to what I jokingly referred
to as the dark side when I started

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,960
working for semantic in the vendor
community and then started doing

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,970
consulting its digital two and a half
years ago and I got into security in

13
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,009
sort of a random way I had studied
electrical engineering and computer

14
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,470
science at UC Berkeley and between my
junior and senior year

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,810
applied to any internship that then I
was qualified for ended up doing

16
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,939
an internship at eBay and I T project
management loved it and then upon

17
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:43,889
graduation said I'd like to work full
time and my intern boss said well I T

18
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,720
has a hiring freeze but there are these
entry level positions available and

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,710
information security and I said I don't
know anything about that and he said

20
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,729
that's ok you know they're just looking
for a smart college kids to train and so

21
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,149
the night before my interview I went and
I memorized the Wikipedia page on

22
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,270
information security and and that was
all I had going in but but they were

23
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,519
right you know they were they were just
kinda looking for someone to train up

24
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:13,480
and and the other thing about that
interview was there were four people the

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,260
hiring manager was the last person and
so they'd ask me these questions and

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,319
then they kind of like tell me the
answer so by the time the important

27
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,238
person was asking questions I was
repaired and then I just found out that

28
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,810
I liked it so here we are very
fascinating experience in their history

29
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:41,019
so I'm where I have been working for
semantic 415 a half years so how did I

30
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:48,920
get into security before cementing I
work in aerospace in Canada much are

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,390
very cold and at that time was dot-com
era and most of my friends they are

32
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,608
moved to the you s ok I will try my
chance in Aus

33
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:10,760
job then this to head hunter family say
he helped us I think so I look at that

34
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,380
time will go on in that famous so we
then use the word Google thought I'd

35
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,380
look that up in Internet and the popular
iPad

36
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:25,569
cement a crisis not semantics interested
so they they realized right away I typed

37
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,530
the wrong name instead fyi

38
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:41,290
and SEMA and PC so this is the right
username ok internet security and now

39
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,609
we're in that calm and another web Singh
seems very interesting I said ok I will

40
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:56,030
try so I came to add that to my office
in the northern branch in March so that

41
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:40,780
was all white and manager will be the
manager for not so I star real manager

42
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,659
job in Norton first then we'll want to
the security solution for not important

43
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,660
and the Sigma enterprise security
product then moved back again leading

44
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:00,030
not in product development at six years
ago I was appointed to start and not a

45
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,450
mobile security product development so
over the year to all around security but

46
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,159
ironically last year took a new job is
no longer I'm no longer on the security

47
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,010
of poor side but I'm leading engineering
team for the knot

48
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:23,700
business basically when the east and I
have been on the Google Chrome security

49
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:33,920
team for one year and one day I got into
security when I was an undergrad at

50
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,140
Stanford and I was doing some research
program in computer science

51
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,630
the summer after my freshman year and I
was doing research in an area of

52
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,190
computer science that wasn't really
doing it for me and so I decided to go

53
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,060
find some other type of research that I
wanted to do and so I walked into

54
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,940
D'Antoni's office having no idea who he
was not you know if you don't know who

55
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,780
did bernie is he's like a very famous
photographer I would have been far too

56
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,950
intimidated to talk to you if I had
known that at the time so I walked into

57
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,740
his office and asked him to give me a
research project and he did and I worked

58
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,710
with him for undergrad and found that I
liked that field a lot so I decided to

59
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,919
stay in a very good thank you

60
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,830
i'm lisa Napier and I have perhaps the
oddest I fell backwards into security I

61
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:40,859
started off as an art major and decided
to get work as a computer trainer

62
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,940
because I like computers that ended up
tripping the stumbling into database

63
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,820
documentation database programming
programming tech support and with a

64
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,790
company that ended up getting acquired
by Cisco and found that I loved the

65
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:05,050
networking concept and just although
findings were doing and my company that

66
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,700
was the acquisition was

67
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,659
Cisco at that point was later three and
below and we were there for up to the

68
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:23,460
political heir for those of you that
joke and the with that expertise in all

69
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,919
of the layers of the stack that
translated into focusing on a lot of

70
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,140
security products at the time that were
at the network layer so firewalls and

71
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:40,520
things like that that my team became
experts out and that was how I stumbled

72
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,590
into security worked to set up Cisco's
incident response team for their

73
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,710
products security side and have been
doing products security related tasks

74
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,169
since then and so it's you know some of
the best mistakes that I've ever made in

75
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,260
stumbling backwards into security and
that was how I got into it not a plan

76
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:09,500
see so we're here talking about some of
the challenges that you know our

77
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:17,290
industry is very male oriented and male
dominated and i'd like to ask our panel

78
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,760
some of those what why do you guys have
any ideas on why you think that is

79
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:35,299
ok so I think on this so that I T
industries software industry is

80
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:42,679
traditionally male dominant like most of
engineering field and over the years

81
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:48,819
I've been involved in many of these
women initiative in IDR INPEX sector we

82
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,310
have discussed a lot about this why that
is a little look at it just the whole

83
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:01,819
population and we look back if we were
say the male dominant industry has been

84
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,430
tradition you know what has changed
right and look at the pipeline look at

85
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:16,329
where we can find the source that's
showing some very discouraged in 1985

86
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:28,200
female population and 35% off computer
science and acquired degree in 2011 and

87
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:37,410
then went down to a 17 percent not very
encouraging and also if you go back look

88
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:44,400
had we have less female student in CAS
so that also just feed industry with

89
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,850
less population ok so the situation has
not being creator has going to the wrong

90
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:57,480
direction so I think that ass question
you know many organizations have been

91
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,490
working so how we came we saw pipe I we
can talk this little bit later yeah I

92
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,700
think you know from my perspective I
think it's really an exposure thank you

93
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,029
know for young girls as young girl I
wanted to grow up and be a draft and

94
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,410
then I wanted to grow up and be a rock
star and as I grew up you know the

95
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,370
people that I knew where teachers my
father was an attorney so I was like I

96
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,779
want to be a teacher I wanna be an
attorney I didn't know any information

97
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,200
security professionals and I certainly
didn't know about their salaries or

98
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,600
about their lifestyles you know perhaps
when I was 5 years old

99
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,100
my job didn't really exist at that time
so I couldn't aspire to to say that was

100
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,459
something I wanted to do today my job my
love my job and and and my lifestyle

101
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,180
because of my job is awesome I'm a
consultant I work from home you know

102
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,998
fifty percent of the time I've got a
ten-month-old daughter in working from

103
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:54,300
home is great because I get to be with
her a lot and then I get to travel and I

104
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,420
get so come to stuff like this and I get
to go to exotic locales you know when

105
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,019
fly business class and its this really
sweet life but I didn't know as a

106
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,439
five-year-old girl as a ten year old
girls are fifteen year old girl that

107
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:10,809
this was that this was like an option
for me because I i wasn't exposed to it

108
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:20,180
and everything that I want to mention
relating to the pipeline is it's

109
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,498
certainly true true that the pipeline is
a problem that you know there is just

110
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:32,139
not enough women coming into this field
but there are also a lot of striking

111
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,879
statistics about how the final paper if
ads you go from individual contributors

112
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:43,360
to managers to executives and so it's
the pipeline is certainly a problem

113
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:52,110
there is also a problem of losing women
at every stage and so I think it has to

114
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,579
be the fix has to an effort that that
focuses on on all stages of that final

115
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:03,399
which doesn't really answer your
question at all but it's no it actually

116
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,699
leads into one of the other questions on
there but you know what are some of the

117
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:13,569
reasons that women now this is a bit
unfair because you you women are clearly

118
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:19,920
in TAC we all are and you know the but
why are some of the reasons that what

119
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,089
are some of the reasons for the
attrition of women dropping out of tech

120
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,459
you know are that the final issue

121
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,639
you know ironically where we're like the
wrong people that ask trade you know I'm

122
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,829
sitting here next way and she is an
executive at Symantec which is like one

123
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,339
of the biggest security firms in the
world but it's interesting you know we

124
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,290
could think about female colleagues that
we've known you know at different at

125
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,469
different points in our careers and
think about you know there's so many so

126
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,949
many individual reasons for it

127
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:01,339
perhaps why not throw people that asked
which is the kind of a good thing I can

128
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,570
say that I know what I am still intact I
have thought about dropping attack many

129
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:13,410
times and have felt many times like i
cant do this I'm done gotta go like I

130
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,189
don't do something else I don't know
what it would be but the times that I

131
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,440
have thought about doing something else
it's it's mostly like you know there's a

132
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,389
feeling of exhaustion I think hopefully
a lot of people can resonate with you

133
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,640
know i think is a field that that
attracts really smart people and so the

134
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,519
competition is really tough it's it's a
very intense field to be in the demands

135
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,010
are higher

136
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:49,490
fantastic lifestyle but it's also
demanding one and that it's exhausting

137
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,290
and I don't know if that's specific to
being under represented except that I

138
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,760
think there is an additional degree of
exhaustion from just feeling different

139
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,209
all the time like you know when you're
the when you are sitting at a table

140
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,459
surrounded by people who are very
different from you there is this feeling

141
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:12,319
of like managing your the way you come
across 5th thinking just like stressing

142
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,240
about how you're representing your
gender or how your

143
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,230
how how people are perceiving you
whether you are whether you're

144
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,170
struggling against some kind of bias I
think that additional stress contributes

145
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:33,870
to a kind of fatigue can settle on
people people in this industry talk a

146
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,260
lot about burnout and I don't think that
is something that people under age in

147
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,990
other industries experienced quite as
universally that's that's a really good

148
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,440
point there was a wonderful movie that's
been out cold code and it's about girls

149
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,399
in technology and one of the study's
that they cited in that I just found

150
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:03,450
fascinating is they studied under grades
in math just in terms of how women do in

151
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,820
math and the study was fascinating in
terms of addressing that specific

152
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:20,970
fatigue what they with the concluded was
that women in situations in certain

153
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:30,990
situations have a a sense of women were
representing this whole group and that

154
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,110
fatigue just that pressure causes the
test scores to drop and so they did the

155
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:47,800
exam or the what you call it the
experiment where the women and men were

156
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,260
told were giving you an exam it's a
standard maths exam and the women did

157
00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:00,220
you know the same group of people the
women did like 20 to 30% poorer on the

158
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,470
exam then amended in the same class and
they were managed to school they did a

159
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:14,250
separate be no different day separate
exam and said this exam is biased in the

160
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,630
men and women tend to do tend to score
exactly the same on it just that

161
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,260
instruction change the scores and the
women actually outperformed the men

162
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,260
because they didn't have that

163
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:38,109
women suck at math mental garbage that
goes on at static and I found that just

164
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:43,259
so fascinating that they were able to
replicate this study demonstrate that

165
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:54,239
that impact of those societal biases I
like to add another observation I think

166
00:16:54,239 --> 00:17:01,129
over the years if you look at within the
tech sector you have pure technical past

167
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:06,829
you have my dream and past your have
different fashionable and pod man Jim

168
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,209
empower women should be well I want to
really play now here is the interests of

169
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:20,620
change many women start as you near QAR
there then they would decide to move to

170
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:27,599
another functional way often they would
come to its program management that they

171
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,269
were would want more vital part of
management so the inches of state on the

172
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,610
pure tech sector

173
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,559
quickly changed from very interested to
I want to do something else now I never

174
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,960
read the Animas y but it's a very very
obvious right many of these women went

175
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,769
to a certain level they just stopped its
ok I want to the something else do more

176
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:55,870
about so today if you look at that right
like Symantec had a simple fantasticks

177
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,379
that are women

178
00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:00,990
percentage leadership in excess

179
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,970
ward but if you decipher them separate
them from marketing from partner

180
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:13,269
management engineer is always below that
of setting are most concerned because

181
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:18,539
I'm still in that sector as you know the
engineer cooperate and I want see more

182
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:25,779
women stay on that path ahead very early
on a female feral and she left after

183
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,909
that we never have another female fellow
so keeping women are picked track is

184
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,990
even more daunting and challenging job
for us as women we came courage at all

185
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:48,050
at the female you need to stay on the
engineering track and i have often run

186
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:55,190
into the you know the the shock and
surprise of colleagues meeting them that

187
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:03,120
I am technical and you know that there
is the 00 you know you actually

188
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,510
understand technology which is it's one
of those little things it's a tiny

189
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,140
little brush it off but it's that just
by a thousand paper cuz you know if it

190
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,590
does really get hold of that as a woman
in technology I feel like there is

191
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,300
constant credential checking do you
really know what you're talking about

192
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:35,419
you know and I don't know if you think
you saw it go to aris a few years ago

193
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,600
right I have gone are they like a bunch
but I really started going on and people

194
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,389
would be like you know what you do and I
would say well you know I'm on the

195
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,420
information security team and eBay and I
feel like I thought you were marketing

196
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,530
and I was like oh you know there's
there's a bias and you're in you're

197
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,860
sharing your bias with me and I have an
opportunity to point out that I'm an

198
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,669
exception for bias which is just kinda
cool and you know these are back then

199
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,960
sort of the day's a booth babes which is
like I know now which is great that it's

200
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,520
a no now and then there's interesting
thing about like you know there's like a

201
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,860
lot of parties a lot of drinking and
then like it left at 11 p.m. if you're

202
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,139
like a woman and you're out one of these
parties and events this week and then

203
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,630
people have certain types of behavior so
they exhibit you know and so it's it's

204
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,760
just a really interesting thing that
happens but I can relate to it and I'll

205
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,580
share another story which is all mine
but which is a female vice president at

206
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,290
eBay

207
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,310
and she would go around with a couple of
her direct reports and they would have

208
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,990
been in meetings and vendors would come
in and they would ask her to bring in a

209
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,530
chair or they would ask her to bring in
some coffee and she would do it because

210
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,510
she was like this is hilarious because
you're gonna find out in five minutes

211
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,790
that I'm the person you're trying to
sell to you know so so there was this

212
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,860
way in which the bias really screwed the
person with the bias and and I think

213
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,439
that you know it's it's great that the
organizers of this conference invited us

214
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,440
to talk about this thing and to share
our stories then you know with with each

215
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,530
interaction that happens where bias is
obvious or perhaps less obvious you know

216
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,720
there's an opportunity for us to just
sort of say the truth than say actually

217
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,620
I have a degree from UC Berkeley in like
20 Dairy Science actually I you know

218
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,060
whatever and then and then bit by bit
people become exposed to the reality

219
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:46,270
thank you girl and I i love that bit
about bias as examples of bias really an

220
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:53,940
opportunity to educate and reevaluate
you know change people's minds because

221
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,720
that's in my mind one of the most
challenging things are the the hidden

222
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,330
bias the bias that people won't admit to
and you know I have to admit that I

223
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:13,919
became aware that I had my own bias that
I was you know at the beginning of my

224
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,500
career I loved the idea that I was the
one girl the one chick who got it and it

225
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,710
wasn't like all the other girls and so I
had you know I participated in this bias

226
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,850
of the only technical person no I'm
really technical woman here all the

227
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,379
other women are probably marketing or
soft skills stuff and you know coming to

228
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,760
terms with my own bias was a little bit
of her

229
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:48,699
it's an unpleasant moments but that's
the only recognizing it is the only way

230
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,840
we can begin to change these things and
admitting that bias exists we all have

231
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:03,189
biases based on our experience you know
who are causing live and but becoming

232
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:09,820
aware of those and owning that bias in
trying to do something better about it

233
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:21,389
let's see on my questions for the panel
what do you see as some of the biggest

234
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,390
obstacles in the industry

235
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,539
I think and we did a great job of
talking about sort of the

236
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:44,408
competitiveness you know some of the
exhaustion you know I think they with

237
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:47,870
engineering regardless of whether you're
male or female

238
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,928
you know there is this fixation on like
solving a problem and sometimes that

239
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:56,460
takes these like circuitous routes that
you're like up all night and you're just

240
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:04,649
trying to figure it out and and maybe
maybe you're able to sort of manage your

241
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:08,879
your work life and your energy pounds
you know maybe you're not maybe burning

242
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,399
but I think that happens to to both men
as well as women so talking about

243
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:21,539
fatigue I remember my early time and
Norton we every year we have huge

244
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:29,480
release before release there were a
period we work very hard in every

245
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:36,380
problem we spend many nice entire 24
hours during several days in office with

246
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,179
dave also what they're right within our
lives we stay there for a week or two

247
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,409
just 24 by seven right so it's just
imagine if you have a young family you

248
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:50,710
have young kids it's very hard on your
family so that's when I think other

249
00:24:50,710 --> 00:25:01,450
obstacle is when it comes to promotion
and paving a path for women right we

250
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,630
need we need our male counterpart a male
peers to support us so this is not only

251
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:16,600
just a low level we need fun top-down we
need c-suite we need two companies to

252
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,559
support the idea that woman brings value
so they can support women now I saw

253
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,090
cases where these see their people say
yes I suppose woman but you can see

254
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,918
these are not really true thunderheart
because nothing happened did nothing and

255
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,330
you see other societies they really is
coming from their heart they will do

256
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:43,439
they will carry out specific task to
encourage woman includes a woman

257
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
especially

258
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,290
tech sector right thing engineering pass
so this weekend we can see the huge

259
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,909
difference having male support not so
I'm really glad to see that look portion

260
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,660
of male attendants here are you are you
can make this will change and if you

261
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:15,980
help your peers in your company you will
make their life a very big difference in

262
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,340
addition to the the burnout another
thing that's been a major challenge for

263
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,149
me and I think that a lot of people talk
about is imposter syndrome and I think

264
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,880
it has the same kind of source of like
everyone's just really smart so you know

265
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,900
when you're like in elementary school
it's like really easy to be the smart

266
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:42,950
kid but you know when you're in a field
full of the most like the smartest most

267
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,460
haunted most dedicated people like most
people I've ever worked with in my life

268
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,680
are not only really really brilliant but
also like work really hard and have a

269
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:59,000
lot of hobbies in just amazing people in
every possible way so it's really easy

270
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,420
to feel completely inadequate so I don't
really know what to do about that but

271
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:22,840
it sucks we haven't talked about and
there's actually a very important so I

272
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,139
think aw I feel based on my work soon
there's to pull province why is the

273
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,600
pipeline I i grew up in China I think in
China we started this woman half the sky

274
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,320
so we have more women in major like
engineering so by even that in my class

275
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,429
all of us are you still in only 57 women
someday last choose to stay in

276
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,950
technologies so I am Not sure for people
grow up here how many percentage of your

277
00:27:51,950 --> 00:28:04,570
girls major engineering right okay so
then when I enter a few early action

278
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,290
major insecurity in China I choose
securely because I think that's very

279
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:14,490
special feel a lot of my male partner or
student classmates the actually doing a

280
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:20,120
lot of development so that I wasn't so
it's interesting that when I came to you

281
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:27,239
as I started my Korea obscure I actually
I was the only women and junior so there

282
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,480
was one thing I want to mention I i
wanna be brutally cracked on my feet

283
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,250
smell like

284
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,750
co-workers the half hour whilst
housewife so they have support in her

285
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,960
family's of all women mostly made women
majoring engineers almost husband also

286
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,770
work in so we have to also suppose I
mean we don't have the support our

287
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:59,280
co-workers male co-workers house so a
lot of high YC for my like if I have any

288
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,500
women peer the end up making decisions
based on the opportunity that's better

289
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,290
for support a family so like the reason
I Creek doing consulting and moved the

290
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,649
Wells Fargo is because they still
working from home so that's a perfect

291
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,320
time

292
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:21,330
my kids before all my male partners like
my co-workers they all make it would

293
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,860
take a risky move to move around the
country you able to pick up and

294
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,899
opportunities so I singing order to that
company are solely to provide better

295
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,709
support I literally had when I was
pregnant I really in the meeting while

296
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:44,220
another male co-worker da his wife was
pregnant and she was working overtime

297
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,889
but colin has said there was no question
once we have the key my wife will give

298
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:55,258
up give up stop and pick up the kids and
because children is the most important I

299
00:29:55,259 --> 00:30:01,379
was pregnant with my kid he said that so
it's like reading her foot so this is

300
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:05,649
like we never want to talk about that
but I think trial burr's everything

301
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:09,779
clearly has a lot of Berlin all women
even though we work with compensation

302
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,500
but there are a lot of things we will it
take out when we travel we need to make

303
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,649
arrangements but mostly hospital ideas
for my male coworkers they are have a

304
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:28,418
full-time housewife so that I think I
think women's an excellent point I'm a

305
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:34,399
new mom so you know it's a really
resonates with me I am really lucky that

306
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,840
my husband is part time student and so
he's sort of our primary child-care

307
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,399
primary server household care and I'm
sort of like primary moneymaker and

308
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,620
that's the way that our team happens to
work I spoke on a panel similar to this

309
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,699
one certainly women leaders panel of
VMware like a couple months ago and all

310
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,600
the women on the panel happen to have
partners who supported them you know and

311
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,519
and so I think that there is this really
major fight family dynamic and having

312
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,870
sort of been a really big things like
you've got this alien sci-fi thing

313
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,309
that's happening to your body and
childbirth tremendously dramatic and

314
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,299
these are things that you know my
husband likes me and he's like I'm here

315
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:19,440
with you but I have no idea we really
going through so I think the family

316
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,929
component is it's a really big influence
I want to get something quick my

317
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:31,500
personal experience I live in four
countries during my life and I have

318
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,080
burst off to my two children when I live
in Canada Canada has a fantastic social

319
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,039
program by their parents father mother
can come by have-we off if you have a

320
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,720
child when you're off and be paid and
that they care system

321
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,200
subsided by the government at a time
twenty-five years ago I pay $5 a day for

322
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,639
my kid at daycare food care everything
ok so I moved to you sry my order was

323
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,529
ten year old it was hard I told everyone
I wouldn't be able to do my USA job if

324
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:13,149
my children were young because my
husband worked and analyst I found out

325
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:19,260
is in the USA get high percentage of
housewife full-time housewife I found a

326
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:26,919
lot of my software industry co workers
lot of them their wife do not work the

327
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:32,960
home picking out baby and even software
you near a firewall wife's went to the

328
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,570
academy to stop what you may give up and
they will stay home until that children

329
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:45,200
become older so that's a society the
social phenomenon specific in Aus so I

330
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,480
don't have children but I plan to
someday and this is something I worry

331
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,269
about a lot because I've had many male
co-workers who have children but I've

332
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:54,640
never worked with a woman who

333
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,210
has had children so I'm no model for
what that looks like I have no idea what

334
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:05,720
to expect so that is something I worry
about a lot but one thing that that i

335
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,520
think is a really fantastic trend is a
lot of Bay Area startups and big

336
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,970
companies but started to specially have
really amazing perks I worked for a

337
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,490
startup that offered that paid for house
cleaning like to bring it to have a

338
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,820
house cleaning service come true that
was amazing

339
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,530
companies will do laundry service for
free things like that like Aaron you

340
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,139
know you can get your car service onsite
like those kinds of things they're

341
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,740
ridiculous in some ways but in other
ways like it totally makes sense because

342
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,190
especially in the Bay Area

343
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:52,980
the reality is that you pretty much do
have to have two incomes so it makes

344
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,140
sense for the kind of the company's to
kind of step up and provide some of the

345
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,780
basic things that you need in your life
that are really really hard to get done

346
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:11,320
when you have to working partners so I
hope that that's like a trend that kind

347
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,380
of trickles through out through in into
other industries and other other parts

348
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,230
of the country where it becomes more
common to have these parts that help

349
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:30,130
with just everyday life things so yeah
for me there's there are some things

350
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,570
that and I i see hints that things are
changing I have kids as well

351
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:41,690
Mike user you know middle-school aged
elementary school age and it is

352
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:47,730
difficult balancing work and family life
even with companies that state that they

353
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:53,080
do that they're still that competition
of you know this single colleagues who

354
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,690
are willing to stay at all hours and you
know can be at the office at eight

355
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,880
o'clock where you know I'm dropping my
kids off at eight o'clock and I can get

356
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,380
there by

357
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:10,120
nine maybe fingers crossed that there's
no bad bad traffic but those demands on

358
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:16,540
families and that it's so in the USA in
particular if also disproportionately on

359
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,500
women

360
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,680
speaks a lot to are fairly rigid roles
about what it means to be male and

361
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,259
female and there's kind of this been you
know one of the discussion points in

362
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:35,740
Venice groups is how much sexism damages
men as well in holding them to a very

363
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:42,569
rigid role as well as women to a very
original and I I was lucky to grow up

364
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:49,920
with a single parent and my mother did
everything she was broke she fix fixed

365
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,660
it if things around the house need to be
fixed cheap she did that so I saw that

366
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:01,819
role model is that you know women can do
everything and grew up with out that

367
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:10,170
rigid role model of that's women's work
and that's men's work and so i i think

368
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,990
the more we can integrate that as our
society as we can change that and health

369
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,540
you know have a better discussion on
what it means to be men and women and

370
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,120
there's far more similarities and there
are differences and that's one of the

371
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,290
things that I really try and I see we
have a question and I want to question

372
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,590
in just a moment before we get to the
question I think we've done a lot of

373
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,180
really awesome storytelling is
storytelling here and I think it's

374
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,000
awesome that the women here are open
enough to share

375
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:49,020
there's there's good stuff to you know
and I wish that this panel was another

376
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,170
hour longer and we have opportunities to
talk to each other after the panel but

377
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,430
there's good stuff too and I do think
that we should spend some time on the

378
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,350
good stuff you know our little group met
about an hour ago and there's like

379
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,630
tremendous resources for girls to
increase our pipeline of women you know

380
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,930
there is there's resources for women in
the industry to connect with each other

381
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,850
there is the executive Women's Forum
there's grace hopper if there is a new

382
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,060
tab

383
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,910
bored there's a lot of role models and I
think that it's it's worth you know we

384
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,129
could kind of walk down online and talk
about some of the positive things

385
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,720
because there's an opportunity for
things to go in a really good direction

386
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,930
and then we do want to answer questions
from the attendees as well we've

387
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,730
fifty-minute block at the end to answer
questions from attendees so I'd like to

388
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:45,040
get to think what our last question
needs to be given time is what are the

389
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,540
resources and what are the success
factors for everybody to Carolyn's point

390
00:37:49,540 --> 00:38:02,120
exactly what things that have helped you
on your way were so what things me was I

391
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,210
i had had a boss went over to debate his
name is Dave colony and he was CIO so at

392
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,020
the time and he was like a total woman
supporter and it wasn't like he was a

393
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,230
woman sport was like it was a people
supporter and he's trying to build the

394
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,450
best he could and we had a
disproportionate number of women on our

395
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:21,399
information security to move you make
compared to what you might find in the

396
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,730
industry or even a technology so that
was cool and he introduced me this group

397
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:31,350
called the executive Women's Forum it's
run by Joyce work at which is recruiting

398
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:36,250
firm for information security risk
management of privacy and this group of

399
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,670
six or so women got a black on a run
into each other all the time and they

400
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,610
were like hey you know we should hang
out we should make this thing and so

401
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,830
there's this annual conference there's
all these events that happen one of the

402
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:53,620
things they've done to partner with
actually Carnegie Mellon I C squared and

403
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,310
the National Cyber Security Alliance
they put together this this curriculum

404
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:02,430
for school children boys and girls you
know K through 12 and it's like targeted

405
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,660
for each of those age groups see you
talk to a kindergartener about

406
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,399
information security differently than
you would talk to an eighth-grader about

407
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,130
information security but this curriculum
is built it's out there and they're

408
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,800
actually encourage people to teacher at
your children's schools are maybe

409
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,890
another kid you know teacher at one of
your local schools I'm so so they're

410
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,060
these things

411
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:29,130
so I'm part of this executive women's
forums group and you know one night

412
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,460
there's like a networking event and I've
had a couple glasses of wine and one of

413
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,700
my colleagues suggest to me she's like
you know you think about this metric

414
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,759
stuff maybe you should write a book and
it hadn't occurred to me before she

415
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,180
suggested that that was like I think
that was possible

416
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,600
you no answer fast forward you know I
end up asking some my female colleagues

417
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,860
to be contributors my book and so it
ends up in this team effort but but

418
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,490
these are just some of the things that
helped me you know great great mentors

419
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:06,959
and and resources that are available if
if if you want to happen I like to talk

420
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:24,330
about the resources out there right so
we talk about my personal life what is

421
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:31,299
what they are doing but also so what say
you can't help but feel a two of them

422
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:40,770
are really I think it's a cold shower
when our go out coach this kit to

423
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:48,970
program so that's when they're so our
anyone can be volunteers to organize one

424
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:57,490
of these even in December 21 here second
is girls who called by the movie so

425
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,000
these are resources out there in your
community

426
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:08,890
I'm sure there are many many of them but
also for career woman lot of other

427
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:14,770
origin of the Anita Borg Institute is
one of the organizers of the world's

428
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:20,960
largest conference for women called
grace hopper celebration for Women in

429
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,670
Computing every year than last year

430
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:30,130
attendance reached to 12 South people
coming from all over the world and the

431
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,440
accountant

432
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,450
career

433
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:42,759
and your career level USC keogh Meaghan
Smith friend I've discovered every year

434
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:50,440
she cums talk about polls last year she
brought her team your team female team

435
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,660
to the conference Sheryl Sandberg as
well so many of these resources out

436
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,700
there if you are interested I can give
you more information I have been

437
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,379
involved in that conference for Barrow
time so anyway we could talk afterwards

438
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,130
I want to give her something that Google
does

439
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:19,320
highly encouraged unconscious bias trade
offers and many many employees do if you

440
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,260
work for a large company I think that's
probably something like this it's I

441
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,150
think it it's incredibly valuable for
pretty much everyone in the industry

442
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,070
helps you identify your own diocese and
also helps you deal with situations

443
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:43,740
where you might be uncomfortable or see
a situation where someone else I I hope

444
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,209
that it's available to many of you from
your companies and if it isn't then it

445
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,760
might be a good thing to ask you for
your leadership because I think it's

446
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,970
something that everyone in a
professional environment should have

447
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,970
access to yeah I know there's

448
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,330
I'm sorry the name escapes me but it's
harvard or one of the East Coast

449
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,670
University's that does have an
unconscious bias catalog and some

450
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:16,110
resources that are free online and
available and for me some of the best

451
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,910
resources are expanding my mentor
network getting ahold of working out

452
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,600
some good mentor relationships one of
the early mistakes that I personally

453
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,990
made was looking for female mentors
specifically because they are usually

454
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:36,220
really busy expanding that to you know
I've got a lot of really great male

455
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,609
colleagues in looking at them as mentors
in figuring out some of these things can

456
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,369
really help

457
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:51,569
network my career and I hope that is
useful advice and helpful for other

458
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:52,390
people

459
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,650
well is really figuring out those mentor
relationships because they're very

460
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,819
valuable whether they're an organization
like EWF or you know personal

461
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:07,499
friendships that you develop and and
leverage from that so and I think we're

462
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:12,240
we are at our Q&A systems so so we have
time for questions

463
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:25,299
purple had a question first to comment
because I can totally see the potential

464
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:31,079
problems around the whole somehow
housewives others give birth but I come

465
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:37,519
from Sweden where housewives are almost
extinct and we have highly subsidized

466
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,308
child care and the numbers are the same
almost no women in tech almost no women

467
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:44,450
in

468
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:49,450
security tech III don't know maybe
there's no really I would even say a

469
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:55,589
more professional women insecurity in
the us- than in Sweden proportionally

470
00:44:55,589 --> 00:45:01,740
something to think about it but I wanted
to ask one thing about this whole bias

471
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:10,279
in that they're not into tech things I
can totally see that I was working with

472
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,089
a heavily when I was a teacher at
University trying to make sure I would

473
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:23,609
think of every woman or a man I met as a
student could be the nexts superhero and

474
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:27,848
you really need to train yourself to
think that way not assume that the

475
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:35,920
superhero has to be a guy so one thing
I've noticed is that many men try to

476
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,970
signal early like having a geeky t-shirt
maybe as the one hand right now about

477
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:47,799
filing radar to shake that thing off to
make people know immediately old kid

478
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,980
that's an Emacs person then then you can
assume that while I can bring up things

479
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:01,109
with this do you have any such things
working with that be way to do it

480
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:11,450
I think this is an interesting idea is
there a signal that you can give him a

481
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,328
technical person talk to me about the
right of technical conference right now

482
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:18,559
we're here so I think so i think thats
cool I think the swimming thing is

483
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,920
interesting too because you know around
the world so we can kind of zoom out and

484
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,430
we can say around the world this problem
looks different in different places

485
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:33,538
where the united states and we're having
a conference about application security

486
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:37,410
and there is women and security panel
and that's totally cool I can almost

487
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:43,640
guarantee use is not happening in Japan
and Sweden they've got way awesomer

488
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,069
childcare and in Canada Oscar child care
in the United States it's different I

489
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:55,730
also wanted to another another theme
here that we will briefly call out

490
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,730
explicitly is the bigger picture is not
about women it's about diversity right

491
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:06,430
so we look around and and there's a
diversity situation my husband's sister

492
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:12,919
is a single mom of 4 kids for dads all
have african-american they live in

493
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,609
Indianapolis and my daughter who is
growing up in San Francisco will have

494
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:23,730
different opportunities than her cousins
and I'm so excited that we're flying out

495
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,720
my 10 year old nephew RJ to services go
to stay with us for two weeks so he can

496
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,140
see like this different version of the
world you know and there's all of this

497
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,319
you know we can speak to some of the
Harvard Business Review studies that

498
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:40,558
spend on recently that says diversity on
teams helps make better decisions and

499
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,849
kinda like no doubt right of people
think differently about a problem there

500
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:52,150
are more opportunities to solve it in
different ways so so I did in the

501
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,569
business for a long time and I've had
many many managers and I can say

502
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:03,380
speak to me that the best managers have
ever had were women might be the best

503
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,830
working relationships I've had with with
a manager Ben women it might be a

504
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:12,620
coincidence but I think probably not a
non-expert theory is that when you get

505
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:17,509
men together there's always this kind of
testosterone thing going on that just

506
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:22,030
kind of clouds judgments whereas when
you have a male against female the

507
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,120
matter who's in the you know subordinate
position this just less of that stuff

508
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:32,100
going on and you make just better
decisions and judgments so in a male

509
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,330
dominated industry I'm wondering what
your guys thoughts are on whether it's

510
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:42,040
just possible that women might be better
managers in a male dominated industry

511
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:49,970
and white diamond you get the same sense
30 so for me and there's another

512
00:48:49,970 --> 00:49:01,839
question in the back there to the four
me anytime you get a modernist group

513
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:08,660
you're going to have your you've got
clouded judgement you can't see the full

514
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:15,560
picture the more diverse your group if
you've got people from different

515
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,710
backgrounds different walks of life

516
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,370
different visibility you're going to
make better decisions it tones down that

517
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:30,000
the competition the the testosterone
cloud whatever you want to call it when

518
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,170
you have a more diverse group making
decisions we talked earlier today about

519
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:45,610
the you know the company cultures can
have to a bullying culture where you

520
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:51,800
know the loudest voice wins it's not
really about what the best solution is

521
00:49:51,800 --> 00:50:00,610
but who's willing to fight to the death
for that solution and with a with a

522
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:03,980
diverse team with people from different
walks of life

523
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:10,670
different sexes that we have we've all
experienced I think fairly universally

524
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,700
is that the better diversity is
representation on the team

525
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:20,630
the better decisions are made the less
of a bullying culture is allowed to form

526
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:30,870
and persist to answer to my question I
will be a better manager right I think

527
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:37,069
that my experience is about the dynamics
of that group manager and as a bonus

528
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:44,260
right how each other view each other how
they can work together as a team that is

529
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:50,660
the huge the decision factor defective
factor to influence that relationship

530
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:57,430
like there are cases that you can't come
up very well with a female leader of

531
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:03,399
male subordinate no problem based but it
can also come up with a situation where

532
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,760
a female leader just have a few people
just can't I personal experience these

533
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:16,550
cases dad I had never had a problem and
recent I had a problem I have a

534
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:24,360
diversity where when male person just
didn't work out that also affect the

535
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:32,430
relationship I had with that email so I
recession is really the dynamics the

536
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,629
dynamics a Maltese people can you guys
work well together if you can't no

537
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,720
matter what good the manager is no
matter how good that he nays things just

538
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,720
won't work

539
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:59,969
and part of it is that I always tell
them like what I do engineering and

540
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:03,919
everything and the first thing that
comes to match their minds like well

541
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:10,328
that's too intense for women and
intimidating and I try to encourage them

542
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:16,169
though it just takes a lot of work you
have to work a lot like and I don't know

543
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:20,868
what have you tried in terms of
encouraging women on a one-to-one basis

544
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:27,759
or maybe in a small group settings that
can really do to me and I've tried many

545
00:52:27,759 --> 00:52:39,699
times and hopefully I just tried your
question and indirect way I've read this

546
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:44,459
book recently and I highly recommend it
it's called I know how she does it and

547
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:51,089
this author went and talked to me like
hundreds of women who made over a

548
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:58,499
hundred K year and who also had families
and her theory was that these women have

549
00:52:58,499 --> 00:53:03,299
something figured out and what she asked
them to do was to keep timing marks in

550
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:07,349
30 increment 30 minute increments for
two weeks and they wrote down everything

551
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:15,719
they do and she found out that there is
this there's a sly about working so hard

552
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:20,019
sometimes some people actually work

553
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:25,279
$100 a week some people work 35 hours
weekly say they work 50 hours a week and

554
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:31,489
there is this like cool thing we're so
hard and so tired and it's like some of

555
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:37,429
those real and some of its not and
what's unfortunate about it is that if

556
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:40,849
somebody believes that it's real but
it's not that they make decisions based

557
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:46,479
on the life and this this book is super
cool because she's like these women make

558
00:53:46,479 --> 00:53:50,640
tons of money they've got really great
jobs they manage their families actually

559
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,650
they don't work more than 40 hours a
week there is total disbelief if I look

560
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:57,220
at my lifestyle and I compare that

561
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,509
to one of my friends who is a great
school teacher

562
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:06,380
you know and I asked a kid and their ten
or fifteen or twenty you know who you

563
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,180
think has like a tougher time at work
and I told my friend who's the teacher

564
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,970
has a tougher time and a lot of that for
me personally is because I could work

565
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,689
from home so much of the time you know
but that's what the cool things about

566
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:21,300
working in tech there are some jobs
where because it happens with the laptop

567
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,599
and with a cellphone you get to work
from home

568
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,550
my teacher friend can't work from home
she can't be with her you know

569
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,990
ten-month-old son the way that I get to
be with my 10 month old daughter because

570
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,939
of this technology difference so there
are these lines are propagated you know

571
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,950
we get we get programmed unconsciously a
lot of the time from from child from

572
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:42,649
from childbirth you know when you look
at your your daughter maybe and you say

573
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,280
you know you're in charge of harmony

574
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,580
you know you need you know everything
needs to be cool when you're kind of in

575
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,009
charge of making sure we get along so
maybe that's why some women are great

576
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,070
painters you know when you leave your
little boy nearly you know you gotta

577
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,720
earn the money you better study hard or
something whatever it is you know these

578
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,109
things that I think that there are there
are lies and want to Liza's I work so

579
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:07,040
much and that's not always alive but
sometimes so this book I know how she

580
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,180
does it totally cool not only for women
but also maybe four men who are like

581
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,790
well maybe there's a way for me to live
my life and spend my hours little

582
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:24,810
differently to make me happier about
that is I think we're a little girl

583
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,790
might say like that

584
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,440
career looks to me like I that's too
intimidating I don't care I don't think

585
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,180
that I think what she's actually saying
it like that is foreign to me like it

586
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:41,330
looks good it looks different than me
because no one would say that being a

587
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:46,500
doctor is not an intense career but the
gender imbalance has

588
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:53,980
has even out there so I don't think it's
really that children think something is

589
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,480
too intense for them I think it's just a
way of saying like it's not me doesn't

590
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,020
look like me I can't see myself doing
that so I don't know if it's not

591
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:09,160
particularly constructive but like you
know if someone were to say that to me I

592
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,609
think I would say it like you can do
something intense like there's no reason

593
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:17,220
that that you should be able to do that
intense career as compared to a million

594
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,810
other intense careers that you would be
interested in

595
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:24,660
don't think it's more it's more likely
problem of a lack of role models or lack

596
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:31,868
of lake water alert the presence of
stereotypes that contributes that's just

597
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:38,490
my gut feeling I know we have enough
time to quickly so the event so I went

598
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,560
back to these students female students
and men ask question i three president

599
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:48,859
wants to become a doctor who wants to be
a lawyer

600
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:57,810
engineer so exposure had wiry and maybe
one thing I said yes I recommend you to

601
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:03,080
do I did with my brothers when they were
in high school I gave them one summer

602
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:09,869
project which look at choose a three
potential profession you want to be in

603
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:19,340
the future to study how the study lends
how hard her second is where you can

604
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:24,210
really get into that field job
opportunity and so is the money you can

605
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:30,100
do this and come back tell me what you
want to be I think that they did that if

606
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:35,368
he chooses what they want to be and they
are and where you are and that's why I

607
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,480
feel ashamed

608
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,740
but I think that's at least they went
through this they learn they understood

609
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,680
and this ok that's what I want to do so
today they don't have real wet even

610
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,609
possible work very hard very rare even
work harder then software engineer I

611
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:57,720
managed but the other happy what they do
so I think that another way to teach

612
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:05,660
them give them a chance to find out by
themself well I'd like to thank

613
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:13,580
everybody we really amazing insights and
hopefully the audience got a good

614
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:20,220
discussion in some things to think about
and consider and I loved all of the

615
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:25,899
feedback seems you're all working to get
more women in technology and security I

616
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:31,730
think having a more diverse population
just improves the field tremendously so

617
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,700
thank you all for participating in the
discussion and thank you to our

618
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:43,319
panelists Carolyn where we thank you
