1
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,579
hi everyone thanks for coming I'm stand
me and this is driving like you acted

2
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,880
this is a fun talk business continuously
working on improving as I'm doing

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,460
research and a couple of different areas
a couple really fun areas for me have

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,659
been vehicles vehicles radio hardware
and we're going to focus a little bit on

5
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,680
some of that stuff which is really fun
to me

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,949
will cover some web stuff as well and
then try to bring it all together in a

7
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:55,480
fun way so we all love Nicolas Cage
right yeah okay I love nicholas cage so

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,709
I thought gone in 60 seconds like one of
my favorite movies so I've spent my

9
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,349
entire life trying to be like him so as
gone in 60 seconds happens you know

10
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:11,449
basically Nic Cage's going around
stealing cars spoil it for anyone but to

11
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,160
do that the first thing you need to do
is you need to get into a garage which

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,009
has like some really cool cars so in the
last year I've been looking at how can I

13
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,640
break into garages like how to Rogers
work and garages are pretty cool we all

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,930
have sort of we've all seen the clicker
right little garage clicker have one

15
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,380
here so I started learning about how
these things work and my goal was to

16
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,100
break into my own garage I like I'm in a
condo units so there's a bunch of

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,320
different cars down there and I want to
see how this thing works so I started

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,179
running a little bit our radio frequency
and how radios and communicating with

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,719
devices like garage door openers works
so the first thing we're gonna be easily

20
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,679
go in depth here and I'm gonna show you
how how this stuff works let's do some

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,740
live demonstrations the first thing you
do when learning about something with

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,280
radio is there something really cool any
device in the USA that transmits that

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,810
actually transmits radio frequency has
to have an SEC I D so if you put your

24
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,440
phone all of our phones actually have an
FCC idea on the back here so like my

25
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,980
iPhone I ICNS TCID so same thing with
this garage door opener which opens my

26
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,560
garage so what we can do is we can
actually take one of these things and

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,680
open up our garage and if we look at
CCAD

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,739
the cool thing about the FCC is what
they do is they regulate transmission

29
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,329
and EUS so if you want to transmit on
radio frequency the SEC has to allow

30
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:43,299
that device manufacturer to do it and
what we can do is all of the information

31
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,409
about that ideas actually public
information so you can actually go to

32
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:52,649
the SEC is website which is really
really hard to use and search for these

33
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,329
IDs fortunately someone named Dominic
still has created a website called FCC .

34
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:03,000
I which I use all the time and basically
on SEC . I owe you can just type in the

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,579
identifier back on either this garage
door opener or your garage door itself

36
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:11,569
or your phone so he actually pull up
your phone and you can look up the FCC

37
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,849
idea and you can learn all about what
your phone transmits all is actually

38
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:20,879
very cool and inside of their will see a
few things so the first thing we see is

39
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,719
often you'll see pictures of the actual
device both the outside on the left here

40
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,189
and the inside so you actually see
inside of that circuit this is really

41
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,828
cool if you're trying to look up
information on say a device that you

42
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,129
don't necessarily have access to or
device that might be out of your price

43
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,810
range or advice that's not released yet
rights and that's coming out you can

44
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,190
actually go here you can learn a ton of
information you could probably produced

45
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,930
you know you can probably discovered
vulnerabilities are issues with the

46
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,069
device before it even comes out it's
pretty incredible so here's an example

47
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,078
of actually my garage door opener I
looked it up and the first thing we see

48
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,389
here is we see kinda like where it came
from

49
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,879
came from China obviously and you'll see
the the range here the frequency range

50
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,918
so this is the frequency that
communicates on and on this one it says

51
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,329
the lower frequencies 390 megahertz in
the upper is 399 yards so that means

52
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:18,909
this communicate on 11 frequency 390
megahertz was pretty cool so what else

53
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:24,419
we see on on FCC we see stuff like the
cover letter is a nice little formal

54
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,669
letter today right external photos like
we saw internal photos couple different

55
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:37,419
things one of the more interesting areas
is the the test report so what the FCC

56
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,060
does that hire someone to come out and
actually test your device because the

57
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,620
thing with the with frequencies were

58
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,910
such as sharing the spectrum like you
don't wanna device just constantly

59
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,510
transferred out and prevent other
devices from working for example if I

60
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,130
just held this garage door thing it is
reduced transmitting all the time it may

61
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,080
prevent other garage door openers from
working and you wouldn't want to

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,690
interfere with say someone across the
street so they do all these tests ensure

63
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,460
that it transformed the frequencies it's
allowed to not more powerful than it

64
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,289
should

65
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,419
so on and so forth so he pulled it up
and see like the internal report week

66
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:19,680
actually often see spectrograph actual
recording of that of the radio signal

67
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,720
transmitted by the device and there are
some different devices I use to actually

68
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,560
listen to this kind of stuff

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,639
one of the races really cool it's a car
F it's capable of receiving entrance

70
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,880
transferring from one megahertz all the
way up to 60 Hertz really wide range

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,469
totally open source open hardware couple
hundred dollars you can also transmit

72
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,710
which is really interesting people have
done some really crazy stuff with this

73
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:52,340
thing for example spoofing GPS GPS using
this device or similar devices have made

74
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,500
ships go off course ship slurry going
off course because we're depending on

75
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,639
the depending on GPS has GPS works it's
from radio signals getting sent from

76
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,500
satellites down to the earth and we're
using that to like figure out where we

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,539
are and someone comes along and
transmits a signal and you think you're

78
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:12,159
somewhere else are you going somewhere
else I mean the amount of dependency

79
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,220
that we have on these radio signals is
massive and growing every single day

80
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,419
there's another reason that this is like
such an interesting thing and I'm so

81
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,448
interested in this right now and now you
may say okay well I don't know anything

82
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,550
about radio and I know very little about
radio personally but you can do some

83
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,620
pretty simple things for example if
you're dealing with something that uses

84
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,410
a fixed transmission something that
we're it's like a password so if you

85
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,599
open your garage door opener a lot of
our garage door openers basically have a

86
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,400
bunch of DIP switches which is
essentially a password and that opens

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,888
your garage now if you don't know
someone's like if I were trying to

88
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,740
exploit some of the garage trying to
break in what I might do is I might

89
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,020
record that signal and replay it and

90
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,049
often do that now not all devices are
capable of recording and replaying often

91
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,180
you need to know a lot more information
about the signal which will learn a bit

92
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,919
but with nearly two commands you can
record and replay recording you know

93
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,789
taking a microphone and speaker Andrew
reproducing some signal now this will

94
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,520
work in some scenarios none all
scenarios for example cars are you

95
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,299
something called rolling codes that
later where the passwords changing kind

96
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,129
of like to go authenticator or to have a
right you might get to have a is

97
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:28,860
essentially rolling code where every
time you get a new identifier a new

98
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,710
password to login something another
device they use is RTL SDR this is

99
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,489
awesome I have it right here it's
basically another antenna it's a soft

100
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,490
STR means offer defined radio RTL from
Realtek and suffer defined radio is a

101
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,400
corrupt is also a software-defined radio
it allows you to use software and

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,739
inexpensive hardware to analyze the
radio spectrum and also often

103
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,909
transmitted RTL SDR is great because
like $20 in the Amazon you can go right

104
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,180
now for 20 bucks get into it you know
start learning and you can do so much

105
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,110
you can see planes going overhead
there's actually someone in LA who did

106
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,069
who has been recording planes so its
public transmission whenever a plane is

107
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,949
flying it's sending radio signal of
where it is

108
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,219
of its GPS coordinates information about
it unique name and he started mapping it

109
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:26,279
out as a hobby and he found that there's
these planes that are just circling over

110
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,390
LA It's going in circles right they lift
off the fly around in a circle why are

111
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,279
their plane circling over LA and said
look what that correct FBI planes he's a

112
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,159
guy who discovered that these are FBI
planes going around probably using

113
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,339
something like stingray to listen to
your phone calls and text messages so

114
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:53,110
always say hi FBI when you pick up the
phone so RTLS yours another really cool

115
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,040
example he did that with RTL SDR to $20
device you can use free software open

116
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,329
source software on your computer no
matter you know in any major operating

117
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,099
system

118
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,730
new radio this is like this is a fun or
the complicated piece of software

119
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,949
that is prolly not complicated is really
hard for me to learn so I'm still trying

120
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,899
to figure out how to use the same but it
allows you to take a radio signals are

121
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,480
actually any signal technically you can
just type audio into it and you can

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,990
manipulate it you can run different
filters on in extract information or

123
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:29,209
transmit information so this is another
really useful tool GRX this is awesome

124
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,109
tool actually uses in a minute I'll show
you how it works basically this allows

125
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,230
us to see a waterfall view of the
spectrum of the radio spectrum so we can

126
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,360
say all right I want to see from 302 301
megahertz MHz everything that happens on

127
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,279
there this would allow you to that made
it so you have a device and you don't

128
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,649
have the SEC I D

129
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,579
let's say you don't have access to a
device let's say you're outside of

130
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,120
something and you have a black box or
you know someone is driving up to the

131
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,680
garage and they're about to hit about
you but you don't know what frequency

132
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,109
devices using you can use this to
essentially watch watch a waterfall of

133
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,139
radio frequencies and you will see when
there is something with a high amplitude

134
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,279
when there is essentially a signal its
getting transmitted really cool this is

135
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,620
for Linux and OSX only if you're on
Windows you can also get str sharp

136
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,790
another similar tool to do the same
thing very cool and the cool thing is I

137
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,079
mean they're people out there like on
reddit there's a there's a subreddit

138
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,130
called RTL SDR and you can actually go
on there and people are just looking at

139
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,000
the spectrum because there's all these
radio frequency out there and we have no

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,120
idea what a lot of them are right a lot
of these you know this is this is

141
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,490
something that invisible right
essentially invisible to us and usually

142
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,350
when there's something invisible people
just assume insecure because we can't

143
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,420
see it we don't know how it works and
more and more people are now playing in

144
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,000
this area and researching and trying to
find what are all these invisible

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,010
signals and a lot of it

146
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,040
lack security I mean really interesting
some of the stuff that's coming out of

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
here

148
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,069
RTL FM this is like a command-line tool
that allows you to record signals with

149
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:05,689
RTL SDR so these are some of the tools
that I use the presentation will be

150
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,329
available

151
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,349
our minds of viewers want to grab it and
and do any research in here you'll have

152
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,970
access to all of that so let's go back
to the SEC report there are three things

153
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,160
I usually look at when I'm looking at an
SEC report for

154
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,520
for a device internal photos because you
see inside if I can see inside I might

155
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,380
be able to make out the chip that's
being used by a look at the chip I can

156
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,700
probably look up data sheets available
for that chip and I can learn all about

157
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,290
what the chip is doing the frequency
communicates on the modulation all sorts

158
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,750
of information about it I can look at
the test report as well and the test

159
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,920
report will will often provide some
useful information such as what

160
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,030
frequencies it uses perhaps we'll
modulation and then also the user manual

161
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,010
there's always like incredible piece of
information in user manuals that I find

162
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,180
a friend of a friend I was at Coachella
he's like yeah I came back to my card

163
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,420
all my windows were down there was
anything stolen is like no luckily also

164
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,040
like someone broke into my car and
didn't take anything that seems weird so

165
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,689
I looked at the FCC ideas like maybe
someone hacked his devices like radio

166
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,370
thing for his his car key and it looked
it looked it up and looked at the user

167
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,500
manual and it's just a section of how
the car key operates and everything

168
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,320
about the car key and apparently behold
one of the buttons down far enough

169
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,430
seconds all your windows rolled down
I've been told them I'm going to use

170
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:35,349
against them so here's an example the
test report from a from my garage door

171
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,040
opener and you can see we can see
something called the frequencies 390

172
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,730
megahertz we see the modulation type is
ASX rascal will go over that in the

173
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,220
second here and a couple of things about
the device so it's a great modulation

174
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:56,740
little bit here has listened to the
radio ok younger people may not know

175
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:04,740
what that is like Spotify so we now have
things there there's different types of

176
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,660
modulation is basically how we encode
data in a signal there's asked which is

177
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,980
amplitude shift keying there's a FSK
frequency shift keying and PSK

178
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,440
phase-shifting these are common
modulation schemes are used now these

179
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,400
are specifically for digital data when
you're trying to communicate digital

180
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,280
information over over the radio spectrum
now ask is actually amplitype of

181
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,900
amplitude modulation amplitude
modulation is a.m. it's little the a.m.

182
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,459
radio

183
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,570
when using your AM radio Radio is taking
the radio spectrum at whatever frequency

184
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,400
or listen you to say 200 killer and
amplitude which is essentially if you

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,750
listen to let you sound file right the
amplitude is the volume is essentially

186
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:52,560
how strong that volume is the amplitude
defines where what kind of sound you're

187
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,910
hearing or what frequency to sound is
that frequency shift keying is frequency

188
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,160
modulation or FM FM radio in 2010 2.7

189
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,280
actually listen to 10 2.7 measures and
we can use that we can see that RTLS Dr

190
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,100
and the frequency is actually not 10 2.7
it's actually a range so it's actually

191
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,890
more like one or two point five to 10
2.9 and the frequency changes depending

192
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,550
on where you know what that sound with
their frequency should be something like

193
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,810
RTL SDR we can also if we don't know
what devices transmitting we can look at

194
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,479
it here and on the left we see that
there's kinda like two signals coming

195
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,640
whenever I hit a button so that's public
something called two of us ko

196
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,640
frequencies 15 where the frequency is
changing and because its digital is just

197
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,819
100 rose so left or right means 10 and
then on the right we have asked which is

198
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,610
amplitude shifting we're just either
there's a signal or there's not a signal

199
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,840
which represents a 10 so when we
actually I don't actually see what this

200
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,210
looks like I'm going to open dq iraq's
enemies the Sartorialist yard so we can

201
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:12,880
take a quick look at see this works here
right so so we can see here I met three

202
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,030
hundred megahertz which is what this
garage door opener is at and whenever I

203
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,880
press we can see data so that's pretty
cool like if I fighting know what

204
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,210
frequency was that we could like go
searching through you know we could go

205
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,590
to say here we have we have actual
stations writes about 100 megahertz now

206
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,900
so we can actually see FM radio stations
and I can actually modulate this data I

207
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,810
don't see that

208
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:44,979
so we'd have to tune

209
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,560
executed different facing fear

210
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,220
that's right there 'cause so we actually
know that this is that three hundred

211
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,240
megahertz now this is really cool we can
be modulated state are right here so now

212
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,630
that we know it's again we'll look at
once more here

213
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:17,670
393 her megahertz and because it looks
like it's just 16 turning on and off

214
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,849
that tells me it's probably amplitude
shift team or a.m. amplitude modulation

215
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:31,420
so we can then use RTL FM's quit that
let's see here on my Windows alright so

216
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:38,939
that's gonna be hard to see but their
largest recorded first so I'll say RTL

217
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,210
three hundred tests always a press this
once or twice

218
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,870
great control see and what this actually
does this produces an audio file away

219
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,000
file that we can then inspect so I'm
gonna pull this up in Audacity free

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,780
audio tool let me find the file here and
I will throw this in here right now

221
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,470
there's other city so here we can see I
clicked I hit it twice it wants here and

222
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,620
then once here so let's take a look at
what the signal actually looks like you

223
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:13,060
mean it looks like it's a repeating
signal looks like the same information

224
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,980
now who is open one of these garage
doors and had to accept the DIP switches

225
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,530
he had to do that

226
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,910
alright so we've seen those usually it's
like 10 or 12 the switches let's do man

227
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,540
can you get with these relate to

228
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:36,690
so if I open my right here the thing is
impossible open right now I'll tell you

229
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:45,000
what I have here on and off that
switches mine is on on off on zoo man we

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,440
can see if there's any correlation at
all on on off on off on off off off off

231
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,820
so basically we're seeing influence you
actually seeing a signal in this case it

232
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,460
looks like a long signal followed by
nothing long is 01 and sort they're not

233
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,450
followed by nothing is as Europe so
literally just by using this $20 device

234
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:14,240
I recorded and I now know the code to my
garage door you could go around like

235
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
recording Co like just like in gone in
60 seconds right they go up to the

236
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,340
garage they use their little device
would probably didn't exist and they are

237
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,540
able to record the code that's so
interesting right so let's go back to

238
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:35,220
all agree is going with that

239
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,559
figure out how to open I'm not marrying
here so all windows

240
00:18:52,550 --> 00:19:01,680
back to the side so we decided heroics
and we saw this right so we actually

241
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,530
analyze that signal we saw this
repeating signal he repeats a bunch of

242
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,940
times because amplitude shift keying
like if you've ever listen to audio

243
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,820
sucks it sucks it's it's very easy to
get the most inexpensive way to transmit

244
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:22,100
information but it's also the most prone
to interference people's nothing you can

245
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,639
really see if anything they are so
someone had a good suggestion

246
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,659
brute force that how long will it take
well if you take a look at these

247
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,140
different garage doors there's a couple
different things

248
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,910
summer summer ten bits 12 it's right
there just on and off so I recorded this

249
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,390
one and it looked like he was two
milliseconds per bit with the two

250
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,120
millisecond delay for each bit and it
sent five signals trooper transmission

251
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,699
minimum so if we calculate that for all
the possible garage doors that I've

252
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,410
looked at your pics codes it looks like
it would take about 2929 a half minutes

253
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,710
to boot for us so easily 30 minutes but
for some of the garage which is pretty

254
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,100
insane

255
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,399
looking at this and I was like well can
I do this little faster because I have

256
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,600
stuff to do to sit outside of people's
homes thirty minutes and do this and i

257
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,409
was looking and I thought ok well if
it's repeating the signal what if we

258
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,680
stop repeating the second it's repeating
just so that it can be more successful

259
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,550
but for the most most part we're not
going to have interference so if you

260
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,129
actually take out the repetition

261
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,120
we can actually reduce the 26 minutes to
brute force any fixed code garage that's

262
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,310
pretty cool but looking at this further
I saw that there is basically this

263
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,860
massive period of weight of delay
between every time it sends a signal so

264
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,189
what if I took out that delay we're
sending one signal followed by like one

265
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,500
Password followed by another password
instead of Adelaide between them what I

266
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,690
just sent password password password
password and that worked to open my

267
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:58,380
garage so that reduce it down to three
minutes to open any fix code grass and

268
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,010
then I was thinking how does it know
where one Password begins in one pass

269
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,799
programs what if it's using something
called a bit

270
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,129
shift register now a bit shift registers
basically register where you you pull in

271
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:14,389
data one bit at a time and as it's
essentially perform the tests would say

272
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:18,399
it's a four-bit register it looks the
four bits and it performs a test is this

273
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,719
the correct for a bit if not it then
takes one bit off pops one off and then

274
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,549
shifts one in well if that's the case
you wouldn't actually test all possible

275
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:31,879
codes you can actually just pop up for
example if I used let's say let's say

276
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:36,509
I'm looking at this is a two-bit code
but they were just looking at a two-bit

277
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:37,480
code right here

278
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:45,159
00011 1104 options that's a total of
eight bits however if we create

279
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:50,480
something called the debris debris in
sequence deploying the mathematician who

280
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,889
discovered this algorithm to efficiently
produce all possible codes over that

281
00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:02,629
overlap so we overlap these we can save
00 110 now he put them in which have

282
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:06,969
registered we get 200 is the first two
bits and if we move over just one bit

283
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:13,049
then we get 2011 bit we get 11 and in
the last 10 so we'd actually gone all

284
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:19,299
eight bit out of 5 bit sequins now if we
do that with every eight to 12 bit code

285
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:25,609
we actually reduce this down to eight
seconds to brute force any fix code

286
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:29,960
garage between eight and 12 its long
eight seconds

287
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
yeah

288
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:43,409
gone over all of the infrared codes that
are basically public information from

289
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:47,940
the televisions TV B Gone you could do
that but TV began specifically turns off

290
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,359
TVs so if you're a brute forcing what
you'd actually end up doing is like

291
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,359
changing the volume changing the import
store is doing all this other stuff

292
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,149
TV B Gone specifically has programmed
all of the IR codes for different

293
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:02,279
televisions but you can definitely do
something similar because you will hit

294
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,519
the auth code at some point right so at
this point we have eight seconds now

295
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,440
this is just how to transmit RTL SDR
does not actually transmitted this is

296
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,039
just an assumption of how we can mess
with with this garage now we need a

297
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,229
device to actually transmitted one
device i'ma fan of his yardstick one

298
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:27,159
also by Michael Austin this has a nice
radio chip receiving and transmitting

299
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,929
its not software defined radio

300
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,700
defined radio allows you to take a very
a single you know nothing about and

301
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,149
perform all the modulation demodulation
and accessing and reading it in software

302
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:44,590
this is all hardware there there's pros
and cons the con the major cause of

303
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,470
something like this is that if you don't
know what the signal is if you don't

304
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,999
know if its frequency modulator
amplitude modulated or the frequency

305
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:54,889
this is not going to be too helpful
because you have to tell this to tell

306
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:59,139
the hardware I know it's FSK a note on
this frequency i knows this data rate

307
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:03,629
and show me the data or transmit the
data but if you know what you're looking

308
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:08,428
for or you know what you want to
transmit you can use this device and you

309
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:12,840
there's a Python interface that you can
use by something called our Afghan and

310
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:19,649
there's another device that that I like
to use from this from one of the most

311
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,959
amazing technological companies of our
time will tell

312
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:29,919
so Mattel creates all sorts of awesome
toys for children and one of their

313
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,149
devices one of their toys is called the
Mattel Miami this is a texting device

314
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:40,768
for tweens to basically communicate with
each other without being on the Internet

315
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:44,210
where people hang out so I M E

316
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,470
you can actually text someone and it
wirelessly transmits to a little dog

317
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,359
along on a USB stick and then it goes
over the Internet to your friend who

318
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,928
also has one of those USB dongles in NYC
transmits to the this little device to

319
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,169
the IME the service is no longer active
they don't sell these anymore so you can

320
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,720
get them off ebay for like 10 $20 and a
couple of people have found that inside

321
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,190
of this device is a really cool chipset
from texas instruments and it's a sub

322
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,239
gigahertz transceiver that means it can
receive and transmit on virtually any

323
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:18,720
frequency under one gigahertz which is
actually amazing if you're trying to

324
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,230
build a device like this yourself by
cost hundreds of dollars thanks to

325
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,840
Mattel and massive production you can
get it for like 10 bucks on eBay so

326
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,678
Travis Goodspeed and some other people
found out that you can connect to the

327
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,330
back of this thing and reprogram it and
do whatever you want with a transceiver

328
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,509
so this is the device I chose to use for
transmitting across all the different

329
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:44,850
garage frequencies performing this
attack and I call this the Open Sesame

330
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,939
attack they are

331
00:25:49,660 --> 00:26:03,210
now we get this video here I'm sorry so
that's an example of the open just

332
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,880
running on my friend garage it takes a
total max amount of eight seconds which

333
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:19,290
on average is 4 seconds so awesome 11
step down so I've released almost

334
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,170
everything to do this obviously I don't
people breaking into people's garages so

335
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,680
I did not I bricks the codes that it
would not work however I released most

336
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,430
of it so that people could understand
how this type of attack works and also

337
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,200
how to how to prevent it

338
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,660
unfortunately since I did that the
prices of raids of the IME so if you do

339
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,930
want one reached out to me I'd be happy
if anyone ever going to do some research

340
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,610
in this area I bought them before they
they became kind of ridiculously priced

341
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,860
so some lessons here don't use a
ridiculously small key space just

342
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,780
because it's invisible rages over radio
and people aren't looking doesn't mean

343
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,010
people aren't going to look right at
some point people will look they will

344
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,980
understand the technology your
proprietary method is not going to help

345
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,330
you so have the there's plenty of
information on this require preamble

346
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,939
rsync word which is basically something
that says the password is about to start

347
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,850
that would prevent the brain attack
where you can actually have all these

348
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,800
passwords for the ball rolling over each
other and enrolling codes that's another

349
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,129
thing we'll talk about throwing codes
will prevent the site of the attack on

350
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,630
our site of the crash and some cool
stuff when you hear one thing that's

351
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,280
happening is over cars are becoming
connected so great so a lot of new cars

352
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,480
now have all sorts of different radios
inside besides am/fm SiriusXM radio's

353
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,880
they have some other things they often
have GSM they'll have GPS receivers and

354
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,680
they'll communicate with the Internet
has OnStar OnStar yeah ok a lot of you

355
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,860
have us are not raise your hand that's
ok

356
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,080
so actually negm vehicle GMC Buick
Cadillac were actually has OnStar

357
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,350
built-in now you know whether you like
it or not is irrelevant you actually

358
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,820
have these features and those features
are connected to the computer of the car

359
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,970
the ECU and various other our cars are
no longer cars that are no longer

360
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,970
mechanical vehicles right there now
essentially

361
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,280
computer with wheels so the computer
control so much and you have so many

362
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,440
awesome features coming out our vehicles
like assisted park and all these things

363
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,030
if if there's something called assisted
park that is the vehicle the vehicle's

364
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,660
computer has controlled the wheel well
before it used to be simply mechanical

365
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:34,090
now to actually able to turn your real
so far has a very cool feature even iOS

366
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,928
and Android app so a friend of mine had
the same car he had he had on star and I

367
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:46,049
was playing with the Stephanies you can
play with my vehicle if you are so with

368
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:50,168
the app downloads are just cool stuff
let you see where your car is

369
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:55,890
lets you do a couple things there's a
key fob access you can lock you can

370
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,419
unlock remote start hit the horns and
lights I tried that a few times while he

371
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:05,650
was driving but they they fortunately
they don't allow you to activate the

372
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,040
warning lights while you're driving
which is that ok I'll check out this

373
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,470
communication I assume it's encrypted
with a cell so I installed my own CA you

374
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,490
know my own certificate authority on my
phone and ultimate the traffic you know

375
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,460
lo and behold it was encrypted I
installed the CIA and RI I usually have

376
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,860
my own sort of authority installed on my
on my mobile device and I started

377
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:36,399
sniffing and because I was using my own
CLK actually performed as a cell

378
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,340
man-in-the-middle attack again this is
only my own device I can't do this on

379
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,990
someone else's because they don't have
my certificate authority installed my

380
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,820
certificate authority tells my phone
that OC emmys you know house of cards CA

381
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,510
is a legitimate authority you can use
his key instead of the legitimate GM's

382
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:00,190
OnStar SSL key so once I decrypted the
traffic I thought you know

383
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,250
HPS request in plain text has also be 64
pulled out the base 64

384
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:10,970
and of course the password and username
right there like okay so make sure to

385
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,580
not use you know the answer app on a
network that you don't trust but as long

386
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,710
as as long as you don't have someone CA
they shouldn't be able to decrypt that

387
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,520
traffic and then I realized I had just
reset my phone I forgot like something

388
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,870
happened i reset it actually didn't have
my certificate authority installed which

389
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:36,399
means the app allowed an invalid
certificate authority to decrypt traffic

390
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,880
even though it had no recognition it had
no idea who Sammy's house of cards was

391
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:49,670
so the G EMAP was not looking at an SSL
CA it was blindly it will take accept

392
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:55,400
any SSL key that means as long as you
have someone on your wi-fi network which

393
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,500
is very easy to do and they open that
app you can decrypt all of their traffic

394
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:07,690
for that up I thought wow this is this
is absolutely insane how can exploit

395
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,690
this and I created a device with a
Raspberry Pi computer fun and yes I'm

396
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:19,280
bored Mallory which is open source of a
salmonella tax software some DNS

397
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,740
spoofing so that the user would actually
detect anything only took over

398
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,090
eighty-eight ign.com so anyone using
OnStar but all of their other traffic

399
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,090
would still continue to go through their
correct servers and practices all

400
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:35,760
certificates and a couple other things
like a wireless card and then I thought

401
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,240
ok how do I take my friend how are we
going to jump onto my network now

402
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,180
fortunately you can do things like you
can use your own or use common WiFi

403
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,680
network names like ATT wifi or Starbucks
things that you know that they may be on

404
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,710
but there's actually something pretty
cool here another thing that our phones

405
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:58,200
do is they sent out probe requests so if
your phone doesn't see your network it

406
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,090
will actually send out probe request
saying hey i'm looking for a network in

407
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,030
this case named to Darling is there a
network name to dog out here and you can

408
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,960
say yes it actually told you the network
name it's looking for and with that

409
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,810
information you can generate a network
on the fly which it will then join

410
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,260
assuming that the correct

411
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,420
work it's actually our phones are
devices are computers or laptops none of

412
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,890
them actually look at the MAC address
they're only looking at the network name

413
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,660
now this is only for open networks if if
your phone has only connected to

414
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,980
encrypted networks fortunately this
attack will not work but I'm assuming

415
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:40,160
almost everyone has at least connected
to one open encrypted network before ATT

416
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,070
wifi on almost all iPhones absolutely
Netgear Linksys I mean you can end the

417
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,710
cool thing is you can just launched all
of them died so if you come near my

418
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,680
house he may actually just see like 10
different network names for all the

419
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,630
common ones so with under $100

420
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:06,030
we have a little device that I threw
under my friends car and was able to you

421
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:12,480
know at some point she won't start this
is now called on star now so here I am

422
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,460
and what I acquired his credentials I
was then able to unlock his car remote

423
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:24,630
started and basically do anything to his
car that point and then I tested BMW

424
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,220
which also did not check SSL
certificates and I checked mercedes-benz

425
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,180
which is not check as all certificates
and then I tested Chrysler Jeep which

426
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,220
not yet test as a sort of gets this is a
matter of issue in virtually every I

427
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,500
think this was like five out of 10 of
the car apps that have the ability to

428
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,180
unlock a vehicle right now only cared
about the apps actually did something

429
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:53,650
you know important 5 of 10 did not
perform as a cell Ca validation so the

430
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,100
lessons here if your gonna do this
either validate certificates from the

431
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,459
CIA which actually I wouldn't
necessarily suggest any more than I see

432
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,460
my CA you can I turn off your keys if
they ever get stolen

433
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,470
there are a lot of certificate
authorities out there for example like I

434
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:12,779
don't know you wouldn't want the hong
kong you know post to be releasing CA's

435
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,320
releasing keys for you but they have
that full capability they can say they

436
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,389
own gmail.com if they want and we've
seen be seen CA's get back before or

437
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:27,179
accidental keys for gmail.com your
release before the better yet use

438
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,990
artifical pinning this way your

439
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:33,489
both the after you release has a key in
it you have that key those are the only

440
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:39,969
people who know about this key no one
else can you know avoid that also has

441
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:44,009
the passwords like don't just basically
for everything right hash your passwords

442
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,230
use assaults make it difficult even if
someone does obtain this information who

443
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,219
knows how someone will break into your
device sometime in the future there will

444
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:55,069
be new attacks the exact information in
different ways and always assume you are

445
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:01,500
hostile network just always assume that
so now we've broken into some cars will

446
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,680
go through this now there's another
interesting thing I've seen a lot of

447
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,660
these vehicles use and a lot to keep
rolling codes so wrong code is like we

448
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,740
talked about before with the CIA the
code exchanged every time kinda like two

449
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,899
FAA you get a different SMS message or
Google authenticator send you a

450
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,610
different number every time and that's
great that's actually a really good way

451
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,420
to prevent an attack like the key flow
like the garage door attack right Open

452
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,100
Sesame

453
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,970
where we have a fix code also rolling
codes are much much longer they're not

454
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,180
like silly 12 it goes that you can break
in a couple of seconds so that's a

455
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,140
that's a nice thing I quickly run
through some hardware attacks that if

456
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,009
you're ever looking at hardware that you
don't know some of the devices I was

457
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,710
looking at I was actually finding that
they would actually market the chip off

458
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,480
actually scratch off the name so you can
look up the datasheet and see what it

459
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,590
was using so in that case what I use is
a use a couple of things he's a logic

460
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,710
analyzer logic analyzer just look that
information with the digital information

461
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:06,730
going on a wire so you can connect pins
to each of these pens azz SMD microbes

462
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:13,470
microprobe act like really small really
small pants off of chips also use a

463
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,520
multimeter can measure voltage with a
multimeter of different different pins

464
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,800
on a chip and when i'm looking at a chip
that I don't know anything about mapping

465
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,830
now I can use a multimeter to find the
ground and define power so I can mark

466
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:31,470
all the ground and our parents also I
can use the logic analyzer and I can

467
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,600
look for certain things that look like a
clock signal Cox acknowledges that like

468
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,930
a square wave pulse width modulation
once I do that if I know what frequency

469
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,770
it it's communicating on which I should
be able to learn with something like an

470
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,400
idealist

471
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,200
er i can download all the data sheet I
can find for something that does not let

472
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,890
these communicate and 2.4 gigahertz
download all the data sheets of

473
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:57,049
transceivers on 2.4 gigahertz and I'll
take hold their pinout pages and I look

474
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,710
at them at all compared to any look
similar to what I have you any have the

475
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,180
same number of pins do any have the
grounds in the same places the voltage

476
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,089
in the same place as the clock in the
same place and if so I'm not discover

477
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,480
what chip that devices being used

478
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,000
despite them trying to you know scratch
it off using the logic analyzer

479
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,299
datasheet I can see how that chip is
communicating with the device what

480
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:22,369
command that sending then I'll learn all
sorts of other information like it bears

481
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:28,480
encryption I might learn a key I might
learn you know what what it's using I

482
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,529
can extract all the serial communication
how it communicates with that device and

483
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:40,630
I can then build an interception device
which is pretty fun so at this point

484
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,079
let's take a look at my car my car uses
something called ruling goes if you look

485
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,690
at this there's a ton more data in this
code so this would actually take years

486
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,809
and years and years to brute force and
it's only good ones so as soon as you

487
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,789
use this code it will never work again
so I hit the clicker on my car to unlock

488
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:04,410
that code is used in my car knows that
this code is no longer valid

489
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,808
which is great so let's understand how
ruling codes work is basically a random

490
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:13,720
number generator in your car and your
key and they're synced actually like a

491
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,939
rolling window when you press the unlock
button your car expects that unique

492
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,990
identifier that unique code but now that
the cars her tits as I will never accept

493
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,209
that again so if someone was sitting out
this Nicolas Cage's outside your home

494
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,569
and he likes this this identifier and he
tries to use it later on to replace its

495
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:34,210
not going to work because the cars as
i've seen that code before I will not

496
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,260
accept it I only accept the next code
and there's a rolling window so in case

497
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,450
you know in case the kids here in your
pocket and you get a bunch of times out

498
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,538
of range of the car then you go back to
the car the car will say oh you're

499
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:50,150
actually out of range but it's ok you
know you're on you're in the future

500
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,190
right you're not using a passcode you're
just a little bit in the future you

501
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,970
probably the next few times that's ok

502
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:01,209
now that's only a small window so it's
it's hard to use that to attack so

503
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,020
trying to find ways of replaying rolling
code of attacking that the only you know

504
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,420
the major way I could think of was the
only way is to capture signal while

505
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,700
you're out of range of the car so if you
like break into someone's house take

506
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,330
their car hit the bun record it and then
go back later and then replay it now

507
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,848
most cars these days also use this for
starting the vehicle as well so these

508
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:24,680
attacks are actually not only for
unlocking vehicles but it'll also

509
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,169
starting now this is really lame attack
I think if you're in the house and you

510
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:36,460
have access to Turkey should just take
it so how can we get around this what if

511
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:43,170
we jam jam the code now again these kids
are inexpensive so they don't charge you

512
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,190
like $300 by one but they're actually
really cheap so it's actually very easy

513
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,560
to interfere with this communication so
when someone hits their button if you're

514
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,640
actually transmitting as well in fact if
you can have the same dissimilar key and

515
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,740
you hold down the unlock or lock button
of your key while someone tries to

516
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,399
unlock their car they won't be able to
lock their car usually do this for kind

517
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,210
of a wide range it's kind of funny to
watch but you can basically easily

518
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,710
interfere with this communication so
worst case scenario they might have to

519
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,000
like pull out their key now he was hit
there but another key and it didn't work

520
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
once that happens right and you just did
it again and it typically works right

521
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,810
there was interference even hold long
enough so what if I jam just slightly

522
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:33,009
off just slightly off the frequency and
i also listen I also use a similar

523
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,390
device to listen I can actually be very
specific and listen to just that signal

524
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,670
and listen to their code and ignore my
Jimmy and I know where I'm jamming I can

525
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:46,349
ignore that the signal the problem is
once I've recorded that signal that the

526
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:51,099
car's not heard I can use that so I can
use to unlock however they're gonna keep

527
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:55,030
hitting it until it works and when it
works when the card does hear their

528
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,400
unlock code all previous codes get
disabled so the code that I've acquired

529
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,619
now no longer useful however as we're
human we all follow simple pattern if I

530
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:09,040
gym and I listened and I get one coat

531
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,640
and I keep jamming so you go to your car
you you've hit unlock it doesn't work

532
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,210
you had a lock again it doesn't work two
times in a row but I've listened to both

533
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,940
codes and I've extracted those two
passwords I now take those two and I

534
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:28,280
only replay the first one now the car
doesn't lock on the second time but I'm

535
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,990
using the first code so later on when
you go home and you lock your car I

536
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:38,919
still have an unused future code that I
can unlock your vehicle because there's

537
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,870
actually no timing right it's all about
just the order of the sequence of these

538
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:46,990
Co's so you can essentially trick the
user by playing the first one on their

539
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:53,560
second time and of course you can
automate this so this is an attack I

540
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,630
call roll jam have demonstrated with
about $30 and hardware and so many other

541
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,930
attacks in this area means such as I
think it's such an exciting area because

542
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,100
you have cars coming out this year in
2016 now actually communicate with other

543
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,220
vehicles on the road

544
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,870
VTV so there's so much other radio
communication that's gonna be happening

545
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:15,240
no cars are able to use ultrasound to
see if there's something in front of

546
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,180
them but what if you send your own
ultrasound right but we can generate

547
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,580
ultrasound it just sound at a higher
frequency what if you send that to a

548
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,700
vehicle you can make it believed that
someone is in front of you you can you

549
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,230
can send me occasional chorus thing that
oh it's it's really rainy so slow down

550
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,860
because make everyone slow down around
you do all sorts of stuff I'm it's crazy

551
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:38,210
it's scary and exciting there's still so
many other interesting attacks I was

552
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,600
also looking at my my car and I found
that they're locking the vehicle 13 Lok

553
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,770
Lok Lok and a record that data or
endorse interviewer that data will I

554
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,830
can't use a lock to like that's no good
account what what fun is locking their

555
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,400
car however I found in the signal as I
was looking at the data sheet I found

556
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,050
that the rolling code is one part and in
the command is a second part so I can

557
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,920
change the command from lock to unlock
and use the same code as long as I

558
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,440
jammed and they're locked command then I
can use that lock command to unlock even

559
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,380
though hit be a lot later wanna come
over I said I sent an unlocked just by

560
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,910
changing that bit because it's just a
commander not tied to the code and

561
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,420
anyway here's the devices

562
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,390
self attested on a lot of cars it
unlocked a lot of cars and it was

563
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,390
beautiful

564
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:36,069
lessons I mean you know encrypt ash
those buttons together so if you're

565
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:39,609
sending a lot command for example and of
course this this works anywhere this

566
00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:46,420
will work on http liked you should use
these same the same methods that encrypt

567
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,049
your house that communication together
right hash the key has the key with the

568
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:58,130
command use H max time based algorithms
there's actually something called I mean

569
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,200
we've had security for twenty years now
right

570
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,029
Zara seid RSA tokens which are
essentially two FAA that this for 20

571
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,970
years and every 2015 car I've attacked
has had this issue we can implement this

572
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,089
stuff the stuff exists we know about
these we know about these problems and

573
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:19,119
we know how to solve them to challenge
response with transceivers rather than

574
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,750
just cheap receivers so their ways of
fixing this and that's that's about it

575
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:30,170
that's that's what I have for you thanks
so much for coming enjoyed it and happy

576
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,170
to take any questions

577
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:49,319
what do they do that they all came out
with new routes

578
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,730
well the first 1 p.m. did not reach
reach out i mean it is impossible to

579
00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:00,010
contact them they had no like they had
no way for researchers to reach them so

580
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,960
I called them I want to support I asked
later emails went to their website I

581
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,910
mean literally never heard back and then
I then I released a demonstration and

582
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:16,078
release the code or anything and then I
got called you know within 24 hours and

583
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,070
then bands B&W etcetera they'll fix
everything everyone fix it within a few

584
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,079
days which is great because it's an app
update yes

585
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,950
none of them had none of them had been
programs or in another security presence

586
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,919
is that I could actually communicate
with his literary I mean literally all

587
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,049
these companies I had to just they had
no security response right this is a new

588
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:52,670
areas of these vehicles now GM's does
now jim does have a security program I'm

589
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,400
sure they do

590
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
yes

591
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,740
correct

592
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,190
because so this is this is the device
actually a new device that created that

593
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:23,240
smaller and cheaper than $30 and you put
it under their cars so it always has

594
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,049
been Xcode yeah so you just it literally
they have to press the button twice

595
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,970
every time and we had a pretty quickly
we just get used to it right now just

596
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:44,000
hit it twice the second time every time
that's a great idea actually you could

597
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,700
do that so you only did greens than one
that's a good point that correct many

598
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:59,109
many feel that you actually see the
lifelike happen to know thanks for

599
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,110
coming

600
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,470
questions yes

601
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:24,029
attacks really interesting right a lot
of us have keys that we keep in our

602
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,640
vehicles keeping our pocket and we can
go up to our carpool the door and it'll

603
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,089
send a signal out that are key to text
and then it will perform a challenge

604
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:37,510
response back right and for starting the
car it actually use the signal strength

605
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,880
so it knows that you're in the car so
the signal strength is too low it says

606
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,430
oh you're out of the car magnets are the
vehicle had to be inside the car but as

607
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:49,310
you say you can perform the implication
attack we actually have two people right

608
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,950
and you go up to the car you pull the
door it sends the signal your device

609
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,970
amplifies that signal or sends it
wirelessly somewhere else that gets

610
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:02,939
retransmitted near the door or near the
near the persons car key in a restaurant

611
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,590
or outside of their house and yeah you
can then unlock and start their vehicle

612
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,380
and drive away in vehicles cannot stop
if they detect the key is no longer in

613
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,100
the car would be too dangerous right if
you're on the freeway is what happens so

614
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,100
the car will continue going to take it
you're tops up

615
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:36,380
that's correct all of them do have some
amount of timing but its lacks enough

616
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,380
that you can perform the attack in every
case that i've seen

617
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:49,339
yes yes

618
00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:13,769
know the same company attack yeah yeah
yeah

619
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:25,690
absolutely i mean I feel like I think
we're talking about earlier like this is

620
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,000
the web 10 years ago right ten fifteen
years ago everything out excess as

621
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,099
everything else equal

622
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:37,980
school I everything had RFI now most
things and see what I and our high so I

623
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,799
think in another 10 years hopefully
we'll have a lot more hardware and radio

624
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,000
security so I i suspect well yeah

625
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:10,180
I don't think they have security people
I think it's a new thing right

626
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:27,530
interesting very cool

627
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:42,400
okay well thanks so much everyone
