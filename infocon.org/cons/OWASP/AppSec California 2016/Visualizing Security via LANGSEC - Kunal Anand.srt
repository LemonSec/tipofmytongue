1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:31,409
like this I don't have this is why I
don't think so

2
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:55,900
sitcom but also said it was business
applications and others experience

3
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:18,970
working with all sorts of novel drugs
for a nice guys however by seized from

4
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,970
jail

5
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:59,160
and will do so and you want to show he
was saying it was just getting to talk

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:13,180
to the gym here to sign it also that how
he thinks security so BBC's recently

7
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:38,450
very large so basically I'm working and
then I started down the road from here

8
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:49,890
security so we're going to talk about so
it was a little bit more about it

9
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:57,970
there's a lot of great research today
said she will love it is actually walk

10
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:22,200
through job creation I said they also bc
it is all we're gonna do as low as loud

11
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:35,929
as their basis

12
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,330
Ortiz

13
00:03:43,090 --> 00:04:17,209
we're seeing all sorts of people will
see that but that's because

14
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:45,260
or anything that kind of interesting
ones

15
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:33,280
security forces graduations and also so

16
00:05:48,060 --> 00:06:26,800
we go to work at a time like nothing
reach is so it's important for people to

17
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:43,510
head outside

18
00:06:44,980 --> 00:07:16,220
640 thinking about what is everyone in
the business or whatever so often we

19
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:28,970
address the word bird

20
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:53,750
hope that this is all we know is why not
just get a series and it is nice here

21
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:25,880
and you remember the ball with you
because you realize what ya

22
00:09:36,590 --> 00:10:08,730
second security security or likes this
is a little about it and he

23
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:50,350
something like what you guys are you
looking to do stories so as to how it

24
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,440
works like 80

25
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:23,330
and also reducing thinking about using
rights low stress so beautiful it that

26
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:57,260
way so this is here and you can see it
seems you just heard this is the world's

27
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,810
most this was actually

28
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:15,980
see what exactly everything
