1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:27,839
so I meant to sorrow the CTO of
infinitive I also work at Pearson I have

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,460
a talk he recalled taking up that 211
and it's going to be a talk about how

3
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,730
this is actually ironic and there's a
good sort of silver lining to some bad

4
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,360
that happened this time last year this
time last year at a death in the family

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,940
had to cancel my presentation but I was
gonna say you should do this and this

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,720
year there wasn't enough the family I'm
here and I can say I did this and here's

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,570
the results so little bit of silver
lining every list last night this is

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,059
kind of cool I'm not going to tell you
that you should still work I can say I

9
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:59,169
did this and this is how it works for me
I'm still think you should do it at

10
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,199
least now I have some numbers let's talk
about getting things to 11 so anybody

11
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,880
know who this guy is 40 s Henry Ford
right he was the guy who said you know

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,810
what this handcrafting car think it's
kind of cool everybody likes a

13
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,310
handcrafted car but we can't really make
a lot of them and that sounds to me a

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,409
lot like absolute great this handcrafted
testing is cool and it's very thorough

15
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,850
and it's awesome I've done lots of it
and it's very productive but it's slow

16
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,830
and it doesn't scale and appears that we
have I don't know the numbers of refunds

17
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,420
eat somewhere between 1200 and 2000 apps
and about 5,000 developers and right now

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,580
we have 10 people right so those numbers
don't argue for handcrafting in fact

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,890
they say you can't the smoke anything we
need to get out of that of the business

20
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,640
so I want to talk about how you can take
your application security program in

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,140
reply develops agile that kind of
thinking to it and get basically a

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,740
assembly line in your absolute program
really start churning out some numbers

23
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,729
hopefully what I did at Pearson and it's
been very successful work of the golden

24
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,120
children of this is our group which is
nice so this is how we're going to take

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
her up so I can get it to 11 had to use
the spinal temperate forests that just

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,569
as you can't not have the spinal cord
injury but I'll have reference please up

27
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,988
good I'm getting older I had an intern
when I was at Rackspace who had been a

28
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,110
live shorter than my marriage

29
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,970
222 I get married too young but it was
still like omg this is why all of my

30
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,070
references you just don't get you can
delete this plate left haha so luckily

31
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,079
this one work hallelujah another strong
recommendation if you haven't done it

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,200
already go out and buy this book and
read it

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,119
1 it will annoy you actually recommended
this at another conference and somebody

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,790
came up to me than the second day it
said I got no sleep last night you

35
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,660
expletive I Amazon that book and I
started reading in a bit or 32 I am

36
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,380
sorry to tell you this conference is
over and start reading it I did that I

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,829
stayed up too late against fantastic
book great-great-great but can't

38
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,580
recommend it to us but I took some of
the stuff I read this book and some

39
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,200
other things just in my life and try to
wrap them into what we did it at Pearson

40
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,000
talked about is the three ways of death
go through the skies it's a fictional

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,709
story of this guy's work with I T and
how he did develop some kind of change

42
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:29,380
from a very dysfunctional I T operations
situation to a very functional one and

43
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,380
in this past week of theirs as kind of
the guy who got some and they talk about

44
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,609
the three ways of democrats I'm gonna
talk about three ways of DevOps and how

45
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,040
they relate to application security so
the first one is work flu and this is

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,450
just quickly critically it's looking at
your purpose and what you sir for your

47
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,048
business and how to do it like the best
what processes what do you do that

48
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,030
actually aids your reason for the
business paying your salary that's your

49
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,880
workflow and the other thing that just
as a blue background of develops the

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,359
other thing they talk about is working
from left to right working from the

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,930
business through development ops 2
finally a customer that's working left

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,610
or right and then the flow where the
flow rate you'll hear talked about a lot

53
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,799
of double-talk stuff that's the speed at
which you can move things from a

54
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,440
business idea all the way up to a
customer right that's the flow so if I

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,140
use these terms I want to make sure I
sort of level set before we get too deep

56
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,550
into it so we're actually this is that
first of the three ways in there sort of

57
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,360
three key concepts are each that needs
to be repeatable right you want to

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,090
accept almost be it's easy button right
to use another cliche you want an easy

59
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,070
button the way we do apprentice like
this could be done

60
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,950
assistant never pass on defects or
absent defects or false positives right

61
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,250
if you are simply running you know God
help you scan and print PDF heading it

62
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,230
off you're just begging to be automated
with some scripting right and I'm not

63
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,720
sure your value and is to the business
right like I could probably teach my 12

64
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,770
year old son click Next four times and
print PDF like this is not really value

65
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,770
of a business and the local
optimizations with the global view you

66
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,490
have to make sure that what you're
fixing this is more particularly when

67
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,040
you're working on the workflow of your
group in your group being in my case the

68
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,170
upset team at Pearson if you look at
that works will understand that you

69
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,310
can't fix something that then marries
another part of the process where you

70
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,070
need to make sure that when you speed up
individual things and I'll talk to this

71
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,860
was for specific examples but when
you're speeding a particular things they

72
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,520
can't then barry they will inevitably be
pushing bottlenecks around right you'll

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,609
fix one bottle that you'll find the next
one but you have to have a global view

74
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,400
you cannot go so fast you bury some
other part of the business so let's talk

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,210
about pipelines and figure out your
workflow what we really want is we want

76
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,510
customers but fast that's really what we
want and everyone's probably been to

77
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,570
Chipotle or its fully equipped land and
that is pretty much custom but fast

78
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,140
right you have a limited menu selection
but you can kind of mix-and-match ala

79
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,900
carte he went to put the burrito or your
goal or whatever you want to be your

80
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,580
choice this is what we want what we want
to be able to go down and started the

81
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,930
line and say well this is kind of this
much risk in its kind of this important

82
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,750
to the business and it is as much users
so they need this this this but they

83
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,060
don't be there in the one extra
guacamole

84
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,200
whatever we need to be able to do that
for Absa so I my solution for this is

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,729
what I'm calling out sick pipeline in
particular for Pearson we really

86
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,640
concentrated on making the team as
functional as possible we're just now

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,419
getting to where we're integrating more
of an external teams and near to his

88
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,370
honestly year one we had didn't have our
house in order so it was much more

89
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,169
important for me to get our house in
order before I started to try to

90
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,620
interact with external

91
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,110
Pearson so this is really focused making
our Absa Group lean mean and functional

92
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,699
so here's an example of an absolute
pipeline the one that we implemented at

93
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,910
Pearson so we have a basic requests
coming into the process you sent to a

94
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,600
particular email address and our case it
goes into this afternoon services

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,520
request repository this is what I tend
to call the intake position when you

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,948
have a triage right you're having a
request coming in I need to figure out

97
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,740
what to do with them that's the triage
where we're using some orchestration is

98
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,160
actually a generic one orchestration
orchestra using Stack storm we might

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,060
provisions in particular security
services you might kick off a threat

100
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,280
model if it's a variety of risk you may
do manual assessments will have some

101
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,750
kind of collection have a laser pointer
on this and yes I do have some kind of

102
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,530
collection of security tools you can
automate the middle and run those and

103
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,250
other results you want to dump those
into some sort of central rise

104
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,330
centralized repository to keep track of
all of the results in one single place

105
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,099
you have one source of truth hopefully
you're going to put those out to a

106
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,320
defect tracker and if we're all lucky
someday will live in a perfect world

107
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,260
we're reporting is dead and we just do
bugs is right for a sec I think that's

108
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,460
what they should be that's a def talk
it's a bug where the security bug I hate

109
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,620
writing reports I have no problem doing
book trackers are issues an issue

110
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,800
trackers but also from the same single
source of truth you can pump out metrics

111
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,510
you can talk to GRC tools like RSA
Archer whatever you want right and

112
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,099
that's what we kind of cool to deliver
and while we work through this process

113
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:29,360
in 2015 we sort of started we actually
started on the on the intake in the

114
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,959
deliver a portion of it first and we
don't have the end and then just give it

115
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,429
a rating right we started early with
their first release in March so let's

116
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,589
talk about key features of an absent
pipeline if your gonna do this thing it

117
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,350
is definitely designed for internal
improvement like i just mentioned it's

118
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,000
never done it's always made better we
always find that one thing that's a bit

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,300
of a paper cut let's fix that out of
this thing is slow

120
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,910
let's fix that were burning too much
time there let's fix their you just keep

121
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,089
going and it's never really done

122
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,620
but it does provide I think this is a
crucial thing or reusable path RefSeq

123
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,329
activities right as we're talking about
where X is in the pipeline we have

124
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:12,790
really well known to find states so it's
really easy to kind of understand across

125
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,420
the team in particular and even now it's
getting out outside of our team within

126
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,709
Pearson of where absolute oh you're in
this stage or in the state and now it's

127
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,529
kind of become a common vernacular we
can speak clearly about what's going on

128
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,329
it does provide a clear and consistent
process for the team and our

129
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,149
constituencies much like that thing I
just said if you understand the states

130
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,970
of these apps are gonna go on as you go
from left to right now our

131
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,290
constituencies starting to actually talk
back to us in that same language like

132
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,240
that Dave managers are saying oh I'm
here ok great we both know if there's a

133
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,999
common language which has been huge we
have a one-way flow with well-defined

134
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,839
States we don't ever sort of go
backwards right you just go through the

135
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,990
system if we need to do a retest we
start over and we started the beginning

136
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,540
to take an intake can we push them
through get right there's no sort of

137
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,389
stopping the factory lines while they're
sort of this but not really we're

138
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,420
relying heavily on automation I'll talk
through a bunch of ways we're doing that

139
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,729
we've grown organically over time and
the ideal goal is to gracefully in turn

140
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,730
it into gracefully interconnect with the
death process so in our case that's

141
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,929
primarily geraldo left you guys have
more than one app team you probably have

142
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:24,749
more than one bloody issue tracker it's
primarily Gerald we have some others

143
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,059
that were not working on integrating
with so little we have a finding will

144
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,600
bundle one or more findings together and
make a security bug in JIRA for the

145
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,769
team's right that's how we do reporting
and that's our integrated with the teens

146
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,699
we actually have numbers I don't think I
put him in here what was it was a 40%

147
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:46,649
decrease in time to fix for those apps
that we have juror integration with

148
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:49,759
versus still during the traditional PDF
got all help you

149
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,939
reporting so we thought market increased
because I used to be a developer you

150
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,410
hand me a hundred pages pdf illegal
that's cute when it dropped some gonna

151
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,910
move on i dont read that thing I don't
understand that thing right it's the

152
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,719
mess so like where we've chilled that
that ugliness it's actually been

153
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,690
significantly productive

154
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,720
actual one so this is what we have
appeared about that there was a generous

155
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,820
lied I misspoke earlier so if incoming
service request we wrote an open source

156
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,860
to add majengo based at the whole bag of
holding you can get off to get home I

157
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,380
think of a link later that is basically
are where we track all the incoming

158
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,480
activities who's on what we assign stuff
we know how many engagements we having

159
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,730
going on for Pearson the idea of
engagement is a bucket to hold one or

160
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,500
more security activities so that could
be you're getting a manual assessment

161
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,920
and a scan and we're running check marks
against you or whatever it is I those

162
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,540
will get put into a bucket of an
engagement we track them there are using

163
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,410
Stack storm do a bunch of orchestration
I'll have some examples of this in a few

164
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,640
slides from there were going to our
slate O'Toole's who are we have check

165
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:08,500
marks veracode used purposely Whitehead
IBM's scale and quality I have had some

166
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,170
people ask why so many tools will some
of them

167
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,540
electric Wallace there's a different
department that actually paid for Qualys

168
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,130
and they have their web applications
candor there wa s thing so why not we'll

169
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,700
take those feeds it right we didn't buy
it people are running it we can grab

170
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,730
this feeds off and stick it a threat fix
which is our one source of truth why not

171
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,520
have that extra information so that's
what we do

172
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,160
rhetoric like i just mentioned that's a
single source of truth right a

173
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,189
vulnerability doesn't exist appears
unless it's in 36 and everything we do

174
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,000
even manual assessments all under
control

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,030
6501 like I said we have a single source
of truth but more importantly I can pull

176
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,530
metrics consistently for all of our apps
from that one place we can put things

177
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,449
into JIRA we can chill false positives
all that stuff happens and throat fix

178
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,320
and once we get archer actually working
will put stuff in order to let someone

179
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
else's problem I have to go to work and
yes sir

180
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:14,750
gotchu

181
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,610
Justin some cases we're not perfect with
that that's that's action area were

182
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,330
trying to improve this year if we're
manually closing them and the person who

183
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,500
closes them has their smart how they
will go back and you know we case like a

184
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,480
check marks profile for doing a scam
that's mostly how we're doing them now

185
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,420
like 14 people with check marks is a
good example actually remember people

186
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,250
check marks we will run into initial
scan with them with a kind of a

187
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,140
high-touch scan right from the first can
look at it will review it kill some

188
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,860
false positives that scam profile again
a reasonable scam profile we actually

189
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,140
don't hold the application owners
responsible for the check marks findings

190
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,810
until they get to where they're going to
do like what would be like you a or pre

191
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,420
prod work but we set them up when they
start so you have this sort of window of

192
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,810
time between when we set up check marks
and when we're actually

193
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,370
your pre prod that they can run as much
as they want their getting results were

194
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,660
filtering false positives and that gives
them away to sort of warm up and for us

195
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,579
honestly to have the the lead time to
run a couple scans and tune them

196
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,480
significantly to miss this weekend right
to get rid of those false positives will

197
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
mark fuhrman threat fix if they've made
it through the thing where were hurting

198
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,280
is we don't have a good way to capture
those markers false-positive in check

199
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,290
marks were from scanner scam that say
and then to flag who did that skin and

200
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,000
then tell them go to make this setting
to that I'm saying that is the gap that

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,360
we're trying to close this year so it's
it's basically if people remember to do

202
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,920
it gets done and I don't trust people to
remember to do it so we're working on

203
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,060
being able to pull metrics out of threat
fix to say hey we took the

204
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,199
false-positive this app using this
scanner and this guy did it or gal did

205
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,660
it now let's go back and have them
adjust the profile we don't have that

206
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,279
yet that's what we're working towards
doesn't make sense

207
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:36,189
policy this camp like to say this is a
false positive don't report it for this

208
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:40,899
app anymore and we do that when we
remember to be honest with you that's

209
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,610
where we are now I'm trying to get it so
we can find one we don't remember start

210
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,420
pointing fingers and that's why we don't
have so it's it's hit or miss now to be

211
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,579
totally honest with you i'd say we're
pretty good about it because we usually

212
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,969
do a lot of hand-holding particularly
with the static noise she at first so

213
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,120
those false positives get kind of
figured it out in that initial like

214
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,180
let's first can let's look at them are
they say no we got these things are

215
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,469
ridiculous let's turn those off usually
those those profiles a scanner profiles

216
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,850
get tweaked pretty well there were
really missing it is in some of the

217
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,360
dynamics of my cat scan getting that
profile down and sort of hardened good

218
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,360
as tricky as another question

219
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,209
2000 apps that answer is everywhere from
like once a week Tues every six months

220
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:33,839
to twice a year I mean it's it is so all
over the place I hate to answer that

221
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:43,809
question yes there's one in eighty that
does that the space the names on the

222
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,529
other they're very aggressive develop
shop so they're probably remember their

223
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,639
numbers cuz I don't actually work
directly with them but they're in that a

224
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:58,679
couple times a week range yes it gets
very tight and for those I had more of

225
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,620
those actually when I worked at
Rackspace and for those a lot of times

226
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,630
we would set this idea of like the
cadence of us can and they made me they

227
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,140
may put make three pushes the prod in
between our window of being able to look

228
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,140
and tell

229
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:22,150
exactly exactly yet and then we just
gonna try to tie it up as best we can

230
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,720
with then maybe they do three pushes to
prod before we get back to them but

231
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,430
that's just how it works

232
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:34,630
yeah and at least if they're pushing
that quick the fixes go quick to attract

233
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,990
that was amazing we this guy was doing a
test is on IRC with the new there on

234
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,000
this one project and he fell in issues
that have an issue as proof break he

235
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,400
keeps testing during an IRC hey it's
fixed it's like what is yet to fix the

236
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,900
problem

237
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,830
ok retest yet is gone we open and close
the book before even finish the

238
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:05,699
engagement like it was done in fact it's
all right if they do a hotfix absolutely

239
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
yes

240
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:26,870
mostly right now we're interacting with
the developers through yes I mean with

241
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,309
some sanity we can

242
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,658
bility to take these 10 cross-site
scripting and push them is 186

243
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:36,220
cross-site scripting the things you can
kind of group individual findings to

244
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,200
make sense if you find ten things that
doesn't necessarily relate to 10 bugs

245
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,789
but yeah that's that's the right now our
window with developers were this year

246
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,370
working on actually getting into more
build pipelines and also an example of

247
00:18:50,370 --> 00:19:00,158
the latter two yes there's a scheduled
job happens at 2 a.m. or something like

248
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,549
that that's it looks at all of its known
JIRA issues and tootsies for a change in

249
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,639
status that was open yesterday was
closed today on market closed here and

250
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:12,498
now we can to take that change in threat
fix and schedule a retest of it's

251
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,879
warranted or whatever

252
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:31,678
yes there's the whole CMDB that's a
separate group that we interface with in

253
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,029
here right now just beginning getting an
interface saying to be quite honest with

254
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:41,200
you they do stuff via email and we hate
email and I think we've beat them enough

255
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,789
that they're gonna API fight so I'm
happy to work with that right now we'd

256
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,279
like gather up emails and ship them to
them

257
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,269
these are the things that had these
problems and you know we just saw Jen

258
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:57,340
emails which is awful but that's what
we've got right now unfortunately we

259
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,110
don't control those that are you gonna
give an email interface all genuine

260
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,918
email but I'm not gonna like a perfect
so this is how we're interacting with

261
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,769
some of the dev team's a little bit now
it could be gall it could be anything

262
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:15,549
you want right as part of their normal
develops build pipeline where this year

263
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,240
in particular starting to wire in tests
into their build pipelines that are

264
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,200
particularly by biases for low
false-positive hi you no assurance that

265
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,440
it actually is a real issue is I don't
want to have to Jen more false positives

266
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,750
but as we're doing customers testing

267
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,110
for security in their bill pipelines
were shipping them now over into either

268
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,280
will usually stuck storm because it does
a great bit of inventive venting and we

269
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,700
can take it from stock storm and dumped
into threat fix so this and says

270
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,520
whatever now we're starting it added to
build pipelines that aren't sort of

271
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,000
these separate outside the normal day of
spectrum those are getting moved into

272
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,760
our same pipeline and we've got a couple
POC is going on now and will do this

273
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:06,030
more through the course of 2016 as
private in a couple of the POC cases and

274
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,560
we have a couple it's such a range oh my
god we have such a range we have stuff

275
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,300
there's always killing on Amazon and we
have ten year old twenty year old

276
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,560
classic ASP so like I hate to make
concrete statements because we have the

277
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,050
range but for those progressive ones
that are actually develop shops and have

278
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,250
these kind of build pipelines yessir
started to peel Sizwe bundle in a couple

279
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:31,290
very kind of very specific testing that
that then can shoot into our pipeline

280
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,290
and get out of the process

281
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:46,539
to be under bluntly honest with you
would normally get up we haven't even

282
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:50,039
met with those old guys because they're
just hard to do I mean like I'm not

283
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,090
worried about doing a lot built on a
mission for those guys yet cuz I got so

284
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,908
many other people that have build
automation already that I need to chew

285
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,840
through before look at those old guys
I'm imagining hopefully if God smiles

286
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:09,760
upon me some old guys will die wondering
the new guys hoping for will see that's

287
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,230
that's kind of our work for this year's
to try to get into more build pipelines

288
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,340
that we got our stuff together for our
group an hour trying to reach into

289
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,350
doesn't even earlier upstream which is
one of the reasons why we concentrated

290
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,928
on static as well because it's much more
early early still see stage oh I love

291
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,600
the school by damming up spending time
optimizing anything other than the

292
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,070
critical resources an illusion right you
have to find that one bottleneck that's

293
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,210
really holding you back and optimize act
as if you don't do that you're just

294
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,380
creating a bigger

295
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,289
either running a system driver creating
a bigger cue in front of whatever the

296
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:48,419
real bottleneck is so for me it's the
personnel and absent that are really the

297
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,850
critical resource raised her hand in
here if you have too many absent people

298
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,250
and you wish they'd all go away right
leg Ogino hands right ratios will never

299
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,010
be in our favor so what do we do about
that like I'm trying to and we're trying

300
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,179
to automate everything that doesn't work
are you human brain and actually myself

301
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:13,149
and another person on the team went
medal for pretty much all of 2015 and

302
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:17,189
just wrote tooling to make our guys go
faster that's all I did last year I

303
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,679
didn't know assessments whatsoever it
was all tooling consulted work but

304
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,159
really made it a work was like what can
I write and automate and script and set

305
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,080
up so that a handy guy everything he
needs to start his testing right done or

306
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,539
how can I get results

307
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:36,320
you know to convert from one format to
so they go on to threaten all just works

308
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,750
right that was all of my work in another
guys work last year this is an awesome

309
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,830
consistencies way up we have an awesome
ability to track her work status which

310
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,040
has been really fantastic when you get
the

311
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,600
hey it's you know this important
marketing thing is going to launch today

312
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,250
I want to drop everything and get this
assessed right away we're like cool now

313
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,620
because everything's in bed holding I
could say that's great if you gonna take

314
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,489
these three people off with the working
on now we're not gonna do these other

315
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,830
things are you cool with that we can
actually have conversations about the

316
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,780
cost of those decisions accurately with
management and that's been a huge boon

317
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,889
to us his debut in 2000 that other
things really important to win so that

318
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,090
all lately but one guy on this cool we
can do that and we have metrics and we

319
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,280
can tell you all manual semantics but we
check marks on loading takes a day

320
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,720
whatever is right we can tell you how
long these things take over track team

321
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,890
but its all them bigger holding

322
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,580
we've definitely increase the workflow
through the system I some numbers in a

323
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,510
minute

324
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,950
fuel increased visibility metrics so
much so that I'm probably gonna spend

325
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,770
the first half of this year during the
more metrics automation cos it's almost

326
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,220
like crack like we actually started
giving metrics out of here like Tommy

327
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,040
what more can you slice it this way what
about that in my line of business and i

328
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,290
wanna buy the top 10 most scary absent
were a slice and dice and all sorts of

329
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,159
different ways so really this first half
of 2016 for me is going to be doing tons

330
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,160
of metrics and doing things I think able
to have dust warding invasive people can

331
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,190
sort of all occurred serve themself
metrics because we've been producing

332
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,050
them on a usually a monthly or quarterly
cadence and then handing them out what

333
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,159
they want them like now now so I'm gonna
give away to get them now and they get

334
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,580
them now I don't give them to them and
this is definitely reduce the deafening

335
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,740
friction without seconds been fantastic
particularly the jury thing has been

336
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,600
great that's if you're not doing that
now like work on that big time that's

337
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,300
huge huge huge bonus so it's not
integrate this is the first impression

338
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,190
and if you think about the apps coming
into the team right it's gonna be an

339
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,260
existing app it might be a brand new app
it might be eight they previously tested

340
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,080
after words an application who's had
findings that need to be retested those

341
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,949
are the four big categories of
absolutely came up with and one of the

342
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,290
things we've done our service request as
we ask for data what's so if you are a

343
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,409
new apt we've never seen before we go
say what are you what your platform are

344
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,940
you you know your job your JBoss or
whatever let's get all that metadata

345
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,890
about you that kind of makes our job a
little bit easier

346
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,460
and we'll ask you the first time the
next time you come back to bed holding

347
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,670
an ask so who are you know I'm this app
will say oh you told us last time you

348
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,610
are Java and JBoss and because the old
system was asking the same metadata

349
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,919
questions every single time it was
driving the PM's crazy cuz I like the 40

350
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,750
questions right when we actually a
little bit of clever tailoring of

351
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,190
questions to what the f is as well so we
kind of dynamically do that instead of

352
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,520
having the laundry list by committee of
questions for the app developers are the

353
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:40,200
PM's usually yeah we dropped the absence
of different categories based on what

354
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,570
they are we have the fortier risk system
at Pearson drop them into based on that

355
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,470
metadata and then the middle or the
testing area where r you we're using

356
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,520
stuck talking to do a lot of eventing
like I said I've got two more slides on

357
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,800
that later and then we just kind of
these tests what we did is we created

358
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,930
four tiers based on risk and some other
criteria and based on your tier you get

359
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,520
more or less of this middle right if
you're an internal app that five people

360
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,480
use and we really don't care about you
you may only get the abscam once a year

361
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,890
and we're done with you don't matter if
you're the high-profile app that we're

362
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,520
doing a major launched on everyone's
looking at you get the full gamut and

363
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,480
Emmanuel test model and the whole nine
right just depends but allows us to ala

364
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,950
carte all of these men really 2016 for
us is gonna be doing even more work

365
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,740
about handing in automating and doing
better profiling of the abscam that's an

366
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,010
area where we're still fairly manual
high getting a decent abscam profile is

367
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,890
usually a runner to was some tweaking
and then you have a reusable good

368
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:45,240
profile for that happen in say whatever
the two lists the nice thing

369
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,760
paralyzed all the stuff right we can
whatever tools we need to do we can run

370
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,690
them they they're all realisable all the
stuff is designed to revert encode to

371
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,680
take the results and dump them directly
into 360 the minute they finish we have

372
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,210
the results there's no sort of waiting
or make sure you upload just gotta make

373
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,140
that joke with the exception of
obviously manual testing have to manage

374
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,250
uploading go figure in the focus is
release is our focus particularly on the

375
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:11,950
tooling

376
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,769
the last year was on set up I want
everything setup is easy as possible

377
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,679
from rivers actually doing that activity
right so if you're doing a manual test I

378
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,360
will hand you the URL the creds if
you're allowed or not to do pre prod

379
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,658
prod when the testing window is I'll
give you all the meditator you need as a

380
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,100
tester to know when and how you start
testing rights you enough to come in and

381
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,799
ask the p.m. want to buy point of
contact all that junk is handed to you

382
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,799
as one unit as part of the test yet

383
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,230
right now we don't do any of that

384
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:58,250
well the only interaction is we get
blessing or not to tell certain

385
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,759
environments like you can test broad you
can't just brought you can't SQL you can

386
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,860
test your way right we have those kind
of things but actually setting up and

387
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,860
maintaining those is the application
owners problem

388
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:36,670
yes that's actually when it imports and
it's in the next line but I go into 1036

389
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,540
will normalize them into a five point
higher critical high medium and low

390
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:50,399
whatever but it has an ability to filter
and say I think the info for CWE 75 from

391
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,340
check marks it says it's a high I think
it's a low and you can actually tweak

392
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,770
those custom by scanner type in so you
can sort of nudge them into the

393
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:08,690
criticality you believe they should be
not with the Skinner says not with the

394
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,250
manuals because of the i mean they're
they're literally Emanuel upload so

395
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,190
there's not a way to do that but there
there are guys if they really are off

396
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,190
the reservation I hope that's not a
problem

397
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,970
yeah

398
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:37,279
that's a great idea but no not just
everything in the CWE eases its you know

399
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,139
lingua franca for vulnerabilities
insider threat fix and then like it like

400
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,240
I said it does the normalization of the
you know critical info and then we can

401
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,779
nudge them but we lose that that's a
great that's a great thing yet adding

402
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:57,429
the CSS like environmental and all those
other factors into threat fix that you

403
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,830
can actually have that carry through
that's great we have a denim person the

404
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,178
back maybe we'll talk to them about that
later

405
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:10,750
that's a great great idea little bit and
then that this is just about integrating

406
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,460
with others in this is really are our
work for this year is taking the results

407
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,049
from different build pipelines and every
sort of talked about this pushing

408
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,490
directly into threat fix using things
like all other automated tools US allies

409
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:26,009
what have you to to run them actually in
the build process and then ship those

410
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,009
just back into our pipeline right yes

411
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,169
we haven't seen before

412
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,789
talk about later we have a chat but that
we use so we're doing some of the the

413
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:58,799
chat up see stuff haven't seen that yet
to be totally honest with you

414
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:14,879
Jenkins his way we've been integrated as
we just run normal you know red green

415
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:19,399
and then then we have a little bit of
glucose the ship those into our pipeline

416
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:24,539
and a threat facing go they still have
access to it we don't really the big key

417
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,350
is we don't hold them accountable until
later on in this deal see they can get

418
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,340
early results and then choose when they
want to act upon them as is our is a

419
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,959
real in goal and we're not gonna perfect
with it we're doing a pretty good job

420
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,190
and obviously you go to tools that make
sense for your order and then the

421
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,570
deliver section of the pipeline the tail
end of it right this is were using

422
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,960
threat fix their source of truth is I've
talked about it does dee dubin

423
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,789
consolidate findings which is super
super handy so if AB scan and zap find

424
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:58,710
the same cross-site scripting that's one
finding not too much nice reduces the

425
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,769
numbers of reporting it does
normalization of the scanner info which

426
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:08,009
is really does for metrics as I can
upload normalize stuff i mean it like we

427
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:12,710
talked about earlier pushes it pushes
issues in a bug trackers it has a REST

428
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,799
interface I wrote some go cold guilty of
client those guys at Pearson wrote a

429
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,330
Python library to talk to the rest
interface it's a fairly same resting her

430
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,158
face was quite nice like automation with
red flags is pretty easy to do right and

431
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,950
this is where we touch point with a lot
of different teams where this is where

432
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,870
the metrics for the sizzle Oregon their
monthly meetings the death groups get

433
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,840
their different metrics pushed out on a
monthly or quarterly basis all this kind

434
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,480
of happens in the in the delivery
portions of this is sort of the intake

435
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,590
is where they first see SNL the delivery
such as we're actually interacting with

436
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:51,889
their sort of constituencies so why do
we like absolute pipelines well they'd

437
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:55,969
allow us super super super visibility
into work in progress through something

438
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,330
that I've really had in the various
shops that have been

439
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,750
like we know if I log into both my VPN
login double I could tell you these

440
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,730
people are working on these things right
now here before we have queued yourself

441
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,909
busy this guy is here's what's scheduled
for next week it's all there

442
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:13,629
laid out very neatly so that's fantastic

443
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,760
we've been able to sort of get some
reasonable numbers on how long it takes

444
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,849
to do these things which I i mean I'm
doing this for a while I can from I hit

445
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,129
give you an idea what they are but we
actually of real numbers which is nice

446
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:30,060
particularly real numbers that we're
working after statistical static test as

447
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,199
acceptor Lawrence consistency is through
the roof it's crazy

448
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
we've been able to reallocate people
very easily now because like I said

449
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,599
those costs decisions can be replaced
with management ok you want everybody on

450
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,280
this that's great but these things are
gonna get done are you call it that

451
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,450
right now we can actually have a
conversation accurately as well define

452
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,618
and it's been flexible if we have a
range of people in our team from some

453
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,910
very senior people to some very junior
people and we can kind of plug them in

454
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,670
where they fit which is also good
because unfortunately I'm sure you guys

455
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,460
don't have all senior people right you
have people that are learning of people

456
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,770
that are you know we're teaching in a
range between and so this has been

457
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,440
really nice to allow a sort of defeat in
people where they make sense in terms of

458
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:23,609
their skill level of maturity yes really
awful and say I've been writing the code

459
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:27,089
that does it for not looking at it leave
does all of our stuff and he would know

460
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:29,900
that answer and I don't off the top of
my head so I want to lie to you I have

461
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,369
no idea no idea it's an instantaneous

462
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:47,810
that's a great point i'm glad you said
that cuz I completely drop that the way

463
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:52,339
that we're handling that for critic
counties but there's two dimensions to

464
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:57,140
it so it's your risk level 134 and then
there's the criticality of the finding

465
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,490
and we have sort of a matrix that says
that we need a remediation plan in place

466
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,200
in expert of time so if you're a
critical a political vulnerability

467
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,419
within 24 hours I know this one we have
to have a remediation plan in place now

468
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,200
the real key there is a plan in place
because I might not know as a tester I

469
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,589
know what's critical and I was like OMG
kind of issue but I have no idea what

470
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:21,070
it's going to take on the backside
actually fix that is this like a

471
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:25,290
two-line code changes like every sector
of the whole bloody thing I don't know

472
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,619
the real big thing for us is to just
have a remediation plan in place now

473
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:33,910
fixed to the work to places that must be
fixed the next days and that's like your

474
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,560
plan that out your backside in all
honesty like there's no idea you have no

475
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,420
clue in most cases what would really
take to fix that you just how bad it so

476
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,980
that gives you a nice sort of way to
interact with the dev teams and say look

477
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,300
this is really bad we need to get this
fixed let's talk about timelines and

478
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,680
then at least I can get a date they can
drop into account and go back and say

479
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,720
hey you're one week out from saying
you're having this critical fixed is it

480
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,730
really fixed how we do it right you can
kind of nudge people in the right

481
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,349
direction

482
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:08,910
yeah def Teenz well the remediation
players on both of us honestly really at

483
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,819
the end of the day I guess it didn't
happen in following are back so we're

484
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,450
pretty motivated like to tell these
people but with the benefits we've seen

485
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,379
over the course of this year we have
enough points with management that we

486
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,410
have had trouble getting people to come
to the table and a lot of it is because

487
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,598
we're not saying you must fix it in
seven days arbitrarily were saying look

488
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,609
problem let's figure out how long it's
gonna take I just need a date from you

489
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:30,848
right

490
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,340
yes

491
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:44,120
yeah we definitely do and those would
trump aris always what we what we wanted

492
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,779
to make a generic thing that fits all
and then obviously there's exceptions to

493
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,890
that

494
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,240
ya get it done

495
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:02,230
yeah yeah we will pull that card if we
have to but for us making a generic fits

496
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,730
everybody is solely that matrix worked
really well and then we just handle the

497
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:09,830
exceptions of the come up and Bo
actually I didn't mention this has a I

498
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,740
don't know how many atoms put a
ridiculous number of regulations in

499
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,180
there so you can actually take
applications with the regulatory

500
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,049
requirements so we can actually no other
is PCI on this thing therefore isolates

501
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:35,470
don't don't count yeah the PC is going
to supersede the normal yea oh so the

502
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:41,319
other reason we like absolute pipelines
is a five acts so our numbers these are

503
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:48,640
rough numbers 2014 we did 44 assessments
2015 we did two hundred assessments and

504
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,310
I have killed in front of it because
honestly we didn't start collecting

505
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,299
metrics to largely really launched the
pipeline so I'm guessing we had about

506
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:01,080
200 officially we have a hundred and
ninety somewhat I think actually in bed

507
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,870
holding or internet fix but we missed
three months of data so we haven't we

508
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,150
just now actually going back and
counting everything but we're gonna end

509
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:15,000
up right at 200 the other things to note
right is that we actually lost people in

510
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,920
2015 we lost three and a half people
roughly one guy got put have time on

511
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,690
something else so he will only get half
of this time one senior guy left in you

512
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,730
know found exciting opportunities
elsewhere we lost a couple other people

513
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,570
so we actually lost people added more so
if you do this math it's like four

514
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:43,980
points 5 4486 4487 I rounded up his five
sons really good yes I'm sorry the team

515
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,140
with holding is at the peak it was 12

516
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,850
absolutely was

517
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:53,400
people we we were very limited given
access to bank holding his really thats

518
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,860
are like what's going on in our shop and
although people have asked like and

519
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,690
would like to be overlooked and holding
on like what do you want to know from a

520
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:07,170
holding a REST API and reduce your
report just because it we can be the

521
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,030
comments can be honest and bigger
beholding to nothing else on this team

522
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,450
is a real work with can live in bed
holding off worried about somebody

523
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:23,230
saying if nothing else we've had crazy
good look let's talk about holding here

524
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:29,620
it is on get up and go down but it's a
jungle out there is a program in Homs

525
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,450
hold all of our applications all of
engagement tracking it does some

526
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:39,230
rudimentary reports it was all comments
on application or engagement or activity

527
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,860
so you can kind of leave breadcrumbs if
you have to do like a handoff to take

528
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,200
Joe off of inputs ally on a joke in the
comments of like have to the you know

529
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,430
the shopping cart but not the profile
page or whatever we have a data

530
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,980
classification plan and PII data so you
can actually list what PID you have and

531
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,570
what classification Pearson has a day to
Classification standard so we wired that

532
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,580
in there we actually talked about we
take all of it takes to do the various

533
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,259
activities really nice historical elder
pass assessments who's ever had like

534
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,050
management committee says when was the
last time you looked at Becks and you go

535
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:19,320
I remember that name sometime last year
maybe let me look right now it's just a

536
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,820
bag of holding we use it as a credential
repositories so when we're doing

537
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,650
engagements and we assign somebody to go
test you know that whatever the dev

538
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,390
instance of whatever Apple the credit
for that after in there so we can logon

539
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,250
one of our guys can login knows is that
automatically go get the credit just to

540
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,300
sort of smooth testing along and we have
a ton of environmental details and I'm

541
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,340
screenshot so here's an example team
dashboard with not too terribly many

542
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,540
people in it

543
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,950
nearly twice as must be tested obviously
we've dealt with this is here the

544
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,140
activities by User here's the opening
statements we don't have any empty

545
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,580
engagements and empty engagement is an
engagement with no activities were

546
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,980
people assigned

547
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,840
and then unassigned activities so we
gotta figure out who's going to do this

548
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,560
rubble after a mountain 50 minutes while
I gotta cook thank you I'm growing long

549
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,970
this is the horribly badly visible
screenshot of the application repository

550
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,990
the key feature is we have a ton of
metadata around them and you can search

551
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,240
by all of my life cycle platform
audience technologies all of its

552
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,100
filterable integ

553
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,700
crazy sorting of all of the applicants
repository which has been silly useful

554
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,750
for us as we have four hundred or so in
here now I don't remember exactly last

555
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,760
time I looked for some sort of basic
reporting on the status of an

556
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,900
application so here's metro setup thread
fix its using my sequel and PHP and

557
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:50,690
Apache all this kind of metadata of a
quick picture of the status of a nap I'm

558
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,420
here's another one defect todo that
started when I was at Rackspace and

559
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,050
continued and is now actually in the
public domain and this is another one

560
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:04,080
that's up on github is Apache License I
can remember it's very similar to bigger

561
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,779
holding it also does some reporting and
has some way to import manual testing

562
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,310
but it also give engagements and Celeste
metrics it's pretty cool

563
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,540
number two of the three ways wow I'm
gonna go fast

564
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,400
was improve feedback so open yourself to
upstream and downstream information this

565
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,020
is a tweet I made a while back I was
back in April cuz I was just sick and

566
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,740
tired of logging into the end web
console to get out trickin data that I

567
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,729
had to get with the freakin website and
not in an automated fashion so in my

568
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,760
rage I die tweeted this

569
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,050
lot of people but their vendors about
this if I could do with the UI I never

570
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,130
bloody monologue another thing I want to
you I i mean API so I can go write some

571
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:53,500
code to login like I've read my last
screen scraper I'm done in this is a

572
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,600
chaplain spoke earlier that we call will
be using stacks them to do the eventing

573
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,770
portion of it and then this will have
the name of the Python bob that does so

574
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,619
you can ask that sent but for help and
it'll tell you the various things that

575
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,330
can do including fun things like I want
advice on cross site scripting

576
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,030
and they'll say oh well this crisis
gripping here's a link to our actual

577
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,500
library where we actually have more
details on cross site scripting

578
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,490
international were on everywhere except
for Antarctica Pearson has offices on

579
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:29,799
every continent after Antarctica so
we're 24 7 365 and I don't want to be

580
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,730
that so if we're not around and have
something in that time zone the f-16

581
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,440
they can at the very least as hit check
for some baseline advice right that was

582
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,960
kind of a motivator for this you can
actually if you're in our private

583
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,140
channel you can actually get stats on
what an application has currently in 36

584
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,920
like what what is X have got no critical
snow high as a medium and three Lohse

585
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,550
right you can also create an application
with creates an application profile and

586
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,180
third victim victim holding you can
summary metrics for the entire upset

587
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,859
program like how are we doing how many
absolutely done all that kind of

588
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,150
meditative we can pull out mostly driven
by management Dr is saying hey are we

589
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:13,390
doing like chat window and ran a little
quick question about you can see us man

590
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:21,670
we have Duluth right easy the other
really cool thing is it's ok this one is

591
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,430
we did this for check marks where you
can actually estabas in our private

592
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:30,020
channel to set up a check marks for the
industry is for the application icon

593
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,290
master it's part of course which is a
business unit here is the link to its

594
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:39,270
repository I'll take that information
headed over to stack storm stuck storm

595
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,720
is a predefined workflow to actually
reach into check marks set up an

596
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,529
application in their application is an
investment holding a threat fix it

597
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,610
automatically adds them there and that
such a weekly as a default pool

598
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:56,720
whirlpool your source code of the repo
run a scan and generate results I wrote

599
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,149
some code that take those results and
government a threat fix so than a minute

600
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,810
we get automatic reoccurring weekly
static analysis talking about yes

601
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:18,960
right now and I'm just a word about that
to be bluntly honest with you it polls

602
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,839
the by the faulted polls master from get
their code base if they're working on a

603
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,259
branch or something we will see that but
right now this is much better than what

604
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,309
we had before so I'm happy and we'll
figure out a way to find that out in the

605
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:45,410
world with that there's a consistent
branching scheme for every project and

606
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,700
then the third part of the three ways of
demonstrators continued experimentation

607
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,598
learning and this is i think really
fundamentally that what saved us is the

608
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,359
fact that me and Adam went metaphor an
entire year and we just like what's the

609
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:59,740
problem we need to fix what's hurting
people where people losing lots of time

610
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:05,490
and let's go fix those failures only
serve to limit the scope of what must be

611
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,640
tried to succeed and we've had some
things that we tried that we're

612
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,558
absolutely awful and we can to the curb
we tried something else right that's

613
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:13,849
what you do it's like how do you know
what we're going to try and see what

614
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:14,339
happens

615
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,480
and lot of stuff didn't work the stuff
the work week and I love this quote

616
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,450
right if you're not the man who has
practiced in 2006 once I fear the man

617
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,169
who has practice one kicked and thousand
times and i really think because we had

618
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,579
the pipeline and we had the consistency
of the steps and how we did things that

619
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:34,750
really made us get quick as we continue
to do so I got a manual assessment this

620
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,180
is where I go this is what I do there's
no questions but there's no emails back

621
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:44,140
and forth all that junk yards away
myself and Aaron Weaver created a

622
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,598
project on Olas Calculus AB psych
pipeline this is where we're trying to

623
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,950
click people of similar minds and get
some business cases and how people have

624
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,808
done this because I know what worked at
Pearson worked really great person it

625
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:58,260
will not work for you work because
you're different but the concept will

626
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,839
work right the concepts of what you need
to do and how we need to do it

627
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,099
universal but the specifics are right
because you're dead you're the way your

628
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:08,970
shoppers will be completely different so
we're trying to gather a lot of

629
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,950
information here so that people who are
in the situation connection learn from

630
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:17,240
each other have a some nice knowledge
sharing for example we started working

631
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,118
on getting out of different tool
integrations where they fit inside the

632
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:20,859
timeline

633
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:25,058
how can you use them right what's I'm
need to worry about storing where can I

634
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:27,749
store stuff I need to worry about
deploying your some tools that I can use

635
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:33,569
them to deploy timeframe we're taking
some of that and I have 10 minutes let's

636
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:39,499
see if I can do this really quick so
here is a site running on my localhost

637
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,640
this is an on the internet yet hopefully
will be on the internet next week but

638
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,808
this is an absolute copeland toolbox and
this is where my kind of gathered that

639
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:52,480
metadata about various and sundry tools
and post them online so that you can

640
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,380
point her for example this is extremely
rough like here as de facto Joe and

641
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,230
here's some information about it what's
useful in this is actually coming what's

642
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:10,239
what's cool about this is this is
actually coming straight out of this

643
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:24,119
marked down in this get hub so now I
feel but the idea is that I will have

644
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,079
all of the tools in get up and if you or
a vendor or practitioner and you want to

645
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,869
update or add information that at all
this just a PR request on get we'll take

646
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,249
it in will add it in every hour by
default the server using cold catapults

647
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:41,598
get home and pulls the latest into a
directory and so boom done like you do a

648
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,759
PR we accept UPR you're on the internet
done I should have this up hopefully

649
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:51,099
next week and closed up you'll see the
last night and they get up stuff works

650
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:55,529
though to change I just need to make
this page look pretty and not what I

651
00:49:55,529 --> 00:50:04,249
want to make sure people marked down and
market up and it works to take aways

652
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:08,430
like looked for paper cuts and automate
them like you need to have somebody go

653
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,940
at least partially because you will get
a huge increase in workload will

654
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,859
actually start see benefits like I said
we're I think the golden children at

655
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:20,460
Pearson right now because we have been
silly productive and find it figured

656
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,999
whatever your workflow is normalize it
and make it kind of easy button as much

657
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:24,950
as you can

658
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,118
that was a huge boon for us and whatever
system you create make sure that grows

659
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,090
organically and if you can like learn to
talk to

660
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,520
and speak their language because those
are the people that are going to fixing

661
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,200
the things we find right so like being
rude and agree to them is probably not

662
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,660
the best way to motivate them to find
them sometimes you do have to use a

663
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,600
stick but I prefer to like start with
care and thanks and I will answer any

664
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,250
questions you have these are waiting at
home
