1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:27,778
my fellow colleagues modelers they're
all there's only four of us who've

2
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,238
written books about this and you know
you can decide which ones you think are

3
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,019
are decent but it's not a huge body of
literature I think maybe six people have

4
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:51,799
actually read my book and you know I'm
sorry we can do that after ok I'm gonna

5
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:54,930
get started with some of the stuff but
will give you know will let people

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:03,739
filter in as as they want let's get
started so this is a little bit about me

7
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:09,789
why you should listen to me or not and
I'm not gonna read all this stuff but

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,409
I've been around for a while for about
30 years making trouble and my feeling

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,470
about this is blah blah blah show me the
money let's see you can decide after

10
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,080
this presentation whether whether some
of these things you know where they're

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,830
not a couple of things I have to tell
you in order to speak and follow my own

12
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:37,509
policies that I work for Intel otherwise
they shoot me and but this is materials

13
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,430
and other properties in Delhi started
long before I work work for them and

14
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,280
it's my material but feel free to use it
really

15
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,110
the idea here is to help people get
better at this thing we need to do

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,990
called threat modeling or secure design
of which threat modeling is a piece and

17
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,130
I'll explain that a bit so this little
mnemonic that I use or pedagogy is not a

18
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:14,450
hard piece of theoretical or otherwise
it's not really a method to go talk to

19
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:25,319
his name I just saw Tony UV he has a
real method and I do not I have a

20
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,859
pedagogy because I've taught this to
hundreds of people literally by now

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:38,480
absolutely hundreds and so it's just
another manic or a pedagogy ok so here's

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,030
some expectations from this session if
you're entirely new threat modeling at

23
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,470
least you'll understand what it is and
you can get started

24
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,740
that's the point for learners were gonna
dig deeper and maybe get some more

25
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,280
skills for your experts maybe you'll get
some tricks and get out and teach threat

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,380
modeling we really need people to not
just do it but teach it is we are need

27
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,820
people who were involved in software
security need to be working on design

28
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,109
and I'm going to make some points but
that so let's start with the

29
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,830
participatory part of this just shout
out or raise your hand and all columns

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,790
what do you get out of this set of boxes
and arrows anything at all in fact let

31
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,400
me ask you this has have any of you ever
gone into Architecture Review and seen

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,060
an architecture that looked like that
few people right and what did you do

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,510
with it I mean literally there's not
much there right

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,200
pretty scary about this one

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
do we know a little more

36
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,260
well we know there's some kind of thing
someone thinks is a firewall we know

37
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,439
there's a back in and something that we
think of as a user

38
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,859
at least that's something we don't have
some data flow right because the thing

39
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:09,939
about threat modeling is that it's about
it's about understanding and

40
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:15,739
understanding in a certain way and so
this doesn't this this is actually a

41
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,949
real architecture somebody actually gave
to me which you know I couldn't do

42
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,449
anything with so let me set the problem
the central problem we're working on

43
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,729
here we have a design problem in
software security we have to build

44
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:35,500
appropriate security how do we get there
let me make some point here everybody

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:44,120
know about the GPAC anybody not know do
but the GPAC ok well my friend Chris

46
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,650
valla second someone else got onto the
entertainment system and then started

47
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,130
working with the brakes in the ignition
on the car while it was going down the

48
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:59,130
road so so is that a coding problem I'm
willing to bet that that Jeep Wrangler

49
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:06,580
met them israel coding standards and got
all of the other stuff that it passed

50
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,669
all of its stuff that it needed to why
did this get out there because they did

51
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,349
not talk about secure designed this is a
design problem you don't put and

52
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:23,740
entertainment system open to the world
on a life-or-death bus that's a design

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,780
problem not a coding problem we clear
about that

54
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,520
here's another one you don't get a
universal password that's going to go

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,250
out everywhere in the field and
thousands and thousands of things that

56
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,800
are designed problems no coding problem
and then we'll go to this one different

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,349
kind of design problem and that's why I
want to put this up here this is a

58
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:50,349
different kind of design problem
everyone knows what the target hack

59
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,919
right right they lost forty percent of
their business from this so highly

60
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,359
impactful and this is a situation where

61
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:07,060
r one vendor had access to the entire
network that's a system-level design

62
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,010
problem it's not a coding problem that
we made any coding mistakes they have to

63
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,940
mean maybe there was something in the
HVAC vendor that got them in I don't

64
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,719
know about that but the fact that they
had all this access is the design

65
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,650
problem in fact whose company uses the
same bpm profile for for everything for

66
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,250
everyone when they get in

67
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,050
vendors whoever no no hold up your hands
will break your NDA's but just think

68
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,850
about that right

69
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,690
don't hold up your hands we don't want
to see those hands thanks because she

70
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,600
will break you violate your NDA's with
that alright here's a start tellin I

71
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,990
worked on this Christophe is here who
worked on this thirteen architects two

72
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,090
and a half months a small book I don't
think I Tripoli is everything you like

73
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,580
but nevertheless it's a start

74
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,340
if you're if you're wondering what we're
talking about in terms of secure

75
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,460
designed this is a start it's Creative
Commons so I stick the same here because

76
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,950
I encourage you to download it and read
it we have a design problem now I wanna

77
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,620
I wanna switch gears here a little bit
and say that the point is you gotta get

78
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,250
the right requirements

79
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,460
how do you get those how do you get the
requirements in so that its people are

80
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,900
designing and architecting software to
come up with the right security stuff

81
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,590
the authentication system the way to
handle the credential as in the Juniper

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,580
problem or in the sense of thinking
about about VPN profiles for instance to

83
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,260
get the right structure of different
kinds of access how do you do that well

84
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,510
one thing you gotta remember as we go
through this is just a little tip the

85
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,210
early requirements get the worm so to
speak because there's a mindshare thing

86
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,370
that happens over time when the security
person comes in and does the analysis

87
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,900
after the thing is darn near built what
happens everybody has mind

88
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,948
air and it seems like an interjection it
seems like an insult sometimes so when

89
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,530
you can get in there early so there's a
timing part of this but we're not going

90
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,400
to delve into I do delve into a little
bit in core software security which is

91
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,620
the book previous to my last one but
we're we're not gonna we're not going to

92
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,729
develop delve into this much but I
wanted to make the point so you're on

93
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,060
top of this earlier is better but too
early you can only do so much so there's

94
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,968
a nicely balanced there that's an
experience thing and just you know talk

95
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,130
to me later write me give you a bunch of
links to contact me with we're not going

96
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,760
to go into this much I just want to
mention it now let's take a look at this

97
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,350
slide here is this this bear some
thinking architecture the reason we use

98
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,140
architecture and call it architecture to
tool for managing complexity complex

99
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,680
systems and we you know a couple of
architectures where you see a lot more

100
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,569
complex systems are too much when it's
too much to hold in your head you know

101
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,990
beyond help hello world then you start
playing with a larger blocks that say

102
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,089
okay I'll group all this stuff together
and I'll group all that stuff together

103
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,350
and then I can sort of look at it and
understand the structure of the thing

104
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:36,130
okay so it's our tool that's important
threat modeling is the tool for secure

105
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,850
design it needs an architecture it needs
to understand structure and as we will

106
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,720
see you look at things in different ways
so you know architecture is our our

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,790
thing for understanding complexity and
also for playing with change what if we

108
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,449
do something this way we can take the
blocks and move around you can move the

109
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,330
arrows around and say ok what does that
mean how does that work and so it's both

110
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,430
a tool for managing complexity for
understanding it and a tool for playing

111
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,550
with change potential change threat
modeling requires architecture you have

112
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,969
to understand the structure of a thing
while at the same time understanding it

113
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,970
from the point of the attacker

114
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,459
ok let's move on modeling I like to say
is applied security architecture so few

115
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,619
security architect where the rubber
meets the road where you apply all the

116
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,730
stuff you know is when you threat model
ok good with that any questions about

117
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,279
that just yet are you with me

118
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:50,950
ok so let's go on I put this in every
one of my slide decks because when I say

119
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,100
secure software everybody thinks of
something else

120
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,010
one person thinks so the pen testing get
the vulnerabilities out the

121
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:06,980
authentication system I'm using HTTPS on
a secure how many times have I heard

122
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,730
that

123
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,720
HTTPS is the architects peanut butter
for security I mean I'm seeing a lot of

124
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,240
people are laughing and if the other
folks don't get the joke the inside joke

125
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,390
here is if you've been to a lot of
architecture reviews

126
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,110
time and time again the brilliant and
fabulous Solution Architect when you

127
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,140
come in and say one look at the security
will look at you and say we're using

128
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,890
HTTPS as though that's the final answer
to all things so I put this up here

129
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,890
because I want I want I want to
establish what I mean by secure software

130
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:46,850
and interestingly all of these are
designed problems only one bullet point

131
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,579
up here has anything to do with
vulnerabilities I'm not suggesting the

132
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,109
vulnerabilities are important and I
don't really care what the number

133
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,660
distribution is because the attackers
only looking for their leverage they got

134
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,620
one good design flaw they can manipulate
you don't care how many vulnerabilities

135
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:10,610
are there or not you know weird bugs
coding implementation problems and if

136
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,320
they can find one good coding
implementation of problem they don't

137
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,329
care for design is rock solid it's not
that's not the way for attackers think

138
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,250
ok so let's get started here

139
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,709
get rolling here is an architecture I'm
not gonna tell you anything about this

140
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,930
architecture for a moment

141
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,680
folks

142
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,689
feel free to shout out except for Dell
and maybe christophe casinos he knows

143
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:48,130
but feel free to shot out and say yeah
and also robert is a brilliant threat

144
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:55,779
modeler you guys the word what do you
see hear anybody what is this

145
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:09,790
shut up Yeah Yeah Yeah right everybody
see that usery on internet yet web

146
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,050
servers you got application server and
data bases this is actually called the

147
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,719
three tier architecture

148
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,620
pretty standard but what don't we know
which is kind of interesting when we

149
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:32,890
look at that we don't know the context
and the purpose we can infer from this

150
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:39,730
certain things because I will tell you
one thing that is 100% certain in the

151
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,760
security world there is one thing that I
can say with absolute certainty if you

152
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,939
stick a web server up on the Internet it
will get whacked maybe not successfully

153
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,810
but it will get whacked and it will be
between seventeen seconds

154
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,609
approximately eight hours depending upon
where this week's are hundred percent

155
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,730
certainty it'll get it'll get attacked
not necessarily successfully if you've

156
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,660
done your job right but it will get
whacked so that's the one thing we know

157
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,810
we know that that front end is going to
receive a lot of nasty traffic

158
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,579
irrespective of authentication
authorization any of those other things

159
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,420
we know that that front Nick right there

160
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:32,839
this one right here is gonna get 100%
alright so knowing that that gives us

161
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:39,690
some information but we don't have the
rest of this context now I made up this

162
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,940
lunar mining because i'm dumb and I can
never remember anything and so I need

163
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,060
something to help me climb into it and
say what do I have to ask about stuff

164
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,119
and these are the things you have to ask
is all in the book by the way these are

165
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:03,120
things you have to ask in order to have
enough information to do a threat model

166
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,010
well and so you've got another threat
landscape that's peace will spend a

167
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:16,189
little time at but if you go and talk to
Tony UV and Marco Moreno they actually

168
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,959
know a lot more about this they are
really really good at this stuff but you

169
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,779
gotta know your threat landscape what's
relevant what's not relevant as we said

170
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,400
the reason I put a web thing up there is
because there's a hundred percent

171
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,920
certainty it'll get attacked by somebody
and lots of somebody's ok you have to

172
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:40,120
understand what risk posture your
organization requires and I give you an

173
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:50,910
example if you only see your customer
once and you are always just seeing a

174
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:56,449
customer once and you don't care about
whether they like you or not do you care

175
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:01,329
about cross-site scripting because costs
like scripting is an attacker using

176
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:05,140
misusing your website to attack your
customer so anybody who cares about the

177
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,579
customers nothing like it but if you
don't care you but your customer I would

178
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,630
argue morally you two should care about
it that's different point but as a

179
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,750
business thing you really care about
that cross site scripting will it really

180
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,020
harm your business model answer is no
cause you only see your customer wants

181
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,740
you don't care they get whacked or not
so that might be off your radar your

182
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,940
risk posture that that your customers
get whacked by your website you might

183
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,089
not care I would argue morally that's
wrong but from from from a pure business

184
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,089
standpoint I'm sure there are businesses
that run themselves that way and so what

185
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,140
i'm all i'm suggesting as you got
another risk posture gotta understand

186
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,110
how much risk tolerance and what's
important what's not a speaker this

187
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,980
afternoon

188
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,630
Tony UV made some really strong points
about this so I'm not going to go into

189
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,420
that but it's a whole long how you find
that ours is not that easy

190
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,589
you also have to know what's already in
place what can you use and what are the

191
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,409
limitations that you have to put into
your threat model so if you already have

192
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,409
an authentication system you know like
in a web environment

193
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,040
why would you build another one you need
to know how that works and you need to

194
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,658
know how you hook it but you also need
to know if it has some weaknesses you

195
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:24,120
might need to make up for in your code
so you want to know what the structures

196
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,399
are and then you gotta know this stuff
the data sensitivity that you're playing

197
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,970
with and I would argue that whenever you
ask that question data sensitivity you

198
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,690
always want to say what is the highest
sensitivity here is if you just add you

199
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,780
know people answer things like well most
of its public what about that other

200
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,918
little bit that's top secret ok but you
have to kind of build for the stuff

201
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,350
that's you know most difficult you gotta
know about execution environments

202
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,570
because she executes really differently
than Java and it has different problems

203
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:04,928
and you have to know how things are
deployed ok with me there is no book of

204
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,010
correct answers to any of these
questions each organization is different

205
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:16,179
you have to do your organization
investigate your worse ok now we're

206
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:22,280
going to play with some architectures
one thing as I as I looked at the way I

207
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,690
work in the way that real practitioners
work and the way things really evolved

208
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,740
in real situations is that I end up with
a lot of different views because it's

209
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,990
too much information to get one view
under one viewer not have seen a couple

210
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,320
of interesting ways to do that but
basically you come in and you get

211
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,970
something like those three boxes and
then you make them draw more right so

212
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:56,700
here's here's here's here's an
architecture cold call you a little

213
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:03,900
unfair but cold call what can we infer
from this if anything from a threat

214
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,240
model from attackers perspective we know
at all what's being protected

215
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,419
sure

216
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:29,509
good point but how we get at it do we
know what it does it mean for anything

217
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:39,869
about what it does go Christopher this
guy this actually some architecture I

218
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:44,549
had it redrawn for the book because they
don't wanna get sued actually taken from

219
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,139
an actual real market xterm architecture
is in marketing architecture it told me

220
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:52,439
nothing I couldn't threat model it and
that's why I stuck it in the book I had

221
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,100
it redrawn though because they don't get
sued for anybody to know that I was

222
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,418
actually using a real architecture we
changed the name to protect the maybe

223
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,999
not so innocent but it actually Chris
office right it actually came from a

224
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,830
business intelligence thing and these
are sources and whatnot

225
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,960
we're going to actually threat model
real business intelligence not real one

226
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:18,860
perfect ational but one more information
than this I hope but nice but it's still

227
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:24,279
it's not enough it's not the right stuff
you got it the right stuff that's my

228
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:29,360
whole point here so let's come back to
website Karama let me tell you about

229
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,189
this let me give you some of the 3 S's
here

230
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:40,240
website aroma is an apolitical stock
fictitious this all fictitious based on

231
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:49,399
real stuff but fictitious web web
cyclorama is a supposedly a sock online

232
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:59,850
stock retailer and fictitious thousands
of socks catalogues of socks every stock

233
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:09,158
you can imagine bicycle socks knee socks
toe socks yeah this is their business

234
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,249
and they're fairly successful and giving
you those sort of business stuff they

235
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:16,889
want to protect their customers they
feel like their customers whether they

236
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:21,100
bought anything or not any visitor their
site is precious because someday they

237
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,860
might buy songs they are apolitical
though the reason I tell you that they

238
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,350
try to avoid controversy is not all
retailers

239
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:36,520
do because that's their business model
so their risk averse to adverse like

240
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,780
activism or or adverse publicity with me
I'm just setting the stage here this is

241
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,260
the stuff you gotta know they're fairly
risk-averse about taking they want to

242
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:56,020
protect their customers data and their
and their catalog anybody coming change

243
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,440
the catalog they sell the stocks they
sell anybody come and stick pornography

244
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,090
in there anything else

245
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,918
ok and they they try to avoid anything
but socks that's all they're interested

246
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,270
in selling socks and doing a good job
the way this architecture works as a web

247
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,490
server up in front

248
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:20,309
this is an application server that also
builds applications anybody ever hear

249
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,428
those things they were popular about ten
years ago there were things that would

250
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,980
build applications no coding involved
you just go in big bunch of stuff but

251
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,950
phrases together and it builds on the
application that's what this is but you

252
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,720
can also add your own Java applications
Java web server with some other stuff on

253
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,460
top of it that's also job it's running
in a Java web server container

254
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,789
pretty standard and this is data base
server which has a whole bunch of data

255
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:51,919
bases it serves ok with me

256
00:22:51,919 --> 00:23:00,940
ok so let's play a little here where do
you see what's the stuff that's worthy

257
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,970
of protecting here where do you see that

258
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:17,500
good anybody else can we protect the
user's browser how do we do that yeah

259
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,350
yeah we want we want to make sure that
they don't people don't get attacked

260
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:26,719
right very good others yeah very
sensitive to that

261
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,039
yeah very sensitive to that these
configuration things here but if

262
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:42,000
somebody can change the way an app works
that's very true

263
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,620
yes very true how about somebody
inserting a nap into this into this web

264
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,469
server into this app server think they
did not like that very much having their

265
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,690
own app in there too who knows what
siphon off financial stuff and whatever

266
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,299
it is a bunch of we've got a bunch of
targets here where are the ways the

267
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:11,110
attacker can get into this let's imagine
that a minute how does the attacker get

268
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,320
to these targets and why might they go
after these targets

269
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,679
the whole back in for every one of these
systems isn't there in order to

270
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,190
administer it when you get on the
employee net which is let's say for a

271
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:56,390
moment it's a little bit open and you
you are you fish in employee go go

272
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,559
this kind of system could point or other
things about this kind of system is that

273
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,360
the messages walk right through whatever
firewall and you have it has to work

274
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,240
that way and so you've got you know
you've got a perfect package for sending

275
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,910
attacks and they can flow all the way if
you're not careful to the database

276
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,710
server or even into the database and sit
there and black people picking up

277
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,400
product so there's a whole flow that
happens here where you can you can get

278
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,420
some stuff here you might get some stuff
here you might have to do some work here

279
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,950
and so on through the chain because in
order to process the message you have to

280
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,380
take it backwards through the through
the layers I think that's what you were

281
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:12,710
meaning good point ok let's move on how
do we do this I like to start at the

282
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,200
organization's purpose of first time I
get to an organization I sit around and

283
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,390
I talked to a lot of people

284
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:26,559
luckily I'm now a senior enough that the
top people will actually hear me now

285
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,670
hosting always the case and took years
originally you know when I started down

286
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,820
this game who is this

287
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,610
Schofield guy I met at a time to answer
his email important but you know over

288
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,770
the years it's gotten a lot easier but
you need access you need to talk to

289
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,200
decision makers in leaders to get the
organization now if you work at a place

290
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,620
a long time you already know this stuff
you know you you've seen the vision than

291
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,760
whatever but you also have to know what
is the system's purpose what goals as

292
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:06,500
its serb for the organization what part
is it going to play and then you start

293
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,990
looking at the architecture I like to
look at things that are functional think

294
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:17,610
I've got a good wow these slides
together is that actually works this is

295
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,820
a fictional again all the architecture's
in my book and these are all drawn from

296
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:28,629
a book are fictional to any any
similarity to living or dead system

297
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,940
is purely coincidental I don't wanna get
sued so I took all the real

298
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,960
architectures and turn them into
something else

299
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,870
changed the names because i dont wanna
get sued by anybody but it's actually

300
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,780
you know pretty close to a to an
enterprise conceptual architecture that

301
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,500
I actually one side so you can also
count on these things are based on

302
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,130
reality so this is the way the
Enterprise Architect me look at a

303
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,880
enterprise cause what they're interested
in is really different than what you're

304
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,850
interested in as a threat model or so
here's the little problem is the people

305
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,610
you work with who you need to explain
what's going on are not going to be

306
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,889
looking at security the way you are
there could be looking at their thing

307
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,590
their views are going to be really
vastly different notice how things are

308
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:22,230
really clamped in very business anyways
here very business away supply chain

309
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:27,000
e-commerce the only thing they broken
out his presentation layers and then

310
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,280
there's this troublesome little box at
the bottom

311
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:38,260
anybody ever seen the security box in
architecture you know for years this bug

312
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,370
me and I was I wouldn't really kind of
make fun behind people's backs and then

313
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,040
I checked myself and really slammed
myself and said wait a minute if I were

314
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,149
an enterprise architect I need to box up
this very messy and and cross-functional

315
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,360
thing called security and put it in a
box and put it to the side because I

316
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,540
can't deal with it and that's why they
do that it's so inaccurate it's

317
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,750
laughable right however if you're the
enterprise architecting you're actually

318
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,950
trying to work out how all of these
things are going to get integrated this

319
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,170
is a problematic so you stick it in a
little box and put it the side so you

320
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,430
can manage the complexity that's why
it's there but obviously we can deal

321
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,170
with it that way to this is a break out
of that same architecture in a

322
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,270
functional manner when I can spend a lot
of time on it because I want to move

323
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,240
along one thing I want to point out
because we're gonna get into a new

324
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,780
middle is the message bus goes across
the security layer the trust boundary

325
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,840
see that in other words this is the
thing that

326
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,709
breaches are security model just
remember that will need that in a minute

327
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,240
but you see it starts getting really
busy when you break it out functionally

328
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,880
and you break it down into some zones
maybe it's not too busy just yet we're

329
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,650
going to just take one system out of
this and and threat modeling so don't

330
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,940
worry if you can't get to everything on
that screen just gonna take in how busy

331
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,510
it is and how I have broken out the same
stuff now we have these e-commerce

332
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,210
section is one whole section and it
starts to make sense from a functional

333
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:26,570
perspective and the supply chain is
separated out as a separate set of

334
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,029
systems which is very typical scalding
extranet now if I stick overflows in

335
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:41,740
their look what happens is pretty much
impossible it's a nice charge and this

336
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,809
is why you want to start breaking stuff
down when you get to their new trying to

337
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:52,340
get every bit of information on this
thing no break it down because you won't

338
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,049
be able to you you won't be able to
understand it

339
00:30:55,049 --> 00:31:00,340
ok I used this mnemonic at Haslam the
reason I stuck architecture first is

340
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,459
because it sounds better than tad really
was there any anywhere you go in this in

341
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,590
fact a really great threat Marler once
said to me very recently wherever you

342
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:17,959
start here you have to do all these
things and it's a circle and so you

343
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,799
start anywhere that's convenient that
you like and then you move through all

344
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,889
of these things I like to start
architecture cuz I like to know what I'm

345
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,340
talking about but you could start
elsewhere you could list all the

346
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,080
relevant threats you know are all the
defense's you just have to do all of

347
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:42,480
these ok unfortunately these hide a
whole lot of steps will we're gonna do

348
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,120
these so so don't worry if you don't
take it in but you know I think they'll

349
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,280
post that the deck and what not to do it
don't worry if you if you can't take it

350
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,649
in and this is just one high-level
outlying these things break down

351
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:04,400
and even more stuff I point out it is
and highly recursive process and it

352
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,670
tends to be fractal as John Stevens says
and so you really the way this tries to

353
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,740
show you as you really you can get
anywhere in here and discover a whole

354
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,560
new bunch of stuff that you have to dig
into and have to go back to the top and

355
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:25,360
start again so its nonlinear a lot of
the time so those of you have really the

356
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,090
definite engineering mining you gotta go
step by step by step by step where to go

357
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,199
when you threat modeling it's much
better could threaten others sort of

358
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,900
know where they are and can pop back to
a different place yes please

359
00:32:46,770 --> 00:33:00,879
yes that's very true and that was
actually a good piece of the target hack

360
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,220
I would I would argue good point and and
a lot of times you do deal that a lot of

361
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,760
times defenses are sometimes process and
not technology to so process definitely

362
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,340
comes into it so let's think about
threats when I teach this at Intel

363
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,169
security I actually spend a half an hour
total half an hour listing all the

364
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,820
threats always the same threat we know
who the threats are at a gross level but

365
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,399
I make people kind of go through it and
get their brains wrapped around it cuz

366
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,460
it somehow helps to unlock the whole
process a bit I don't have time to do

367
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:44,810
that today with you but this would be
kind of a matrix III actually based on

368
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:52,340
some work by Jack Jones who wrote fair
and I'm a big fan of fair but i just

369
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,990
want to show you that you can actually
understand the threats and how to defend

370
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:03,710
them by categorizing them if you pick
out the attributes of a certain length

371
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,230
is a big class you can you can poke
holes and there's this is a stereotype

372
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,330
any single cybercriminal might be more
or less clever than this but as a

373
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,668
general rule they're very risky third
aversive they usually don't have much

374
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,379
exposure to the you know only through
the web interface and that's how they

375
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:27,419
try to get in you know there they have
limited unless they're you know social

376
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,168
engineering your your employees or
whatever they don't have inside access

377
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:42,129
and they're very risk and then they tend
to use very medium to low sophistication

378
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,190
attacks and really it's about if your
house is is more secure than the one

379
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,190
next door that's the one that keeps
getting hit

380
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:23,069
absolutely in place if the system that
you're looking at is using that stuff if

381
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:26,869
it's a complete exception then all bets
are off that's one of those things in

382
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:31,950
that first that slideshow 23 @ sense
that you have to assess but that's basic

383
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,000
before you start threat modeling yes
it's understood absolutely ok so this is

384
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,710
a summarization of that of a couple of
different threat agents it's in the book

385
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,710
it's you know I just want to point out
that different kinds of threat agents

386
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,819
may or may not be relevant in the way
the attack is different their

387
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:53,829
sophistication is different and that
kinda helps if you only have to like we

388
00:35:53,829 --> 00:36:03,349
take website Karama their only worried
about cyber criminals really you know

389
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:08,910
there's not much intellectual property
in the world of socks is why I used that

390
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,200
as an example

391
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,210
until they are worried about about you
know some third you know nation states

392
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:21,140
dealing with stocks our catalog so its
public anyway they just don't want it

393
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:27,140
changed very different ok so there's not
much intellectual property in a in a

394
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,480
standard web system they just want to
sell stocks online oK so that's very

395
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,859
different than someone who maybe makes
routers and has crypto routines in those

396
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:42,390
routers very different looking example
like that in a minute so what you want

397
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,740
to know is who who are are your
attackers and what are their goals what

398
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:53,410
are their ultimate goals and then it's
good then you break it down to say okay

399
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,470
well how do they get to those cold
weather system objectives I'm not going

400
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,680
to go into this stuff will deeply but
this is the kind of chart you might make

401
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,569
for yourself and you only need to do
this kind of once each you don't really

402
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:12,160
need to do it like for every system if
you have a fairly well known set of

403
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,500
threats and and and attack types but
it's good to do that ok let's talk about

404
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,099
risk a little bit anybody ever seen this
equation here

405
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,089
risk

406
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:28,759
equals probability times annualized loss
it's in every InfoSec 101 course right

407
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:36,989
we can calculated we don't have an
actuarial tables so what's a poor

408
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:43,549
security architect to do well I'll
propose the first you have to know

409
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:49,569
something about your own risk tolerance
because it's not your risk tolerance

410
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:55,880
that's important it's your organizations
as a professional ok you gotta know what

411
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:02,519
risk posture is required so get yourself
factored out and then I'm gonna propose

412
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:08,118
this this is based on fair but I have
simplified it tremendously jack jones

413
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,489
did read that chapter he did make lots
of comments I did change the chapter in

414
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:19,160
favor of his comments however he did say
it was acceptable so I feel I'm pretty

415
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,649
good solid ground here as a practitioner
that I've got some reels rounding here

416
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:30,779
all you need to do is treat each one of
these as a binary for our purposes you

417
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,440
can calculate the stuff but you don't
have to

418
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,079
practitioner just need to treat those as
a by as a boolean if you can interrupt

419
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:48,539
any one of those you've interrupted what
I call a credible attack vector ok so

420
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:55,249
here's some very light logical stuff
here you can interrupt exposure which is

421
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,839
the usual way to do this then you've
killed

422
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:06,819
credible attack vector and thus you've
lowered the possibility of exploitation

423
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:13,950
is a very in you can do this very fast
you can do hundreds of these in a few

424
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:20,868
minutes in your mind you know this stuff
and so we can say that credible attack

425
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:28,099
vector is risk rating is something times
impact and so remember there's no risk

426
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:32,960
none if there's no impact on give an
example

427
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,360
how much impact is therefore a buffer
overflow on a Windows machine that can

428
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,360
only be exercised at debug level
privileges actually argued with a

429
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:57,260
security guy by this very good one how
much risk is their impact 0 because if

430
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,760
you already have debugged privileges
you're having your way with the machine

431
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,940
high-techs exciting buffer overflows
you're doing what you came to do

432
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,860
whatever that is as an attacker you're
not sitting around doing buffer

433
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,250
overflows that's what researchers to
anybody's researcher I don't mean to

434
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,990
insult you but that's what researchers
do but that's not what it

435
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:19,810
attackers do they're already using the
machine for botnet or looking at your

436
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,940
keystrokes or whatever they want to do
so you have to have impact you don't

437
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,260
care about vulnerabilities that don't
that's a way of doing this really fast

438
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:36,530
gotta be fast because that's the game
sometimes threat model will see 45

439
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,510
systems of the day

440
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:47,230
yeah well you can you can set this up
now that gets into just good enough risk

441
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,670
rating can I talk to you about that
afterwards because what we did is we

442
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:56,860
took all these things and then we gave
them numbers based on situations between

443
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:04,920
0 and one and then you can treat them
that way that's what I said and that's

444
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,940
for the quick mental but if you wanted
to play with this in turn it into a

445
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,210
rating system then you take those and
give them a number between 0 and one and

446
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,740
then you multiply it against some kind
of rating of impact and boom you've got

447
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,839
a number between you know you've got a
number that you can repeat yeah yeah

448
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:33,040
it might be greater than 0 yes less than
zero and greater than one yes absolutely

449
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:43,910
perfect number you ok so let's have some
fun this is in fact I'll let me tell you

450
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,470
a little bit about this so you have the
right context this is in fact supposed

451
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,180
to be a business intelligence system
fictitious again

452
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:59,140
name changed to protect the innocent or
guilty or something it's a business

453
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,190
intelligence system and i wanna play
with it with you all if you will

454
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,320
it's behind its on the corporate network
in behind the public firewalls and the

455
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,890
public sections so all on the local
network except if you recall from that

456
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:21,950
that other thing embrace it pay
attention this one bus goes into the

457
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:26,759
public sector and carries messages
somewhere not to the business

458
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,710
intelligence but to the data that's an
important piece here you have to know

459
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:37,490
this is a router manufacturer something
like a famous couple of famous router

460
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,500
manufacturers that Sumlin name shown
field might have worked for some at one

461
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:50,320
point or another and they are very
risk-averse their sales model is youself

462
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:57,290
highest-quality routers in the world the
most dependable so that you can raise

463
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,740
your prices that does sound like some
real-world company doesn't it

464
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:09,950
and that you know entirely fictitious
name is digital discus I made that up

465
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,890
and they sell routers and this is their
business intelligence system together

466
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:20,549
stuff about their business it's all in
the internal network but these data set

467
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:28,050
due to get data from from external
applications do you know enough it's

468
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:33,790
it's monitored their security monitoring
there's an identity services here so

469
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,210
this is the thing it pretty much touches

470
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:45,500
every datastore behind the firewall in
order to put stuff together with me now

471
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:52,060
let's look at the actual system anybody
want to try playing threat modeling with

472
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,210
this one to look for attack surface
let's just find the tax services and

473
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:01,190
digital discus has been the subject of
nation state attacks they have been the

474
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,360
subject of hacktivists attacks of the
try to avoid all controversy they still

475
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:11,980
have been labeled a big global
corporation enemy by some activists and

476
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:19,420
they have they have of course many
competitors in many countries and who

477
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,310
would love to get their intellectual
property so that's the threat landscape

478
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,400
and the ever-present cybercriminals
stuff going on

479
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:36,520
always so now where do you think the
attack services here are what do you

480
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:36,960
think

481
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,380
do you need me to explain this I guess I
can do this is system and it touches all

482
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,940
these guys all this data and it pulls
all this data in this article relating

483
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:52,730
attack surfaces you see any just
immediately by where the wily attacker

484
00:44:52,730 --> 00:45:00,700
how do I get into the system thank you
I'm sorry yes take the bus that's good

485
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:07,200
and get into the data stores so what
you're saying is any attack has to get

486
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:14,629
in here from the data yes true you see
these two things are obvious attack

487
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:25,260
points as john said anybody else let's
go on the system as it stands that's

488
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,260
probably small enough

489
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:36,370
so now let's try to find it so how would
you defend against that you got data

490
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,080
what are you gonna do you don't
necessarily trust that you have to suck

491
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,590
in and parse what are you gonna do
protect that with walk through the whole

492
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,590
thing with only five minute

493
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:07,600
from the expert right there yeah input
validation is critical and this is a

494
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,910
very hard input validation to do the
data gathering peace has to do

495
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:18,770
tremendous input validation and this is
actually a very difficult problem why

496
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:23,840
because it has to be a general take dad
in many many different forms so as to

497
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,840
understand one of the hardest parts and
problems we have is the general file

498
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,690
parser because you have to be general
enough to take anything but you have to

499
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,690
know all these different formats and
know whether it's legal go

500
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:15,009
and general general even more difficult
very difficult problem however that is

501
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:22,680
the answer there you can trust the data
rate answer so this is I'm gonna talk a

502
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,848
little bit about why I used these red
things which I've done like tons of

503
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:34,140
times in my life teaching this is I have
a lot of trouble with long lists long

504
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:40,868
lists which a lot of modeling methods
they may work for you I know robert and

505
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:43,839
I were talking about this earlier it may
work for you to see a long list of

506
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,000
assets are a long list of attack
surfaces in words before me about the

507
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,619
second or third attack service I begin
to glaze over and forget what I'm

508
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:58,039
thinking about and how it matches to a
structure so I like visual that's just a

509
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:03,240
personal stylist thing I don't want to
suggest that's the right way to do it if

510
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,770
you like stride and red do it get
started and I are gonna talk about that

511
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:13,089
tomorrow just do it I'm not a big fan of
those but that is not a comment about

512
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:19,359
their efficacy it's only a comment about
stylistic preference ok but I like

513
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:25,430
visual because it puts me understanding
where my attack surfaces in the general

514
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:30,419
structure of the architecture and so I'm
very fond of visual representations and

515
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,440
I also tend to take whatever

516
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,960
architects give me and then try to work
with that so that they understand where

517
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,760
I'm going so because it's an interactive
process that's a stylistic thing based

518
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,230
on my kind of work and the way in the
kinds of architectures I need to look at

519
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:50,890
but you may be different so you see I
use these little red hearts and

520
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,078
literally I do that again a red marker
and I mark on the thing and I say I

521
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,859
think that is back surface here I think
there's an attack surface here ok don't

522
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,119
ever forget your date you're you're
controlling data like configuration

523
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:08,029
either alright I'm just gonna go through
this a little faster the data sources as

524
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:12,299
was pointed out by John are wickedly
important because they might hold

525
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:17,580
attacks as they take on trusted data
alright

526
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:23,020
where am I now we put some users in here
are there some attack surface is here I

527
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,550
was gonna go through this really fast

528
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:30,220
obviously there are so this system has
to protect itself from those things as

529
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:36,049
well and that pretty much gets us to the
thorniest problem here I don't think I

530
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:40,700
have time for this but you can talk to
me afterwards the identity services is a

531
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,450
very thorny little problem that would be
worth if I had lots of time to go over

532
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:57,339
well sure that's very true but its
identity oh yes it is thank you this is

533
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:04,400
this is a this this flight deck is a is
a class in information so as I said Saul

534
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,680
experiment alright I will say one last
thing and then I'm just gonna turn it

535
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,620
over to you getting requirements into
implemented as an entirely different

536
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,740
story and lots of work needs to be done
there

537
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:23,629
composing the requirements well will
help but that's a distinct discipline

538
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:27,620
I'm not going to go into it today you'll
notice I just dodged a whole bunch of

539
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:33,109
typical threat modeling issues dodge
those bullets I have those are stylistic

540
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,380
preferences not necessarily writer on
and little shameless self-promotion have

541
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,570
books out there yes I will sign your
books if you can catch me and here's a

542
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,160
bunch of ways to contact me and to find
out about what I'm doing and where I am

543
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:52,350
I will tell you one thing though if we
haven't had a meaningful interaction and

544
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,000
you send me a LinkedIn friendship I will
ignore it because I try to keep my

545
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,770
LinkedIn to people I actually have
interacted with real and so when you

546
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:05,270
look at who I'm connected with on
LinkedIn those are all real people that

547
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,440
I know they're not you know people who
just want to be cooked to me because I

548
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,660
wrote a stupid book so we're we're
supposed to be done but it's the end of

549
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,180
the day so I think we can carry on any
questions

550
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,430
I would you know what John from you I
would say yes because we've had lots of

551
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:51,270
meaningful the directive yeah yeah yeah
you know let's go back because that was

552
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:58,619
actually hold that there are there are
in fact I dodged that bullet in this

553
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,099
talk because they didn't want to go down
it because message buses are a whole

554
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:08,790
whole thing in the book I talk a lot on
this architecture about a good security

555
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,980
model would deal with this problem and
actually a good way to deal that a good

556
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,570
defenses you have whatever you take in
from here you never pass through here

557
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,980
you recompose as a as a you know you use
of course use light bedded libraries and

558
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,740
whatever but you recompose and you also
have to have a lot of somebody else said

559
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:31,609
it you have a lot of restrictions on
this guy so that only traffic only goes

560
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:36,609
to intended places and its limited NURS
authenticate to the bus all of those are

561
00:52:36,609 --> 00:52:43,750
message bus you know security things
that you need to to conscience and I

562
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,290
kinda skipped over that because I felt
like you know I can only do so much in

563
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:51,080
15 minutes or whatever but you're
absolutely right

564
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,368
any other questions let me go back to
the question answers like yessir

565
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:20,060
that never happens does it that never
happens

566
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:25,680
yes so that's where the fractal part of
this comes in where you have to look

567
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,000
holistically and then that opens up
another threat like that happens all the

568
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,619
time and you have to then say okay my
threat model is incomplete life retinal

569
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:39,760
needs to account for just as it needs to
account for the message bus in fact you

570
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,500
also need to account for that I actually
go into a situation like that one of my

571
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,790
examples has that kind of thing where
they had a payment processor and

572
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:51,579
suddenly it changes the whole threat
model yeah very true and really I what I

573
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:57,570
do is I step back and say okay here's
more stuff so people often ask me so

574
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:02,190
what about when the threat model happens
at the very end we're going to talk

575
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:06,859
about that tomorrow maybe I shouldn't
give that away now I won't give it away

576
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:09,410
come to our talk tomorrow we'll talk
about what happens we get the threat

577
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,410
model or when you get a big change at
the end

578
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:28,700
and then shipping it to gosh knows where
ya i you know i play a really long game

579
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:35,210
and only when something is really really
terrible do i do I call follow and say

580
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:40,380
no that's a personal style because I
have to get along with my sister and

581
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,070
brother architects or they will just
disinvited from the party was a lot of

582
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:48,150
little personal stuff here you have to
find your own style so I play a long

583
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,440
game I say okay well we'll write an
exception now but we're going to we're

584
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,670
gonna threat model that we're going to
find out what did you know because it's

585
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:59,680
already exists you know and and I kind
of try to play a really long game

586
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,330
your style may be different or your
organization may require a different you

587
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,950
know response than that I think that's
very very unique to the experience you

588
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:16,080
know if I found out that you know the
data were all sitting you know on public

589
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,670
web server and that's where it was being
shipped to with open FTP anonymous FTP

590
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,070
my reaction would be very different like
over my dead body and we're going to

591
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:31,560
move one inch further you know I think
it's very highly dependent you know but

592
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,810
but I would caution anybody whatever
powers you have to say no use them

593
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:41,770
wisely because if you get disinvited to
the party one of my metrics that I use

594
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:46,160
because I have seventy architects that I
actually work with and lead and one of

595
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,609
the metrics I use is do they get invited
after you know I think continually being

596
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:57,130
invited and seen as as adding value
because that's a problem so if you get

597
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,940
to what I want grumpy with people

598
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:08,180
yeah yeah that people just this invite
you smart developers disinvited any

599
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:13,509
other questions or you can you can talk
to me after the session if you like I'm

600
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,360
here and I'm here tomorrow to ordering
reception
