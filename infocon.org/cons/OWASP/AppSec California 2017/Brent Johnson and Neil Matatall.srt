439
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:48,300
minute and immediately the roles of fact

440
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,399
what happens what was the problem the

441
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,620

442
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,430
should have we did a lot of

443
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,159
Investigation figure out why it did not

444
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:01,320
for every incident takes the problem

445
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,630
diagnosed in fact notify those affected

446
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and make a public statement people</font>

so now what are we accomplish even

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go over a couple examples so</font>

492
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:13,869
just bear with me while I ramble for a

493
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:15,369
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a martyr dinner did we</font>

494
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,650
get how to implement its led resource

integrity we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were done and so</font>

496
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,400
they got a bounding report about the

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything why doesn't the browser stay</font>

500
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,930
use of resource integrity have a modes

501
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,270
that you require sub resource identity

502
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,069
for everything so I don't recall if we

503
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,200
compose it or we push for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or whatever</font>

504
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,390
but it eventually happened I believe

505
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's going to be in browsers without</font>

00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">flies soon another example that happen</font>

507
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:50,020
well more quickly would be foraging and

508
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:52,210
cross large and refer policy github

still plugging holes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with if you had a</font>

515
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:09,609
now delete the existence that revert to

516
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,530
the external host it's not good then I

517
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,470
can't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> exact options at the time</font>

518
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,540
we tried it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in clemente origin policy</font>

519
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:19,629
such that for all cases the only value

00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:22,660
for reverb would be give up calm a 60s

521

github com unfortunately that breaks a

522
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,290
very important feature at ruby on rails

523
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">moon's redirects for that such as you</font>

527
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,930

cross-origin came from and it does

531
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:49,120
exactly that and we implemented it and

532
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,830
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great success another devil from</font>

exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened this unfortunately</font>

556
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,960
I think delayed content security policy

level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 for a little while and</font>

558

proportionately by the time that was

559
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,848
ready we had moved away from cashing

560

that fragment but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

good<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something I'm really pushing for</font>

562
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,180
now is what's called like hashes for

563
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:03,890

why can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just specify the hash of</font>

other's toes you guys you guys

611
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,368
ok we have response to the conventional

reporter within seconds of each other

613
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:50,049
that's in two different people who might

00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">be two different things that's not good</font>

615
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:54,259
the other benefit is defining this role

00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,299
in separating things<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like when it's</font>

combination of shit is obviously better

628
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:26,539
and don't do the working load you don't

a bad job or at least not the best job

631
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,538
could be doing the best part is if

632
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,519
you're just honest about what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

639
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:51,680
sort of talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that after a few</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can like a year it helps</font>

646
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,430

requisitions is that your development

709
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,279
staff starts to diversify all these

710
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,380
technologies that you haven't bless are

711
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:40,880
not a part of your staff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you go</font>

down overnight but other results you can

715
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,630
consolidate your development study I

716
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:52,279
think we did a really good job here add

717
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,900
a vapor decomposing and monolithic

718

720
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:00,339
there was a common platform to build

732
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,370
our last chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really really stick</font>

812
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,670
you're not going to touch everything and

813
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,619
it could buggy down<font color="#CCCCCC"> mana for a little</font>

814
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:43,140
while and doesn't get exploited it's not

815
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bad thing when we explain a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buzz of</font>

818
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,200
and stopping the country will ruin<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

embracing that culture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leveraging it</font>

821
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,130
just is amazing I think the plague

more secure too oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

828
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:28,819
I mean recommend react as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>
