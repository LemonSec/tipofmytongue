fortunate to have David rook from Riot

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,190

22
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,470
beach and the Sun<font color="#CCCCCC"> or someone who's been</font>

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:12,410
living in Ireland for 11 years is it is

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,210
a big appeal I think the venue that you

25
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,810
guys have for this conference is always

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:20,509
fantastic it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unique XE and you're</font>

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,798
for three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different reasons really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,049
know where is the location as they said

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,979
secondly is the speakers that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

32

here very high quality set of speakers

33
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:40,070
so many big names in the industry

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,630
deliver fantastic twigs and for me for

35
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first time today I was that actually</font>

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,429
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a training course here at</font>

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">upset Kelly a nursery of those things</font>

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,049
come together to make me wanna come all

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this way that's great to hear thank</font>

40
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:57,770
you one question I'd like to ask him

41
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,950
it's crazy the way things change rapidly

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:04,520
in our field and you have any thoughts

43
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,130
and advice about where you think the the

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">next big trends or hits or threats are</font>

45
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:13,970
coming from and what your what your

46
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,040
looking forward to it I think I always

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,260
shall I<font color="#CCCCCC"> for making predictions of any</font>

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,989
kind because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're as wrong when</font>

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,630
they make predictions all the time I

50
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

51
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,930
absolute still needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at some of</font>

52
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,970
its fundamentals and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think probably</font>

53
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,460
every company and needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

54
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,100
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and I mean for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to for</font>

55
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,710
the really big areas is around third

56
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,970
party code that using the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

57
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,220
know when we look at application

58
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,820
security we often look at the code that

59
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">we create as an organization but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

60
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,870
reality that's actually very tiny part

61
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,530
of the things we actually ship as a

62
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,780
product and so I think we start to see

63
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,150
more of a focus on that area of security

64
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,330
you know analyzing<font color="#CCCCCC"> third party libraries</font>

65
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,110
we use and so on I think automation full

66
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:04,720
stop we need to do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more off across</font>

67
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,350
our industry right we we I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at I'm</font>

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,990
still rely too much on humans and whilst

69
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,000
humans are very good we don't scale very

70
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,040
well and so I think the more automation

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,840
we can bring into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bella and then I think</font>

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,989
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the softer side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,300
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really focus on understanding</font>

74
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,460
developers needs and try and develop

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,140
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those developers into security</font>

76
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,200
champions to help us really scale

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,390
application security yeah we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,690
have all of you that are involved in

79
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,359
this great field we're in to be

80
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,160
evangelists and help spread the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word so</font>

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,930
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to thank David</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>
