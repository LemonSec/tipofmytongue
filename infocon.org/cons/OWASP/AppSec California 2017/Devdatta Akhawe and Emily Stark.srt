00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,880
really what what an attacker wants to

is they might accidentally issue a

certificate for your domain that you can

62
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,180
authorize and then there's a specific

63
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,790
floating around out there that can be

64
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,260
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an impact some use to prove</font>

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,649
this example a part of it turns out a

<font color="#E5E5E5">little small there but in this example</font>

73
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,579
we have a researcher who basically found

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:26,200
a P&S miss configuration on a sub domain

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,169
researcher has gotten to this point it

79
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,660
would have been pretty trivial for them

80
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:42,489
to obtain a certificate for this domain

81
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:44,139
and so even after Emma<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben had</font>

discovered and practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

the subdomain that has briefly been

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:59,859
under the attackers control so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

87
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,599
is when Sally the server operator and

having her nightmares at night she's

89
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,948
worried about high-value data like your

showing these in Crohn's it's a bad us

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,830
you know the users want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what they</font>

want to do whether they're happy days or

users don't know what this means they're

475

mostly looking for the like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me</font>

weird errors<font color="#CCCCCC"> they see sometimes when</font>

481
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,700
they decide

482
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,440
see them and that ends up turning to

483
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,809
visit them in long run because when

484

users TV they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that this</font>

means there is something very fishy

486
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,590
going on so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to implement</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">months pay for right away because we</font>

488
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,480
think that would cause a lot of things

489
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,970
and that's gonna tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little bit</font>

490

more about about why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that in</font>

491
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,440
short it's actually pretty hard to

492
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:30,590
deploy oginski stable and Goliath in

493
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:32,899
today and also in addition to being kind

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,340
of difficult to desired properly also

495
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,928
I'm just kind of difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

496
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,570
whether you've done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

497
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:41,720
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you can on an</font>

498
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,428
opp favoring in your servers how does it

499
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,159
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're actually reliably</font>

500

delivering fresh valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sweet they</font>

501
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,980
hold on every connection how do you know

502
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:52,039
that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing a bunch of</font>

503
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,309
errors and how do you how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

504
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients or networks are actually</font>

505
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:59,269
allowing those to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be validated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> properly</font>

506
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,870
and again that will serve a little bit

507
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:05,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">more detail about about what I can can</font>

508
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:07,158
but this visibility is measuring as you

509
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:08,960
see fit bernie is why and probably

510
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,480
introduced this experimental feature

511
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,429
called expect able<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead a month</font>

512
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,740
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like expected for me like</font>

513
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:18,080
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to require that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

514
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,840
the table table 250 response but we

515
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,490
really expected you and it's an

516
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,320
experimental feature where you can opt

517
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,169
in on the debate tournaments with the

518
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">sides and chrome and once you've often</font>

519
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:34,549
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> tight we do basically a report</font>

520
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:37,460
only version of my stable so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we as we</font>

521
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:39,408
connect to your site and your site

522
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,659
adopted in and that that connection

523
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,570
doesn't come along with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> salad OTP</font>

524
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,820
response it will do it then chrome will

525
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,279
send a report to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

526
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,009
location<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your choosing in stating</font>

527
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there was a problem it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

528
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:56,659
like a trial run version of month<font color="#E5E5E5"> April</font>

529
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,459
we won't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail connections if</font>

530
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:01,220
you aren't delivering<font color="#CCCCCC"> oqc responsive</font>

531
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,080
properly but we will we will send a

532
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:09,260
report so that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about failures</font>

533
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:11,769
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with that then is</font>

534
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,809
going to now give even background about

535
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:24,519
how God Fox has the river just recently

536
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:27,830
and expect people all right hi and then

537
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,330
secondly<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect now I bother no it's</font>

538
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i'm not that would it be good</font>

539
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,960
but i'll be looking outside here<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

540
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,350
so you all know you can decide like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

541
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,940
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> she said was good be as you</font>

542
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,090
all know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in violent agreement</font>

543
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,450
is everything closed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it will talk</font>

544
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:51,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is the cycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uses all</font>

545
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,659
right so out of the box you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Capt</font>

546
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,980
win support in either you're in the next

547
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:59,360
panting<font color="#CCCCCC"> sauce is amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work very well</font>

548
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:02,510
first issue is when we started looking

549
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,820
at this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> poking irresponsible which</font>

550
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">lead to get the title so if you set up</font>

551
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the next to use obviously tapered</font>

552
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field office it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually it can</font>

553
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,809
actually people<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for deity responses</font>

554
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,059
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four different but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

555
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,700
personal physical going on to be a hey

556
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:21,049
give me do tht response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sable if you</font>

the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in to respond to the</font>

639
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to the code we have on it hopefully</font>

640
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:46,359
with a little bit because some people

are cooking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up all right this is to</font>

create a 10-5 like legit with the reason

00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:06,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplished so both a 10-5 it is quite</font>

be 40 acres then we fetch whetstone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

649
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,889
giving if I to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the OKC responds</font>

650
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:14,738
because the ODSP openssl okc command

651
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:17,019
will get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonzero even up on purpose so</font>

652
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:20,440
you can't really expect the response of

653
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:22,210
us open at the fellow tsp cumin it also

654
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,679
likely reflecting in voltage is it looks

655
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,529
like the openssl rotate the command is

656
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,049
very easy ap about the order of argument

657
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,729
so after Oliver figured of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact</font>

658
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,279
target of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the cardenas for these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

659
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:35,080
Nadia and give a second a common same

660
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,479
tone as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that is benefits of time</font>

661
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,210
itself or if you do it on to make sure

662
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:44,739
you can fit properly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also</font>

663
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,539
because I separately if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he called the</font>

664
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:48,639
openness<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ODST way if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come on it</font>

665
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,649
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> niglets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which indicated 0</font>

666
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,629
regardless of whether the unit function

667
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:56,668
valid or not so what we ended up doing

668
00:28:52,629 --> 00:29:00,248
was getting the output for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> void okay</font>

669
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:01,659
which is which is not the most noble

670
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:05,090
thing but as far as we can tell everyone

671
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:07,970
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no other option</font>

672
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,350
so now hopefully they still be in common

673
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,450
to committing you why you need something

00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,470
I want to focus on and so what that

861
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,930
means is that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this</font>

00:37:53,850 --> 00:38:02,100
is what they did and minus n git and so

869

sort of errors wouldn't find peace and

896
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,259
without actually in fact that any of our

897
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,420
users in terms of thousands we know that

<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanna try to switch to be</font>

900
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like hit errors all the time so the site</font>

arcadia agencies are not physical

904
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:42,550
ultimately you can bypass the boarding

area so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be yes</font>

906
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:51,970
so I think if its realization and I can

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out as with this we usually play</font>

that I can share doesn't look so

915
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:15,430
exciting yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it is so this is</font>

than proposed this protocol requires an

effect which is contributed content of

the client's website is you know

00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,950
sometimes a minute let's use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

big relief unknown phenomena so so like

927
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,540
that should not make audiences a plane

928
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,770
in that should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go like shopping d</font>

it's already a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because we</font>

figured my services allow by hunting

Gators here is to get in all variations

934

you're interested very good I was when

937
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,430
we configure the wreck happened I think

938
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is really a problem with it</font>

939
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,669
looks like we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an OTP response page</font>

940
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,460
that says the difficult value

941
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,590
proposition that if EPA has gone coming

those are big it is invalid is invalid

944
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,460
now also think we should insist on the

945
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:28,360
path again depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems by type</font>
