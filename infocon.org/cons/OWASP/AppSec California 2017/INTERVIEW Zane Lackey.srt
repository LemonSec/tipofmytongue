26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,570
years and the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach security</font>

began myself excluded obviously but

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,530
overall great it's kind of the perfect

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,109
size of conference in my head of you've

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,149
got a nice bit of diversity of folks

37
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,458
here but it's still small enough where

38
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,109
you can actually meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks and talk to</font>

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,369
other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> other practitioners that</font>

41
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,990
space without being overwhelmed like you

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,189
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a 10,000 person event and</font>

44
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,148
absolutely amazing there's no place

45
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:53,219
better to be really anytime but

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,649
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> January you like being at the</font>
