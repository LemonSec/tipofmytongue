1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,859
we'll talk a little bit about passwords

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:22,470
the history where we are where we're

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:25,740
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> so just a click show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you remember all your passwords</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,369
remember all your passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you do</font>

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,899
Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Man anybody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raised</font>

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">my hand but I can't remember all my</font>

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,570
passwords it could be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray hair but</font>

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,550
I wasn't that<font color="#CCCCCC"> good you know 20 years ago</font>

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,870
either so here's an interesting thing

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,870
then how many passwords do you have

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,870
three passwords thank you very much so

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,879
that's actually kind of interesting a

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,559
little bit about my background I know

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,890
they mentioned the bio so what's

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,408
interesting that you may want to know is

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,840
i'm the inventor of two patents issued

18
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,510
patents and one pending patent on

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,790
eliminating passwords and in mobile

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,140
payments so we've done a fair amount of

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,920
work I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working in this area for</font>

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last four years so take that with a</font>

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,330
grain of salt so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where my</font>

24
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:30,840
my thoughts and opinions are coming from

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:34,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful if we</font>

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,880
went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what got password started</font>

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,799
what was the idea behind it right

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,229
because you know things have changed

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,820
passwords were invented in nineteen

30
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,130
sixty one fifty six years ago ok now the

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,279
history of computing you know five years

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">a long time 50 years is it really really</font>

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">long time so and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was on the first</font>

34
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,119
time sharing system at MIT and and and

35
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,429
the environment was such that you know

36
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,829
you pass through a security guard you

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,960
get enter into a secure room because you

38
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,899
know those idea main things were really

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,840
expensive time is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive and all</font>

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,650
you wanted to do protect yourself from

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten to</font>

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,129
tool in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a</font>

43
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,379
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protection that was needed</font>

44
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:25,530
but today I things are a little

45
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,560
different passwords were not designed to

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,769
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> us from automated attacks</font>

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,180
fishing social hacking that I mean those

48
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,739
are all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,019
through today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think that a user</font>

50
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:42,650
ID password is going to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but</font>

51
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,650
it was never<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed to do that so</font>

52
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:49,650
passwords are hearing more complex

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,569
anybody noticed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you need to</font>

54
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,690
have uppercase lowercase symbol number

55
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,849
that's no news what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,590
long they're getting because the longer

57
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,709
they are is the more complex they are

58
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,389
it's a harder to remember part so go

59
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,310
daddy they knew minimum is 12 characters

60
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:11,430
Freddie Mac less than L which is one of

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">our clients 16 character minimums for</font>

62
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,409
sure the past and actually they created

63
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,790
in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Allah created a new</font>

64
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:24,959
server for us and password were 33

65
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,810
character I'm not like 33 characters it

66
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,150
was extremely safe because every time we

67
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,099
typed it there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a typo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

68
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually the server was locked up we</font>

69
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">could never log into it so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,340
extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> sick but it got nothing done</font>

71
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:43,500
so again with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that going on I think</font>

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you for remembering all your three</font>

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:51,629
passwords but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're getting into a</font>

74
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,760
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area okay another</font>

75
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,198
interesting side on the fraud if you

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,138
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it two out of three data</font>

77
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,709
breaches are from stolen a login

78
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:06,120
credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as compared to last</font>

79
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:08,940
year in 2016 as compared to 2015 fraud

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,599
attempts are up by fifty percent now

81
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:16,199
that's huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay more so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just about</font>

82
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,940
any other year also the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of</font>

83
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,560
the data beach is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher and</font>

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,570
higher it's on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average of about</font>

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven million dollars for data breach</font>

86
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,849
now you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those data breaches</font>

87
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,360
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven million bucks even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for most</font>

you're in the healthcare business then

91

you've got fines and other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

92
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,948
something that's happening so why is all

93
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,469
this stuff happening right there's a

00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:09,240
passwords store so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is bad right the</font>

146
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,039
numbers are staggering<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there over</font>

147
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,099
two and a half million passwords that

148
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,289
are stolen user IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and passwords stolen</font>

149
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,110
and I think there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> another number 3.3</font>

150
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:23,130
million whatever it is it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

151
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,650
humongous number right so ah and the

152
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every company and</font>

153
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,539
every government agency can and probably

154
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,409
will be hacked at some point okay

155
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">including FBI CIA and some of the other</font>

156
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,810
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the hackers are ranging</font>

157
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,989
from either professional or amateur

158
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,580
individual hackers we've seen those

159
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,719
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> researchers kind of getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

160
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,960
there and they may or may not use the

information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good purpose organized</font>

162
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,419
and not so organized crime that's huge

163
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,440
financial motive is the biggest driver

164
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:04,680
and then we got industrial spies<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edwards</font>

165

case in Orange County of buddy knows if

you plan on<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you guys heard their news</font>

terrorist groups and spy agencies like

170
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,360
in the case of OPM so this stuff is

171
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,479
getting more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

most on all their sites the way the case

three passwords on if you're the average

188

ma'am you've got hundred and eight

191
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:20,130
pattern here that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to be a</font>

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,540
problem because<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunter making any</font>

passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost impossible and and some</font>

194
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,110
of us are using algorithmic passwords

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,660
anybody uses algorithmic unique

196
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,420
passwords per se yeah that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

197
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're taught right so use some kind</font>

198
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,459
of an algorithm a keyword and something

199
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,880
site-specific so for every<font color="#CCCCCC"> site you'll</font>

200
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,190
have unique algorithm great let's say

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,490
I'm using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack to yahoo for my yahoo</font>

202
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,860
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then i'm using jack to</font>

203
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,770
google for my google account Jack to

204

citibank for<font color="#E5E5E5"> citibank can anybody guess</font>

205
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,260
what my chase password and going to be a

206
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,650
quick show hand it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

207
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,500
it really is it so once they know a few

208
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:08,339
of your password they know all of your

209
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,140
pastor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so sometimes being smart can</font>

210
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,440
actually work against you this is one of

211
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,330
those cases so I make this case I mean

212
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,430
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind-shattering here or</font>

213
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,010
shattering here but but you realize when

214
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,469
you add all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts together there's</font>

215
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,760
getting to be a pretty strong case now

216
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,440
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

217
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,220
keyboard loggers just a quick show of

218
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,250
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a lot of you are wonderful so</font>

219
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,510
you have a keyboard lager and try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font>

220
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">in and the keyboard lager gets in there</font>

221
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:44,430
they get it ok so does it matter how

222
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,830
complex my password is if I have a

223
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,209
keyboard lager it's capturing for the

224
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,800
people is on the keyboard loggers

225
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,439
captured every single character data

226
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,050
type and then eventually they send it so

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,620
does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how complex how secure my</font>

228
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,290
password is even

229
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,120
that 33 character password the lesson

230
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Donald gave us would have been</font>

231
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,920
compromised in the situation so you have

232
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,980
no protection and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way keyboard</font>

233
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,110
loggers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so bad I heard that there</font>

234
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,760
are about 200 new various that hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

235
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:21,140
mark identity so it's it's getting to be

236
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,920
a major issue so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I capturing</font>

237
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:28,010
everything any computer one of my type

WWE Bank of America<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm what's the next</font>

239
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,610
thing I'm going to tell anybody can

240
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:39,260
guess not hard not hard right by user ID

241
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:42,980
and password ah and in as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I type</font>

242
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,200
it my<font color="#E5E5E5"> password as i said the complexity</font>

243
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,900
is irrelevant so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

244
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,570
something else if I if if you're a

245
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,810
keyboard logger and you shall a 16-digit

246
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:58,250
number that started with five anybody

247
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:00,319
know what that is it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> MasterCard what</font>

248
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:06,350
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 16-digit number that starts well</font>

249
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,180
before it's a visa ok how many 16 digit

250
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,839
numbers are you going to see being<font color="#E5E5E5"> tied</font>

251
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,699
from a keyboard not that many 15 digit

252
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,400
start with the three just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete</font>

253
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,610
the stuff that's American Express<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

254
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,959
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have to be smart</font>

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,800
application to figure out riginal AI

256
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,339
involved here right so this stuff is

257
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,670
pretty bad it's so bad that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

258
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:34,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago an enterprising hacker in</font>

259
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:39,199
Europe took out at Yahoo banner ad

somewhat<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was very</font>

261
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular obviously cost him a lot of</font>

262
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">money as people were clicking on it but</font>

263
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,410
when he clicked on it they actually want

264
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,650
to a site which tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to infect the</font>

265
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,790
computer with a keyboard water they were

266
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:58,400
infecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> two million computers an hour</font>

267
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:02,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so once you have that once you have</font>

268
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:08,420
their their passwords in its it's game

269
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:11,360
over how important is this now there's a

270
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,029
new NBC study that was done

271
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,089
thirty-nine percent of America would

272
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:21,019
give up sex for a year to never have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

273
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:23,540
worry about being half given up sex

274
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:25,339
right that's that's tough sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

275
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the out of curiosity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of you</font>

276
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,740
would give<font color="#E5E5E5"> up sex for you not to be ever</font>

277
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:35,930
had for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life okay well</font>

278
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,760
text is important then okay fine so if

279
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:42,109
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is wrong with a survey oh it's</font>

280
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,569
NBC News so okay maybe they're right but

281
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,010
maybe it's not thirty-nine percent maybe

282
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,050
it's thirty-five percent maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

283
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:52,130
forty two percent I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

284
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,979
a staggering<font color="#E5E5E5"> number okay because the sex</font>

285
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:59,120
for a year is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable thing to</font>

286
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:05,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">have at least one I last heard of it so</font>

287
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:08,140
ah so what's the best long-term solution

288
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:14,390
getting more complex password eat it

289
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:17,990
right we need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so we use</font>

290
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:21,199
the carts the horse<font color="#E5E5E5"> carts that we need</font>

291
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,199
automobile okay we use candles that we

292
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,319
need electricity we need lens so the

293
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:31,240
best long-term solution is to get rid of

294
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,220
password is to eliminate passwords why

295
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,550
because if you don't have a password it

296
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,050
can't be stolen I think about it you

297
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:43,969
can't feel something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't exist</font>

298
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:46,760
and the plus side is if you eliminate

299
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,790
passwords you<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower the link sixty-seven</font>

300
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,250
percent of the data breaches that's not

301
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,459
quite 8020 rule but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge amount</font>

302
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,769
right because sixty-seven percent of the

303
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,170
data breaches are bad actors coming in

304
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:02,209
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front door if you take the</font>

305
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:08,719
passwords away all those stolen

306
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:12,170
passwords are meaningless so now that's

307
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:21,170
a good idea jack but in others now

308
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:23,180
there's reality right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me tell</font>

309
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,469
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real life</font>

310
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,859
examples all

311
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,650
if we had eliminated passwords how would

312
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,810
it work what would it<font color="#CCCCCC"> did anybody</font>

313
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,500
familiar with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Podesta email</font>

314
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:39,849
hack get there are a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people or</font>

315
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:43,880

educated IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> flips so can't blame them it</font>

347
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:09,819

349
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:18,730
from work then once you have all those

350
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:23,120
email accounts that are that have been

351
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,920
hacked they have a contactless right say

352
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,419
the email account has to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> contacted</font>

353
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,270
so you know who your friends and your

354
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,610
family are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might actually have some</font>

355
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,360
interesting content in there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font>

356
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">what they do they take your people in</font>

357
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,949
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they actually send</font>

358
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,380
a picture or an attachment something

359
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,990
that kind of fits<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay something</font>

360
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,370
you'd want to know and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

361
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,250
send it to people that have gmail

362
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:52,189
accounts for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google accounts so what</font>

363
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,430
happens is if you click on it is a page

364
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,800
comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can't see from the</font>

365
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,890
bottom but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right on the bottom in the</font>

366
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,379
URL it basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> says data text and then</font>

367
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:06,950
there's HTML but you very clearly see

368
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:10,730
there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS calling / /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

369
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,800
google com service logic so it's got the

370
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,530
right URL in it but it looks a little

371
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,340
funny and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe you're not sure</font>

372
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:22,220
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot see is all got extra</font>

373
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,610
space after the red<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrow and then</font>

374
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,770
there's a script and unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

375
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,490
know the location bar is not big enough

376
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,780
long enough to show everything to you

377
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:37,430
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you click on that</font>

378
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:40,129
attachment okay you get this login page

379
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,370
it says hey you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign in to your</font>

380
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google account to be able to see this</font>

381
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:49,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay as soon as you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've got your</font>

382
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:53,420
password so what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen if we</font>

383
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,040
didn't have passwords so if you don't

384
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a password that you can eliminate</font>

385
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,260
the data breaches from phishing attacks

386
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,820
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you'll obviously if you don't</font>

387
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,310
have a password somebody asks for your

388
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,320
passwords then you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay why they</font>

389
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked them to my password it fits the</font>

390
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,389
old stuff we're not using passwords

391
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:14,990
anymore and even somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks on it</font>

392
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:17,570
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> password to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enter and even if</font>

393
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,640
you have untrained users who were not

394
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,919
taught how to deal with situations like

395
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,380
this they can do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

396
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,960
don't have a password to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter so you</font>

397
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,780
can see that logically how that thing

398
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,540
fits in that we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid</font>

399
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,510
of passwords passwords are not saving us

400
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,639
and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you would agree I'm so far I</font>

401
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,860
haven't met anybody who likes passwords

402
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,000
maybe I'm wrong haven't met anybody who

403
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,469
loves passwords anybody nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,530
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold them pretty pretty</font>

405
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,820
true so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font>

406
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:55,918
passwords how can we do

407
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:59,460
right ah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get little passwords by</font>

408
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:04,679
turning our phones into our digital

409
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:07,409
identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because everyone almost</font>

410
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,509
everyone has one and we all miss Kay

411
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,700
I'll always carry our phones with us

412
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:14,370
they can click show of hands who doesn't

413
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:19,409
have their cell phone on them you don't

414
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:25,100
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell me why I'm</font>

415
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:28,460
sorry what okay okay anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

416
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:32,549
doesn't have their phones on them okay

417
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:35,220
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh for most people they will they</font>

418
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,090
will carry their phones with them that's

419
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:42,690
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but typically it it works</font>

420
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:44,699
fairly local people so how do you over

421
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:49,799
many passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm going to give</font>

422
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,909
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 10,000 a foot view of it and but</font>

423
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is something you can take and</font>

424
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:56,820
implement yourself if you want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

425
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,980
so basically you send a login request to

426
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">your smartphone and you could use that</font>

427
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:05,429
using a QR or<font color="#E5E5E5"> push image or sound waves</font>

428
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:07,620
electromagnetic waves or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> emc if</font>

429
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,110
you're close by and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify</font>

430
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,330
identity there are two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy</font>

431
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,158
ways that you can do this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

432
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:19,559
encryption and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other wise the other</font>

433
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,899
one is device fingerprinting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if</font>

434
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,700
you use encryption key key is usually

435
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,129
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> commonly use encryption method</font>

436
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,909
for that so you'll use you'll store your

437
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:31,769
user ID on your phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you'll</font>

438
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:34,889
encrypt the user ID with the server's

439
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:37,080
public key and and then you send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

440
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:40,590
the server server and<font color="#CCCCCC"> clips eclipse it</font>

441
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,500
with their private key and if if it be

442
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">quips then hey it's who you say you are</font>

443
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:50,129
then they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

444
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:53,939
very simple very straightforward ah the

445
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:56,549
downside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of encryption is that the data</font>

446
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,460
and encryption keys can easily be copied

447
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:02,639
or stolen you can restore a backup and

448
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,050
then get the data falls out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there you</font>

449
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:06,990
can copy the app data

450
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">from rooted or jailbroken phones and</font>

451
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,420
there's some malware that will go across

452
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:15,090
our boundaries and infection data the

453
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:18,300
problem is if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your keys then</font>

454
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,070
they have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's kind of the</font>

455
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the worst part is you thought that you</font>

456
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,500
were safe but they stole your your

457
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,810
certificates your user ID and and now

458
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,850
you're you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deeper duty than you</font>

459
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:33,810
were before because now they can pretend

460
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:36,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be you everywhere if we use device</font>

461
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,149
fingerprinting which is in my opinion a

462
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:43,920
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> safer you are aware that every</font>

463
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:47,700
smartphone every smartphone has a unique

464
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,740
hardware right anybody about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pic</font>

465
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you afterwards and I'll show you why</font>

466
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,930
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so if you read the hardware</font>

467
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,700
information off your device that

468
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,850
information cannot be falsified and

469
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,320
that's a great thing for for identity

470
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,750
and then you take that device

471
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,179
fingerprint whatever factor you look at

472
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,870
you associate that with a user now you

473
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,430
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much more robust way of</font>

474
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,320
identifying who the user is and you

475
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,440
can't really crack that thing that's

476
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,820
much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than encryption based</font>

477
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:25,850
solutions the downside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of device</font>

478
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:32,639
fingerprinting is if he takes my phone

479
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">use me right he's got my device so i</font>

480
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,720
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the other part is if i</font>

481
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,520
change my phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> then i got a different</font>

482
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,040
device in the print and i have to go

483
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,580
through an association process again but

484
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,490
a significant step over encryption

485
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:53,699
processes that work today all day<font color="#CCCCCC"> a duo</font>

486
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:56,970
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> google authenticators they're all</font>

487
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,260
based on encryption ok so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vice</font>

488
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,160
fingerprinting i think is a little

489
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:04,920
superior to that now what we do at

490
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,900
secure me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll share our secret we do is</font>

491
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,330
we use dynamic mobile device

492
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,360
fingerprinting because as you know as i

493
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,720
mentioned every phone is unique every

494
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,439
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> is unique right so if you combine</font>

495
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,179
the arm if you

496
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,100
by you plus your phone then you get a

497
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:27,279
unique mobile fingerprint that's tamper

498
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,449
proof and that's individualize so if he

499
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,190
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to steal my phone or find my phone</font>

500
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,940
he can't log in as me because he's not

501
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:40,600
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's that's a much better</font>

502
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:43,990
level of security now anybody interested

503
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">in creating your own way of eliminating</font>

504
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:51,820
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they've at least one by</font>

505
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:54,730
so are what I recommend is you can do

506
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,418
this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation is not extremely</font>

507
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:01,120
hard the user experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

508
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,620
significantly more effort because you

509
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,600
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it nice and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

510
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:10,029
use password and and patents are

511
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,678
significant barrier to entry now as

512
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:13,840
technologists that's probably the last

513
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,759
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to look at but if you ever</font>

514
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the lawsuits that are going on</font>

515
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,750
god forbid if you do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

516
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,179
fringes when somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's patent and</font>

517
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,070
then you're successful then you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

518
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:26,169
to pee and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're large amounts of</font>

519
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,870
money that I've been talking about the

520
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:31,450
bad news<font color="#CCCCCC"> is password list login is very</font>

521
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:34,178
heavily patented and most approaches are

522
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:37,659
already patented so if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

523
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:39,700
do your own highly recommend you or

524
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:41,889
somebody else preferably just do a

525
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,879
patent research and find out what's been

526
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:47,620
patented in the final way around it or

527
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:49,240
you could you could consider licensing

528
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of those patents and then you could</font>

529
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,059
avoid litigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now we're at the</font>

530
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun part anybody want to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a live</font>

531
00:25:55,059 --> 00:26:01,299
action<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in all right let's get there</font>

532
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:10,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">now let me switch to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a browser i'm going</font>

533
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:13,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you if I can so I'm going to</font>

534
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,889
show you a live demo

535
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard time all right</font>

536
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:34,810
so this is uh it's a bit fuzzy can you

537
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,399
see back there and it's kind of rough

538
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let me give you the lay of the land</font>

539
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,880
this is a my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the</font>

540
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,910
only thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about</font>

541
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,510
other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 3d pictures is on the</font>

542
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:51,460
login side it says there's a user ID

543
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,890
password that you cannot see which is

544
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the typical logon and then there's a</font>

545
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,280
blue button can you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue button</font>

546
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,020
back there don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what it</font>

547
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,629
says like you can see the blue book that

548
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:06,790
one says login with secure me I'm sorry

549
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:10,090
what there is one ok existence confirmed

550
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:12,129
thank you sir so what I'm going to do is

551
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,770
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to log in without user IDs and</font>

552
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,650
passwords so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do is click on that</font>

553
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:20,560
button as you notice i see a QR code now

554
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually have an</font>

555
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,840
application here now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

556
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:28,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that nobody else can use that i'm going</font>

557
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,360
to attend to keep it nice a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

558
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:41,409
that only keeps people away so we scan

559
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:42,790
the QR code hello all right can I keep

560
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,220
these loud back late my phone got

561
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,760
authentic you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I logged in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now this</font>

562
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it was a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast let me</font>

563
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,210
do it again

564
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,739
okay somebody trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to count how many</font>

565
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,090
characters my password hands okay a

566
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand dollar we work to anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who'd</font>

567
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:10,189
be filming that so I have a QR code I

568
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:12,230
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> my app but i have my app fingerprint</font>

569
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:17,080
so anybody who finds my phone can't use

570
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:21,830
it quick scan hello my phone got

571
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">authenticated and logged</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it these are</font>

572
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:30,260
IDs no passwords and you notice no

573
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:33,950
attack vectors either so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have your</font>

574
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:38,120
abscess testing or seventy four percent

575
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:42,160
left attacks sixty-seven percent of your

576
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:46,459
attacks because you can't log in there

577
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:51,830
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show you one more practical</font>

578
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:55,340
example oh very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting question ah</font>

579
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:57,740
there is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific in the QR code</font>

580
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:02,000
that's specific to the side was specific

581
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,710
to the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're welcome to scan</font>

582
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,970
it anybody wants 1 i'll send you want

583
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to set of numbers that's all yes</font>

584
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:17,800
yeah yeah the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular question i</font>

585
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">always get asked is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does it work</font>

586
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,970
yeah well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't really dispose it this</font>

587
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer publicly but if you have some</font>

588
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:34,730
point questions I'll be happy to answer

589
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:37,460
them no no there is no password correct

590
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,760
but it's not a password well that's my

591
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone this is my digital identity that's</font>

592
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:49,160
what's getting authenticated<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tight</font>

593
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let me show you a more that's I has</font>

594
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,309
something to do with it that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

595
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,309
that's the device fingerprinting part i

596
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,960
actually know there's there's some

597
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:02,270
one-time stuff in there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

598
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,070
again thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for trying to you know</font>

599
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,290
break it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see how it works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

600
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,559
tell you it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

601
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">shown over a thousand demos</font>

602
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,480
that is by far the number one question

603
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:17,080
again how does it work or<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

604
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:20,740
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let me do this here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

605
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,749
one and I'm sorry my QR scanner isn't

606
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,580
scanning too well because it's a fuzzy

607
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:26,590
one so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a little closer</font>

608
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,330
I'm just trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that there's</font>

609
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,070
no connectivity said this is getting

610
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,168
authenticated I don't know if you saw my

611
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,210
phone got authenticated so we're logging

612
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,249
in somewhere hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

613
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:40,690
sitting closer by can tell me what this

614
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:43,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">website it that's correct so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

615
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:47,379
logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to gmail no passwords are you</font>

616
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:51,820
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there is actually some</font>

617
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:54,879
real live applications for them and the

618
00:30:51,820 --> 00:31:00,090
nice thing is so when I log out or when

619
00:30:54,879 --> 00:31:04,539
I do this tell me how you would try to

620
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:06,939
break into this what stolen user

621
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:11,730
credentials will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in</font>

622
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:15,909
here so once you eliminate the passwords

623
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:18,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you truly can eliminate all the all the</font>

624
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:24,960
bad bad actors trying to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

625
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:24,960
front door ok any questions on that yes

626
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:34,289
yes I'll be happy to show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

627
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,570
but i can't show it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but i'll</font>

628
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:39,149
go outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk you happy to</font>

629
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:42,149
show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you yes and basically in</font>

630
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:44,610
this case we will send you a text

631
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:45,989
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you click on it and then we</font>

632
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:52,199
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get associated</font>

633
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:54,120
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that email account yes yes if you</font>

634
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">lose your phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> das secured</font>

635
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,479
on me and are some information that

636
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,809
doesn't require your phone and say

637
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:15,830
deactivate that phone is no longer good

638
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:15,830
you don't have to reach yes yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah oh</font>

639
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">right great question well hand them</font>

640
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,190
privacy issue right because hey ah they

641
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,440
may steal your password but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

642
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,919
change it they steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fingerprint</font>

643
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:40,350
and here in trouble you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

644
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:44,129
finger right oh I'm sorry what that's

645
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,570
correct so ah leave I'm a brick big

646
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,509
proponent off if you're going to use

647
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:50,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">fingerprint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot leave the device</font>

648
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,779
so in this case it stays with the device

649
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,000
but if you don't want to use

650
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:57,269
fingerprinting perfectly fine we have a

651
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,580
pin entry so you can actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pen</font>

652
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:01,289
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a fingerprint or if you want</font>

653
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,418
to be even more secure we can do three

654
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:08,700
factor authentication by using those pin

655
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:11,190
as well as fingerprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

656
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,169
goes into how safety you want to be

657
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:17,700
versus how easy do you want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be now</font>

658
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:21,210
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you guys concur that</font>

659
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,580
this might be an easy way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login okay</font>

660
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,429
well take<font color="#CCCCCC"> my word that's actually more</font>

661
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,460
secure but and their various ways you

662
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:31,620
could do by but I can keep it the phone

663
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,600
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> pocket and I can get automatic</font>

664
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,000
two-factor authentication the doctor

665
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,559
even having to lift a finger<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

666
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,899
will not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very secure but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be very</font>

667
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,720
easy to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> or on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand I said</font>

668
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,949
we can do three

669
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,440
the authentication that requires both a

670
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:51,640
QR code sorry both figured print

671
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,240
anything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safe you want</font>

672
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,980
your your solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be from</font>

673
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,700
organization to organization either

674
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:03,970
change and on a slide down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a global</font>

675
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,039
value we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking for about a military</font>

676
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:09,099
application where they did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

677
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:12,369
fingerprint you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to enter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PIN</font>

678
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:15,550
but they also wanted to know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

679
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:18,399
in distress as somebody's holding a gun

680
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,220
to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> head you have to enter it so you</font>

681
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,618
enter a different pin which tells you

682
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:26,319
that your distress you still go I get

683
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:28,359
you get granted some access but then the

684
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">alarm bells will be ringing somewhere so</font>

685
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,109
there's a whole lot of security stuff

686
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:36,849
that you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't do with</font>

687
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:38,529
user IDs and passwords and and then you

688
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,030
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to only use three passwords</font>

689
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,790
because you know your passwords are not

690
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:46,629
still very likely heard you did you have

691
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,790
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> yahoo account thank God have you been</font>

692
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:51,009
a blue shield Blue Cross patient over

693
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:54,009
the last dozen years or so 15 years or

694
00:34:51,010 --> 00:35:00,270
so well congratulations<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password is</font>

695
00:34:54,010 --> 00:35:03,400
go so I mean with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 billion 3 billion</font>

696
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:07,839
passwords unless you change them

697
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,460
frequently they got you yes sorry let me

698
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,060
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of this gentleman then I'll</font>

699
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,060
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to you</font>

700
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,190
connection between the cell phone and

701
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,899
devices is doing to authentication my

702
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,280
question is would it work in an

703
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,010
environment that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no errors</font>

704
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,190
access to a sort of connection between

705
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cell phone and the laptop and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

706
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:38,520
other question is is there sort of

707
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,319
browser plugin that needs to be

708
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,319
installing the browser for this to work

709
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:45,300
okay yes if you're talking about

710
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:47,670
eliminating passwords and how to be able

711
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that sure you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do that</font>

712
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,060
you can work through bluetooth without

713
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,920
having to resort to the internet and

714
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,380
their various things you can do as

715
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,450
they're asking whether securely the

716
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,560
product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we built does that no it</font>

717
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:03,960
does not it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does require internet access</font>

718
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,560
so just there's so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

719
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:10,020
scenarios you just pick and choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

720
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,569
where it is that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve the</font>

721
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,460
thing now one interesting question that

722
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:16,290
I haven't showed you and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

723
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,849
hard to show on a little phone what if

724
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,359
you're using your mobile browser to

725
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:24,780
wander you can't scan a QR code with

726
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,440
your phone on your phone right okay I do

727
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,900
that so basically the thing it works the

728
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">same way to you do not have to carry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

729
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,700
information the login<font color="#E5E5E5"> information at</font>

730
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,950
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initiation of login</font>

731
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:42,629
information look at you are code what

732
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:46,078
you can do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> go you can see here's our</font>

733
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:49,079
mobile web page the bank login<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I'm</font>

734
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,510
pressing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue button I get a secure</font>

735
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,310
mean you'll see the pin pad behind it my

736
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,960
fingerprint and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

737
00:36:53,310 --> 00:37:00,779
authenticated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobbying the I logged</font>

738
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:03,480
in already this is on two bars<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cell</font>

739
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,069
connection no Wi-Fi so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

740
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,930
possible to have great user experiences

741
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:12,869
especially as more and more things are

742
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:15,540
moving to mobile but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key is if you</font>

743
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:20,119
want to be more secure just eliminate

744
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,119
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had a question sir</font>

745
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,930
just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

746
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation on like you have to have</font>

747
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:34,740
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> view the the company's website and</font>

748
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:38,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer correct yes the soul of the</font>

749
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,859
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides correct so in this case</font>

750
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,360
secure this case our implementation is

751
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:47,100
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement it on your</font>

752
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,240
website so it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be from two minutes for</font>

753
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:53,790
sam'l<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a Google Apps integration to</font>

754
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,029
maybe a week custom implementation that

755
00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:00,150
you may want to do depends and for the

756
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,800
end users typically our most secure way

757
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,570
would be to download an app that

758
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,040
actually does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device mobile</font>

759
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:11,580
fingerprinting and it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

760
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">really are interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the password</font>

761
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,220
list log in the North excitation attack

762
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,149
to be possible to do this without<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

763
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:24,480
apps we do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS for age cases</font>

764
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:27,360
like I can actually log<font color="#CCCCCC"> into my google</font>

765
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,980
apps account or<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCU account just for</font>

766
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,300
that's a mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no passwords so</font>

767
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,760
anybody is interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy to give</font>

768
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cherie the demo later on but he's</font>

769
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,380
got a safe as mobile device

770
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:42,319
fingerprinting I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so is that</font>

771
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,060
convenient that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

772
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,580
install any apps on the phone yeah

773
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,470
that's pretty good so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

774
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,990
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is your letter your</font>

775
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,879
needs you get to decide how you want to

776
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,879
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes</font>

777
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:13,089
yes theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes we don't have an</font>

778
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,970
implementation for ssh that you could

779
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:20,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not entirely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

780
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:24,368
Windows desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we get to do a lot</font>

781
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,710
of experiments and so one of them was

782
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,660
you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped login for for apps</font>

783
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,720
and stuff it was running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a desktop</font>

784
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:35,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">man so the answer is yes is possible to</font>

785
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:38,379
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again if that's what you</font>

786
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,589
have a need for then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do that</font>

787
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">or you know you could they're only a</font>

788
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:46,210
handful companies giving few companies

789
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:50,020
that do this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US and unfortunately</font>

790
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,400
the reason of the patents<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you</font>

791
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">could actually engage one of those</font>

792
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies to do a custom one for you or</font>

793
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:59,078
for again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about the</font>

794
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,750
marketplace that build one for you but

795
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,240
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of what someone also</font>

796
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,880
recommended well how do we do server to

797
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,040
server validation to that way that's

798
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,579
that's another interesting area but the

799
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,270
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing you</font>

800
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:19,299
take out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this talk is think</font>

801
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:23,170
eliminating passwords that kind of model

802
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:25,720
thinking is 56 years old our environment

803
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:28,510
has completely changed it doesn't serve

804
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,520
us anymore the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why we keep</font>

805
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,910
the password is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what else</font>

806
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,609
to do everything is set up for these are

807
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:39,700
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords so once we change our</font>

808
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:42,400
thinking and start thinking no passwords

809
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:47,078
okay then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually significantly</font>

810
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:50,280
increase security while making it easier

811
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:55,569
for us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right people ok</font>

812
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,809
so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fo needs to be I disproven</font>

813
00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:01,058
since it's not a common<font color="#CCCCCC"> market place</font>

814
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:03,670
phenomena to eliminate passwords but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

815
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:05,290
time goes by I think solutions like this

816
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:09,160
will become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more prevalent</font>

817
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:12,099
because the evilly is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't and it's</font>

818
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our almost 200 accounts do not</font>

819
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:18,190
achieve you can't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique</font>

820
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:22,630
passwords and if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> its algorithmic</font>

821
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:24,700
so you again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep trouble once so you</font>

822
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:28,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">know two or three of them are discovered</font>

823
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,359
so you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a choice bag we've got</font>

824
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,619
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get rid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of passwords right anybody</font>

825
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,400
concur with me on getting rid of

826
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:38,280
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you and the rest dogma</font>

827
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be impressed okay that's not</font>

828
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:45,369
you had a question sir yes by the way we

829
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,200
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> luncheon coming up stopping here</font>

830
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:51,430
for as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we need I'll answer all</font>

831
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,529
the questions in canaria web apps on the

832
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,808
back end that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> required to implement a</font>

833
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:58,240
solution in the server side does it have

834
00:41:55,809 --> 00:42:00,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort of directory services or</font>

835
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">federation like windows or could it be</font>

836
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with other sort of directory</font>

837
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,990
services out there yet you could it's

838
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:11,259
basically a federated identity provider

839
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:14,618
so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to it directly you can</font>

840
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:17,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">go through it through sam'l or we could</font>

841
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">even go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through active directory if you</font>

842
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:25,329
wanted to so they're great questions

843
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,400
we're asking for the thing is well how

844
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:30,880
do we take something like this and fit

845
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,650
it into what we've had right so image of

846
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,359
Engineers you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll always find a</font>

847
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,760
way to fit something it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

848
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:38,680
what we do right but the whole body is

849
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,770
are we thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting rid of</font>

850
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,359
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm right you're</font>

851
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,880
asking that questions if you have more

852
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,308
questions there's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

853
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:52,240
always happy to help out you don't have

854
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:55,390
to use our products you know so I truly

855
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,729
believe in getting rid of passwords if

856
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,440
that's how we're going to be my third

857
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,730
invention that I've done that's probably

858
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,109
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best one out of there</font>

859
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:08,280
then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll probably die with not one</font>

860
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:08,279
yes any other questions yes

861
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:23,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I provider and only point where you keep</font>

862
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,348
all information about

863
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,630
Oh

864
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:36,630
that's that's a great question so uh

865
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,969
first of all what you cannot see in this

866
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:42,180
site is we actually have a verification

867
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:45,359
server and that's private to us it works

868
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:48,118
like DNS if you know and is in a

869
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:52,440
distributed model you know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

870
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,059
have like root DNS a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bnsf verisign for</font>

871
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,940
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about combi means for example</font>

872
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:59,910
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you go there and then it may</font>

873
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:04,380
trickle down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to children DNS s so every</font>

874
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:06,479
DNS is private right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

875
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,109
information is in there some of it could

876
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">be clearly but most normal people are</font>

877
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:14,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">without you know power users with</font>

878
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,279
programmers don't know what's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

879
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:21,059
but he gets you there so it's a similar

880
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:23,549
kind of method<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

881
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:26,519
a version<font color="#CCCCCC"> for health care industry that</font>

882
00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:28,319
doesn't have any PII and no patient

883
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:33,089
information no contact information

884
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:36,329
nothing so and the whole idea was even

885
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:38,160
if we get hacked there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing there</font>

886
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:40,349
to steal it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's encrypted</font>

887
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,969
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's hidden it's not that</font>

888
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:44,219
half of it is here and half of it is

889
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:48,180
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together he just</font>

890
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:50,339
doesn't exist with the HIPAA compliance

891
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,969
you have to sign baa anybody know what

892
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:56,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AA's are those are agreements that</font>

893
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:58,380
you have to sign as a provider for

894
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,420
healthcare organizations and they're

895
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:07,529
getting very very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for vendors</font>

896
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:09,119
because a breach in health care costs

897
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:11,759
three hundred eighty-four dollars per

898
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,880
patient every a regular breach costs

899
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:16,709
only two hundred dollars per user so if

900
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,039
they have a breach and there's a

901
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:21,359
thousand dollar fine per user you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

902
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,719
imagine if you have hundreds of

903
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,328
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of patients how the fines and</font>

904
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:30,680
the cough can escalate<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they try to</font>

905
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:34,410
pass all those costs to the vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

906
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,749
we're recently talking that to a health

907
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:40,739
care insurance provider ly two million

908
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:41,560
patients<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and they say oh you gotta</font>

909
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,080
sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

910
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,500
and if there's any data breach you have

911
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:50,290
a finger in it you got to pay for two

912
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,030
million patients let's round up the cost

913
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:55,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of about four hundred dollars a patient</font>

914
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:58,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talkin 800 million dollar liability</font>

915
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,400
now anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for a company they can</font>

916
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,580
take an eight-hundred-dollar million

917
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,330
liability from one customer and be okay

918
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:09,220
with it we're not that big so our

919
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,009
solution cause let's come up with

920
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,290
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has mill PII no patient</font>

921
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:18,160
information in it yeah we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken</font>

922
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:21,009
into and and we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying there's so</font>

923
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,109
much better CIA can get act if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

924
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,540
get active we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be high not a</font>

925
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:27,700
little we did have a whole design is

926
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,990
based on the fact that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get hack</font>

927
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,379
one day and then going to look at our

928
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:35,500
stuff the question is what can they get

929
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,150
and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

930
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,100
if you don't store any information<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

931
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,350
it can't be still just like the password

932
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

933
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:50,440
be stopped okay any other questions

934
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,150
possible all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

935
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,340
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

936
