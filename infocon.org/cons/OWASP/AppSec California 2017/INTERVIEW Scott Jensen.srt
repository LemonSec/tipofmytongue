you fine thank you Scott you had another

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're on the road a lot</font>

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,650
you talk about a thing called the

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,700
physical web once you help<font color="#E5E5E5"> our audience</font>

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,320
learn a little bit about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if</font>

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,510
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not familiar yet the physical</font>

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">web is a project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the chrome team to</font>

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,800
allow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web to be used in the physical</font>

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,419
world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we basically look for broadcast</font>

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,890
URLs that you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easily on</font>

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,079
your phone so you can kind of walk up

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,430
and use anything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a map to being</font>

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a vending machine for</font>

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,440
example and so I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it one of the</font>

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,700
strategies for your team is to help of

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,470
course along the way make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,880
everything is airtight as possible from

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,620
a security perspective and that was what

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,000
your presentation today was about yeah

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,199
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's all open source</font>

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,120
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do we have our own</font>

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,430
github if you go to physical desk web

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,629
org you can get access to that and it

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,769
was part of why we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

afterwards and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good suggestions as</font>

41
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,899
to how we can fix it so yeah it's really

42
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">worthwhile coming terrific so what do</font>

43
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,929
you think is next for the physical web

44
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:33,210
what should people out there be looking

45
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:34,439
out for well the big thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

46
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,809
doing right now is we're getting it into

47
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,839
chrome and Android both chrome and iOS

48
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,789
and chrome<font color="#E5E5E5"> in physical and on Android</font>

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,799
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrome on iOS but then the next step</font>

50
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:45,719
is to we hope get other people involved

51
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,189
other scanners and so forth and that

52
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,169
will happen as the ecosystem slowly

53
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,119
grows so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that</font>

54
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,639
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> as quickly as we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I had</font>
