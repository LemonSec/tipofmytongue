enhancements<font color="#E5E5E5"> no basic talk just</font>

34
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,509
reviewing the different ways that the

35
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,030
Java language is adding different

36
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,490
security controls at various layers into

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,409
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> language so an update on Java</font>

38
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,059
security Richard great and you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,130
taught a class what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I taught a</font>

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,069
class on secure software two days ago

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,708
right we had about 18 students who

42
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,450
showed up to to hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to build</font>

43
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,060
secure software in a variety of

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have fun classes a</font>

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,649
very mellow class right we had a lot of

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">good conversation I go like one slide</font>

47
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,569
and I get 20 questions so whenever we

48
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,310
have a lot of interaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

49
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,069
always makes me happy I always think

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,160
it's a good value to everyone we had

51
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,500
that interactivity did anyone stump you

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,390
yeah I get stumped once no I encouraged

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,910
him to try to but I've been teaching a

54
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,549
long time so

55
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,410
I was there I get stumped less over time

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,780
but I always get stuck once in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while</font>

57
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,220
we're almost student and a teacher yeah

58
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,810
I took one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim's classes and I</font>

59
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,600
studied up I said I'm going to get them

60
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,730
and I hit you with several questions and

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,799
he answered<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all without hesitation</font>

62
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,590
one time he scratched his beard but but

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about it that's like pulling on</font>

64
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,910
the beard helps the brain blood flow I

65
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,800
think I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying good so you like the</font>

77
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,750
checking the Farmers Almanac and we've

78
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,100
been very lucky so last question for you

79
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,440
Jim<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I know you want to get up to</font>

80
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,500
a session it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start what's</font>

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,840
your envisioned to be the big issues or

82
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,360
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big issues for 2017 you like</font>

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,220
to share so in the information security

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,930
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number one issue</font>

85
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,060
Richard ready let's go right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

86
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,320
one let's not bother with number two or

87
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,000
number three let's get right to number

88
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,390
one how does that sound number number

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,390
one issue is people is hiring and

90
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,029
retaining security professionals because

91
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,769
there's such a limited supply the need

92
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,280
when you see the need for security

93
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:46,340
professionals is exploding and it it

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,530
takes time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the skills and gain</font>

95
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,150
the experience needed to be a serious

96
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,890
security professional there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

97
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,410
enough out there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us years to</font>

98
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,880
catch up in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular area I think</font>

99
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest challenge that</font>

100
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,630
organization space when it comes to

101
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,340
information security excellence and

102
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,890
something that dovetails very nicely

103
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,300
into that is the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> diversity and</font>

104
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,880
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> women into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the field</font>

105
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is extremely important right</font>

106
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,019
when you build a team with a lot of

107
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,390
diverse perspectives and diverse

108
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,418
opinions you get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better problem</font>

109
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,130
solving and innovation and lots of other

110
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:22,070
positive things from working with

111
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,340
