2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,610
the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> California of 2017 and we have</font>

3
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">our second keynote of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day here</font>

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:32,200
closing keynote is chris Roberts chief

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,640
technology architect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Calvillo and like</font>

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,310
to welcome you thank you very much

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,800
appreciative at me here it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful</font>

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,270
location and having just wandered down

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,000
to the beach in back I'm happy I get to

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,309
see the Pacific man so close good so

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,780
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start by telling us</font>

12
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,039
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing you're when you're not</font>

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,780
comprises just talking to people what

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you doing a day job oh my gosh a</font>

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,410
whole bunch of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> aquel dia has got</font>

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,879
me stood in a whole buncha trimmings

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,248
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a calvia were obviously building</font>

18
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,559
the deception technology so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

19
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:04,750
the old idea of honey pots kicking it

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,880
into this century and actually putting a

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,250
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the adaptive predictive work</font>

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,630
behind it so my job inside there is to

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,240
basically do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do act as the bad</font>

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,460
guy and help teach the deception

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,470
technology has to react when I attack it

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">so some fun stuff we'll talk a little</font>

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,979
bit about the keynote doing a bunch of

28
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:23,170
research with them as well which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

29
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:26,140
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun so what do you think the</font>

30
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,990
greatest challenges are and doing that

31
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,759
and adaption technology I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think part of</font>

32
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,710
it is I mean I'm one of the things I'll

33
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,630
be assassinating later on is ID user

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,158
behavior analytics and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">generation of stuff which is like guys</font>

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,899
you slapped next year's blinky light on

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,669
this year's equipment and you've got

38
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good marketing so what the heck</font>

39
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,149
else you doing here it hasn't worked for

40
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,500
20 years what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do</font>

41
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,210
differently you know how do we actually

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,189
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop relying on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the static</font>

43
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,960
equipment that we have and part start

44
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,479
burning stuff inside that actually looks

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,399
at the environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tin adapts more</font>

46
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,259
effectively to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment is in and</font>

47
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,549
she helps us<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than giving us more</font>

48
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,289
bloody screens to watch and everything

49
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">else that actually helps us do what we</font>

50
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:09,130
need to do and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> educate the</font>

51
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:11,350
people in the security industry that was

52
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,030
a challenge that one's<font color="#E5E5E5"> downs a challenge</font>

53
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,489
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just continually doing the</font>

54
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,440
messaging and put in the research out I

55
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,940
mean the the research i'll be talking a

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit about it today which is we</font>

57
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,390
start breaking down into nano

58
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,800
architecture so inside the human

59
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,290
so no longer do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the human by</font>

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,090
social engineering them we hacked them

61
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,350
by directing our of<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling at them</font>

62
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,660
and messing around with nanotube

63
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,850
architectures inside them so if we

64
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,560
haven't got our security<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed now and</font>

65
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't figured out how to actually</font>

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
take it beyond the stage it was that 20

67
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago which we really haven't I got</font>

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,410
issues that in 10-15 years time we'll

69
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,030
have architecture inside of us that we

70
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,859
still have less control over than we do

71
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,300
today especially with the platter of IOT

72
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,630
devices and everything else is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,970
sir in some challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what made</font>

74
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,090
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> California would be</font>

75
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,680
a good venue to come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to people</font>

76
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,510
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a different audience I mean</font>

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things i read on</font>

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,290
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our industry intersect guys</font>

79
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,260
typically speak to other information

80
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,880
security professionals so it were

81
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to ourselves so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

82
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,900
better audience are coming at two<font color="#CCCCCC"> ab sec</font>

83
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,579
where you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of like a lot of</font>

84
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the younger generation going see how the</font>

85
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,010
20 35 year old guys they try to help

86
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,690
cool each other getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation</font>

87
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,820
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> emma going hey when you look at</font>

88
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,680
building it don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a point</font>

89
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,120
solution don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> build something</font>

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,769
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve one little bit of</font>

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,019
a problem in one little<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing start</font>

92
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,459
looking broader start throwing the

93
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,920
crystal ball five years down the line

94
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,320
ten years down the line how can I

95
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,238
develop something now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will help me</font>

96
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,430
and help others five or ten years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

97
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,140
future and what can i do to broaden it

98
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,230
so it's not just focus on enterprise so

99
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,279
it looks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the distributed data</font>

100
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,350
so it's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that word out to</font>

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,030
you know the app set professional guys

102
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,500
and it's a hell of a community you guys

103
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,820
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like here is really really cool so</font>

104
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,380
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the word to them and then</font>

105
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,690
they'll spread it to their teams and off

106
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,010
we go from there great well<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to have</font>
