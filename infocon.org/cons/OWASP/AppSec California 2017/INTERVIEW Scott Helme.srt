to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> events they're always</font>

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,020
really good crowds really nice kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,000
community feels so a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long trip</font>

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,550
like you say but it's definitely worth

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,230
it great so you're one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our four</font>

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,160
trainers this year at the event tell us

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,500
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about the training you</font>

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,629
offered so the cosine delivering is the

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,040
best TLS training in the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,750
slightly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> basis title for the course</font>

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,940
but we've worked harder and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly</font>

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,040
believe that it is and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,349
how to deploy TLS from start to finish

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,570
on a floss I'm the ssl loves test at the

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,798
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it yeah a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people love that</font>

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,149
tool because it's an easy way to

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,380
communicate upwards and downwards and

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,530
the security organization you know

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,460
fitness for purpose right so post about

32
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,560
the experience of the class that

33
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,240
everybody give good feedback or what was

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,340
the experience for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as a trainer yeah</font>

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,380
it's really good I mean you know we had

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,729
we have quite small classes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 here I</font>

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,920
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this time we usually kept it</font>

38
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,030
kind of around 16 and so we can have

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so long time with</font>

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,720
people if they need help it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite an</font>

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,950
intensive course and but you know it's

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,210
hard work but everybody really enjoys<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

43
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,070
because they take a long way afterwards

44
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,140
they go from from nothing to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus on</font>

45
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,820
SSL last which is kind of the industry

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">standard is the best that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do so</font>

47
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,729
to go from nothing to that in a day

48
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,890
people are usually pretty happy with

49
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sounds great so tell us a little</font>

50
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,180
bit about the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you like</font>

51
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,890
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps at California so far I have</font>

52
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,960
to say is the weather like normally I go

53
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,970
to conferences in England and then not

54
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,229
this nice but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's a really good</font>

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,658
crowd here you know I don't know many

56
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,100
people over<font color="#E5E5E5"> this side of the pond but</font>

61
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,350
really hard because I literally can't

62
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,908
decide where I want to be because

63
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,700
