talking about looking at web application

13
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,769
attack surface doing some more

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,269
calculating you know what are the URLs

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,890
and application exposes what are the

16
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:48,980
parameters that application will respond

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,829
to and manipulating<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and watching</font>

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,839
how that changes over time and we're

more thorough testing but also

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,530
especially looking at how it changes

24
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:05,750
over time how you can use that to focus

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,909
testing activities to say I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>
