00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,989
originally a maybe three or four years

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,148
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago here so it's great to have you back</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at github security these</font>

10
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:34,660
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present tell</font>

11
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,029
the audience if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't mind a little</font>

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,739
bit about your presentation my

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation really just focuses on the</font>

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,730
fact that securing a start-up is

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,640
fundamentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> different in securing say</font>

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,769
the enterprise really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,289
focus on is prevention rather than

18
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:51,699
finding bugs or fixing bugs because

19
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,160
that's the only way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can scale a</font>

20
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,960
small team as a company grows which way

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,910
it will grow faster than<font color="#E5E5E5"> your security</font>

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,800
team so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very specific</font>

23
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,748
technologies that you can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font>

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,839
early on there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of specific</font>

25
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:08,020
cultural things that you can emphasize

26
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,240
as people do their day-to-day work and

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,820
really you just shouldn't be doing

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,190
anything unless it can scale and so my

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,139
focus where my talk was about everything

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,460
I've learned over the past five years or

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,380
so working with two startups

32
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,899
specifically github and Twitter and

33
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,240
literally what worked and what didn't

34
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:27,070
work I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with any</font>

35
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,780
sort of comprehensive high level plan

36
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,789
that will work for everyone it was

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,090
specifically based on facts of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

38
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened in the past right so you've</font>

39
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,560
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of change in your startup</font>

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,299
experience as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as here at ups at</font>

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,570
California so have you seen this

42
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:45,070
conference change over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

43
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">well the first year was definitely a</font>

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,758
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> rough attendance was a little</font>

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,439
light and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there are fewer</font>

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,170
conversations happening just because

47
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,240
there were less people but now I see a

48
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,549
good mix of all the familiar faces lots

49
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,048
of new faces certainly a more diverse

50
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,479
crowd which i think is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

51
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,000
important part and because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

52
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">think more conversations are happening</font>

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,899
what do you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more diverse what</font>

54
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,660
wait well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a bunch of white</font>

55
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:13,630
dudes anymore certainly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do more</font>

56
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,220
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that regard but the the amount of</font>

57
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,230
women here the amount of people of color

58
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,650
has significantly grown from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

59
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,420
year terrific<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I know you always</font>

60
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,550
have a lot of projects a lot of things

61
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on I understand you're working on</font>

62
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,300
a conference a new

63
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,170
conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> he tell us a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font>

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,030
that sure when we first decided to do

65
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,670
apps at California we didn't really have

66
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,670
a coherent mission on what we all wanted

67
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,559
it to be and sort of the the interests

68
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,320
of the two groups might have split at

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,440
some point so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind this</font>

70
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,690
conference is to make it a single track

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,070
invite<font color="#CCCCCC"> only so no CFP I'm sorry anyone</font>

72
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,140
can attend what the speakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

73
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,010
invite only so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a very very</font>

74
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,640
highly curated content sort of thing

75
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,709
unfortunately that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that a lot of</font>

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a chance to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

77
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">their feet wet and we understand that</font>

78
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,930
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem for a lot of people</font>

79
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's it's something that conferences</font>

80
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,350
like this definitely give people a

81
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,360
chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but we wanted to get a</font>

82
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,760
small number of people together who

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,830
really have a great chance of making

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,090
great changes for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as a</font>

85
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,740
whole in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of time what</font>

86
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,090
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be you have a way</font>

87
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,130
people can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more and then I have</font>

88
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,140

definitely talks that are beginner

121
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,270
friendly and there are talks that are

122
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,510
highly technical and perhaps very

123
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,130
high level but nobody's better than
