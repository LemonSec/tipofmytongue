so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find in the software</font>

2
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,840
security marketplace and the software

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,000
security community is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font>

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,939
knows everybody it's a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,769
world still there<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font>

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,830
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the planet doing this stuff</font>

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,780
and doing favors for each other even in

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,809
different parts of the communities super

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,640
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what OS is doing to</font>

10
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,099
get the word out about software security

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,970
is pretty fundamental to helping it grow

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and scale and so sharing my ideas with</font>

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,920
people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> California that are thinking</font>

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">about application security and software</font>

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,230
security and getting those people to

16
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:02,050
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> scalability about real-world</font>

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,229
problems about talking to boards of

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,420
directors about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you measure software</font>

19
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,630
security and making things kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,460
slightly more strategic is an important

part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

22
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,039
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've learned over the last 21</font>

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,040
years

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,360
that's a really good question I actually

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's an important phenomenon you</font>

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,180
got to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:33,160
on computer security in 1995 with the

28
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,500
advent of Java and because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,789
grant from DARPA to work on it at

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,070
digital I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security guy I had</font>

31
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">just finished a PhD in cognitive science</font>

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,899
in computer science with Doug<font color="#CCCCCC"> hofstetter</font>

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,390
so I knew an awful lot about machine

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,820
learning and I knew a lot about AI and I

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,130
knew a lot about computer science but I

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,500
had to learn about security one of the

37
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that helped us all back then was</font>

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had people from many different</font>

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,660
backgrounds coming together to address

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,800
the security problem in a new way so if

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:12,190
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about say Dan here who has a</font>

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,840
PhD in biostatistics or you know there

43
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">are lots of different people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,700
mention like this or you know Marcus

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">raynham whose background was in the</font>

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,989
military and then working at Sur but

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,239
these people come came from very diverse

48
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:29,320
backgrounds and that led to the security

49
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:32,130
renaissance in 1995-96 all the way up

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,690
through 2000 we made a huge difference

51
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,209
lately in getting the message of

52
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,050
building security in into the world

53
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,150
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is super</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good but what we need now</font>

54
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,760
is different perspectives so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give</font>

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:50,650
you an example security testing as a

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,750
discipline needs work we do okay with

57
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,150
pen testing we can break some stuff we

58
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,580
can find some bugs but if you ask the

59
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,430
typical security tester what's code

60
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,280
coverage they don't know everybody in QA

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,989
knows that so if QA people start coming

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,299
to this conference and learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

63
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,130
security they can also teach us about

64
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,510
testing and that goes through every

65
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,510
sub-discipline you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size right now is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font>

67
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,670
because what I've experienced so far is

68
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,920
an enthusiastic and large enough

69
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,730
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people that can do this for</font>

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">a living are willing to come and talk to</font>

72
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that many people that's good but more</font>

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,819
importantly there's still the energy of

74
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,829
the hall track there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

75
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,750
run into people who haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen for a</font>

76
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,930
while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you can catch up</font>

77
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,150
with and there's plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of scheduling</font>

78
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,980
allowed for networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the hall</font>

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,230
track is pretty strong from what I've

80
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,000
experienced in the last couple hours so

81
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:58,799
I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part of the conference stays</font>

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,040
the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is software security seems</font>

83
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,170
like it's made great progress especially

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,069
in the last 21 years since<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote</font>

85
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,079
building secure software<font color="#CCCCCC"> Everts viega in</font>

86
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:13,018
1999 but we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have plenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to</font>

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,690
go and what's happened is we have gotten

88
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">the early adopters have been doing a</font>

89
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,320
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> job with software security and now</font>

90
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,108
the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> markets beginning to pick it</font>

91
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,229
up the good news is we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do</font>

92
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,240
we know what should be done and we in

93
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,580
some sense now need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take those</font>

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages wide and get all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

95
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,359
developers out there in the world to do

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff so what I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the besom</font>

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,000
targets we had about 300,000 developers

98
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,400
278,000 some developers that are

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,310
directly touched by the reason but there

100
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">are 8 million developers out there so we</font>

101
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,729
have our work cut out for us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

102
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,160
software security world the good news is

103
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,110
we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do we know why to do it</font>

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,440
we know how to measure it now it's time

105
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,440
to do it

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,340
you
