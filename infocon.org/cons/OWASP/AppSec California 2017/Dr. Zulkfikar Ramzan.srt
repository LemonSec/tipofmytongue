1
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,299
now part of why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to talk about</font>

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,650
machine learning to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the following</font>

3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically when you hear about machine</font>

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,560
learning you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it from one a</font>

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,900
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> places you hear about it from</font>

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,220
vendors and you look at the vendor

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">whitepapers they claimed that machine</font>

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,479
learning can solve world peace they can

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,650
cure<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancer they can help with space</font>

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,230
exploration and whole bunch of other

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,089
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably can't quite do on</font>

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,120
the flip side if you learn about machine

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,680
learning from academic papers you'll get

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe a more balanced view but typically</font>

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,540
that view is restricted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened</font>

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside of a very nice clean lab</font>

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,940
environment it doesn't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what's</font>

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen if you try to take those</font>

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,949
same ideas and apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

20
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,199
so my goal was to prod a bit of a

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,289
balanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> view now I call the talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

22
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">security ruler boondoggle this is what</font>

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when technical folks spend too</font>

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,329
much time with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing team</font>

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,710
hopefully the title makes some sense but

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,030
the idea to provide a more balanced view

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,710
the goods are bad and the ugly of

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,180
machine learning so if you are thinking

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about using machine learning whether</font>

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,360
you're trying to implement it yourself

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,580
or you're evaluating a third party

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendor solution or capability the hope</font>

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you some additional context</font>

34
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,830
help you make an intelligent decision

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,600
about exactly what machine learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide you with and whether or not it's</font>

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,039
something that you actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

38
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">within your own products and services so</font>

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
with that let's get started I'll bring

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,890
the talk into three parts so I'll start

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,420
off by giving you a broad stroke

42
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,520
overview of machine learning this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for</font>

43
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,460
me to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone on the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> page look</font>

44
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,350
at it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minute crash course in</font>

45
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,039
various aspects of machine learning

46
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,449
designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just enough</font>

47
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so you can understand the</font>

48
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,110
rest of the presentation the second

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I'll do is I'll talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

50
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,789
machine learning can be applied within

51
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,990
cyber security now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be that</font>

52
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,750
complicated once you understand what

53
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,158
machine learning can do then the third

54
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,140
part which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really raw spend the bulk</font>

55
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,670
of my time is talking about best

56
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,469
practices and pitfalls and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

57
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,329
go hand in hand if you find a pitfall in

58
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,100
the implementation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> typically</font>

59
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,110
suggests the corresponding best practice

60
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,158
well maybe what I call a better practice

61
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,110
because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to define</font>

62
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,729
sometimes what best means is it's a

63
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,568
constantly evolving area

64
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,680
and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's go ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

65
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,230
started and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about machine learning</font>

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,599
with the more detail now machine

67
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,399
learning according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to arthur Samuelson</font>

68
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,709
was an early pioneer in artificial

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,150
intelligence is a few of the study<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

70
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,720
gets computers the ability to learn

71
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,220
without being explicitly programmed now

72
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most remarkable thing about</font>

73
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,109
that definition is it was proposed in

74
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,489
1959 so machine learning with the field

75
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,530
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for more than half a</font>

76
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,030
century even though it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like it's</font>

77
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,500
gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> very popular in the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

78
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,120
of years especially as you start to look

79
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,010
at what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the vendor</font>

80
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">community and beyond but the field</font>

81
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,239
itself is very rich<font color="#E5E5E5"> and has a broad</font>

82
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,470
history more concretely in technical

83
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,900
terms but it involves developing

84
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,900
algorithms that can draw inferences from

85
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,280
and make predictions<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on data so</font>

86
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,780
the key word here is data it's really

87
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,390
about being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the right data</font>

88
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,560
sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> development it needs to extract</font>

89
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,540
insights from of data sources

90
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,129
automatically then apply those insights

91
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,060
to move instances that you haven't

92
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,170
really encountered before machine

93
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,400
learning itself inside a rich history

94
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,010
it's evolved from other areas of

95
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer science so things like</font>

recognition data science from so on and

98
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,959
so forth and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we've seen subtle</font>

99
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,030
differences in terminology and

100
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,919
nomenclature but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

101
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,139
ideas are now becoming much more

102
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,489
mainstream and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> goals now for the</font>

103
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,660
practitioners how do you actually take

104
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,489
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas from the lab</font>

105
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,200
environment and make them growth in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,299
life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus a bit on</font>

107
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that now the reason people like machine</font>

108
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,599
learning the reason it's been in a lot

109
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,239
of popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention is it enables you</font>

110
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,500
to get some degree of automation because

111
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually plan to learn</font>

112
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,310
automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> from data but you're</font>

113
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,599
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in theory should be unbiased</font>

114
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,250
because it's based directly on the data

115
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,810
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking at you're not</font>

116
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,150
introducing any human bias listen to

117
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,859
what the actual outcome is going to be

118
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,359
and I finally there's an element where

119
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,980
you can try to improve over time so as

120
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,780
you get new data coming into a system

121
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,828
the hope is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use machine</font>

122
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,799
learning techniques to evolve

123
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,359
automatically based on you data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

124
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,000
obviously very relevant in a security

125
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,530
context so for security specifically

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,810
machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning is interesting because</font>

127
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,579
it enables some level of automation so

128
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,079
can we come up with models automatically

129
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,299
for being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify malicious</font>

130
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">activity and more importantly can we</font>

131
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,959
enable those models to evolve over time

132
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,969
as you get new data about attack

133
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,590
behavior because too

134
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,110
we're not dealing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical</font>

135
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,369
static adversary in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security we</font>

136
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,990
deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a century an adversary who's</font>

137
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,810
going to try to modify what they do on a

138
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,370
regular basis that's the theory and

139
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">practice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a lot more</font>

140
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,190
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some of the stuff work</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going to be the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">learning in general involves three parts</font>

145
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,669
I'm labeling these things explicitly

146
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,200
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it helps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us understand</font>

some of the pitfalls and best practices

148
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,900
so the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of beat a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">machine learning in general you'll see</font>

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,919
exactly how I'm thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

153

how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start to apply it or where</font>

154

you can avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the mistakes that</font>

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,990
I've seen happen in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past typically</font>

156
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,300
there are three phases machine learning

157
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you start off with data very important</font>

158
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,080
to kind of call this out from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that date</font>

159
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the goal is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generate a model and</font>

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that model is something that's going to</font>

161
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,080
basically be<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's more</font>

162
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,030
compact and easy representation that's

163
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,609
adequately or well explained by the data

164
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea can we take that model and</font>

apply to these instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we draw</font>

166
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,150
inferences can be existing data and use

167
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,820
that to reason about things we haven't

168
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,500
seen before now in fact the way it works

169
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,390
is your model typically has a set of

170
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,800
parameters so you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe the</font>

171
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,840
model instead of equations and there's

172
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,250
some unknown and the goal of the machine

173
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,750
learning algorithm typically to figure

174
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,479
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the values for those unknowns that</font>

175
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,640
optimize the behavior of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> model with</font>

176
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,140
respect to the data we started with with

177
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hope being a particular correctly</font>

178
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,460
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to then apply that model</font>

179
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,840
to you instances and so it becomes an

180
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,460
optimization problem can I fill in those

181
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,640
question marks with actual parameter

182
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,260

work its way backwards to find out what

where a human team of Grand<font color="#CCCCCC"> Master's</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer was just used to leverage</font>

that typically involves a human expert

00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might want to look at the size of</font>

whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the loan should be given</font>

316
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,939
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody's worked for</font>

many many years they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

candidate if they're married and maybe a

322
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,540

those points have some kind of structure

into three different clusters and that

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,279
kind of tells you something about the

the attributes of those other points

364

could then be transferred potentially to

that you point that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

a sudden we're seeing a situation where

<font color="#CCCCCC">that what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the challenges</font>

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,880
practices for machine learning this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

486
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,890
really where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,180
interesting part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk is the rest</font>

488
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,949
of the work was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

489
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,839
that I was audio or

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay perfect the rest of the talk was</font>

491
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,110
really about giving you some of the

492
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,520
foundations this happens going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

493
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,170
really about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to understand</font>

494
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,030
how to apply those foundations correctly

495
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,530
and what I see is some of the challenges

496
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,880
and being able to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,060

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work in real life I've been</font>

501
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,599
by the way so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by way of background</font>

502
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,100
I've had a chance to work on machine

503
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,380
learning now at a four or five different

504
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies that kind of lose track but it</font>

505
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,689
started off at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Symantec a number of</font>

506
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago and I see a whole wall with</font>

507
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,500
yellow so it's kind of good to see some

508
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,390
old colleagues but for the cool thing

509
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,860
there is that you know over time we kind

510
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,060
of learned the hard way what would and

511
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,260
wouldn't work when you all of a sudden

512
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,089
take something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks really great</font>

513
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,250
on paper and produces a really beautiful

514
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,560
graph and you try to put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 200</font>

515
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">million users and you don't want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

516
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,479
that wrong on day one so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

517
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,569
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a really subtle point</font>

518
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,800
is that it has to start with good data

519
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,060
it's amazing how many people forget this

520
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,740
right that's why I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked about</font>

521
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,660
the process of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> data then features</font>

522
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,310
and classifier because if you don't

523
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with good data nothing else</font>

524
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,869
matters machine learning is garbage in

525
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,810
garbage out I've seen many cases where

526
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,040
people will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a training set</font>

527
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,900
they'll develop a model based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

528
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,270
training set then they'll try to apply

529
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,439
that model on<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data that looks</font>

nothing that training set that they

531
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally trained on and sometimes it's</font>

532
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">very subtle I mean it may be like in</font>

533
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,670
they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have at the best of intentions</font>

534
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,589
but they may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using like a</font>

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,729
black<font color="#CCCCCC"> box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool or an existing machine</font>

536
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,840
learning library they weren't paying

537
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,940
attention to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was happening inside</font>

538
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,020
the library and sometimes a libraries

539
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,180
are manipulating some of the training

540
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,189
data as part of training and you may end

541
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">up getting a different results and I've</font>

542
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,310
seen this gotten catastrophic me wrong

543
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,390
in so many cases that it's I'm just

544
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,540
pointing it out even though it almost

545
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,650
seems somewhat obvious ultimately with

546
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,849
machine learning you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">last questions just like you wouldn't</font>

548
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,020
data science it's not about looking at

549
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,040
data and making inferences typically

550
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,150
there's a phase in which you look at

551
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,069
that data and you say what are the right

552
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,420
questions to ask what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the right</font>

553
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,339
things to look at and then based on that

554
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with intelligent inferences</font>

555
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,339
so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of machine learning is</font>

556
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,170
a panacea if it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> really beautiful</font>

557
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,820
on paper you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> still got to be very</font>

558
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,860
careful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you put it</font>

559
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,110

560
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,280
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier and that I think is one of</font>

561
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">the grandest challenges with machine</font>

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge is people get obsessed</font>

564
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,220
with the classifier I mean I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

565
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,989
seen you put an engineer in front of a

566
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,690
good library<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll start tweaking</font>

567
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,830
every single aspect of the classifier

568
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,780
but to me that's the least important

569
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of machine learning if you're</font>

latest techniques that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

574
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,879
that's all fine and good but again has

575
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start with data first then coming up</font>

576
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,690
with the right features associated with

577
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that data set and then and only then do</font>

578
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,140
you care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classifier now it</font>

579
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out that if you've got the right</font>

580
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,800

581
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,780
a secret it almost doesn't matter what

582
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,950
classifier you choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all perform</font>

583
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,080
within like a fraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a percent of</font>

584
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,270
each other and most academics<font color="#CCCCCC"> who focus</font>

585
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this topic if they're looking for</font>

586
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,000
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-tenth of one percent</font>

587
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,149
improvement or maybe like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one percent</font>

588
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,680
improvement to publish a paper in

589
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,450
practice there may be reasons to go with

590
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,650
a simpler classifier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> debugging or</font>

591
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,660
being able to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the field</font>

592
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,190
and really focusing on make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure your</font>

593
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,380
data is good and your features are good

594
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,970
so I see that mistake over and over

595
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,730
again you'll hire a cadre of you know

596
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,080
PhDs in machine learning and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

597
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,220
have one domain expert on their team to

598
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,020
say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the features that are most</font>

599
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,250
relevant like here's a good example

600
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,389
let's say you're trying to develop a

601
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,330
machine learning system to try to

602
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,420
classify whether or not a given URL is

603
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,800
likely to be malicious okay if you do

604
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">also decreasing the URL you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

manipulate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten ways till Sunday but</font>

606
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you ask any analyst in a security</font>

607
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,870
operations and what the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do</font>

608
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,100
when they see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a URL they do a whois</font>

609
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,500
lookup and they figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how long that</font>

610
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,850
domain name isn't around that's probably

611
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strongest indicators of</font>

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,680
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not looking for that if</font>

617
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,250
simple features that gives you a huge

618
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,020
performance boost and that's why it's

619
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really critical to focus on those three</font>

620
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">layers in order start what good data</font>

621
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,920
then focus on features and then worry

622
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">about your classifier and I'm really</font>

623
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,830
laboring this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the stack the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that</font>

629
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,669
security has what I call a class

630
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">imbalance problem most things we see in</font>

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,760
real life are not malicious most times

632
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,220
their credit card transactions made its

633
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,920
benign most files on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop are not</font>

634
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,299
malware and this almost seems obvious

635
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,440
but it actually has a

636
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,149
huge implication for machine learning

637
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,730
systems because machine learning systems

638
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:02,649
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidestep all those legitimate</font>

639
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,320
instances on their way to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

640
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:07,090
illegitimate instance which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

641
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,950
the problem of false positives is huge

642
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,269
it is a tremendous I think it's the

643
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,610
number one thing if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to focus</font>

644
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,019
on minimizing in an infield setting is

645
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,059
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you minimize that false positive</font>

646
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,489
rate how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the</font>

647
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,200
right metrics that matter and it turns

648
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:21,639
out that class and balance becomes a

649
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,379
really critical measure because if you

650
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,459
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about class and balance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

651
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,928
odds are that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not going to be</font>

652
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,340
able to interpret your metrics correctly

653
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:30,220
and know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you're</font>

654
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:33,399
performing well so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font>

655
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those metrics typically in machine</font>

656
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,299
learning there are two very high level

657
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,669
metrics that are applied<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cyber</font>

658
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,918
security the one metric is what i call

659
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:43,179
the crew positive or<font color="#E5E5E5"> detection rate this</font>

660
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rate at which we detect malicious</font>

661
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,230
stuff so for example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have your</font>

662
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,009
data set that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate</font>

663
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,109
you look at all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

664
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,299
malicious met data set and you try to

665
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:54,009
find what percentage of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

666
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,168
malicious things were classified as

667
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious by your machine learning</font>

668
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,239
algorithm that's a detection rate on the

669
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,799
flip side there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> false positive rate</font>

670
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,539
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the rate at which you might</font>

671
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,590
alarm accidentally how many times are

672
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,749
you taking something that's otherwise

673
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,470
legitimate and calling it bad

674
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:12,609
accidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mention these two metrics</font>

675
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,690
together because you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

676
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:15,639
them in conjunction with each other a

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,840
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will tout incredible true</font>

678
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,799
positive rate so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

679
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,199
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred percent</font>

680
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:21,309
detection rate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll never tell</font>

681
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,090
you what the false positive rate is

682
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:23,440
you've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that together</font>

683
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,539
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I can build a</font>

684
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,580
fantastic classifier with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

685
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,408
percent detection rate all I'll say is

686
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,539
everything is bad that's got a hundred

687
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent detection rate it's also got a</font>

688
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:35,859
really crappy false positive rate now I

689
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,230
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sounds almost like brain-dead</font>

690
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,970
but at some level if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a step</font>

691
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,320
back you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of vendors never</font>

692
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about the other aspect of their</font>

693
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,908
metric and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes it may be very</font>

694
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,200
very bad especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you couple that</font>

695
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,940
with class and balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll give an</font>

696
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,119
example of that in a moment to make that

697
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,440
point really really crystal clear and so

698
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,850
in general there's a trade-off between

699
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,739
the true positive rate and the false

700
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,139
positive rate as you get more aggressive

701
00:21:56,739 --> 00:22:01,389
to detect things they're more likely to

702
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:02,979
get false positives so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

703
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:04,449
typically trying to measure isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

704
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,279
true positive rate and false positive

705
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,720
rate on<font color="#CCCCCC"> its own where you're trying to</font>

706
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,070
understand what machine learning is a

707
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,019
trade-off that you get between them

708
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,340
a good machine learning algorithm will

709
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,470
give you a favorable trade off it will

710
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you a big bump potentially in the</font>

711
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,070
true positive rate for a modest or maybe

712
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,230
small increase in the false positive

713
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,789
rate and the way we do that in practice

714
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,080
is we try to take the true positive and

715
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:25,269
false positive rates that we get from

716
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,539
our classifiers we could pick we graph

717
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:29,440
them we call that graph the ROC curve

718
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:31,389
the receiver operating characteristic

719
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,179
curve and we try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

720
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:36,428
under that curve as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a measure of how</font>

721
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,929
well that classifier is giving you a

722
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,690
trade-off between true positives and

723
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:42,129
false positives and that's very a better

724
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,419
metric to look at verses just an

725
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,620
individual through positive a false

726
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:46,059
positive rate because it could totally

727
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,879
depend on the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned with so now let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at a</font>

729
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:53,860
more detailed example about why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

730
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,179
false positives don't tell the whole

731
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,100
story why you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

732
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,450
everything together suppose you're

733
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,949
reading an academic paper and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

734
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,120
academic papers that say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

735
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">this they go you know we develop a</font>

736
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,360
system with one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

737
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:07,360
detection rate one hundred percent true

738
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,758
positive rate and a 0.1 percent false

739
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,750
positive rate that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good</font>

740
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,250
right those numbers sound pretty

741
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,480
compelling if I saw a paper like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

742
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,429
didn't know any better I might say well

743
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,809
yeah that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something I should</font>

744
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,370
implement and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never seen</font>

745
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,139
a paper with these good numbers so keep

746
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,489
in mind this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much a</font>

747
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:25,120
dream scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of academic</font>

749
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,678
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> life so imagine I've got a bunch of</font>

750

instances if you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yellow and</font>

751
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,529
there's one malicious one in there

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,470
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's really really bad</font>

753
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:36,610
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are otherwise benign</font>

754
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,990
very typical scenario if you're looking

755
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,360
at credit card transactions most are

756
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,700

758

files on a laptop there might be one

764
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,830
it kind of works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this example to</font>

imagine for<font color="#E5E5E5"> every 10,000</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you see</font>

amazing classifier to this scenario if I

769
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,039
did then let's say out of all these ten

thousand transactions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cal catch the</font>

legitimate the illegitimate one because

I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> assisted with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

of an incident response center or a sock

780
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:32,289
or you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at alerts or whatever</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you're going to get another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 alerts you see only one was</font>

time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're spent chasing false leads the</font>

787
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,070
reason I'm really believer in this point

788
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,479
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you think about it for a</font>

789
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,620
moment the numbers i started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

790
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,690
one hundred percent and point one

791
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,239
percent those<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers sound really</font>

792
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,950
fantastic at a high level when you work

793
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means in practice it turns</font>

00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,950
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really dangerous it turns out</font>

795
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually probably</font>

796
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,399
is untenable if i told you i'm going to

<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you a technology where you going to</font>

room in about five seconds right there

801
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,260
would be no hope of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font>

802
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,000
that done and yet it's really about

803
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,158
phrasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started out by talking about</font>

804
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">metrics in a very positive light when</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you work out with his metrics mean in</font>

806
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,750
practice it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

807
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:25,629
negative if you're not careful about how

808
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:26,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply them so the moral of the story</font>

809
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,809
is think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your metrics really</font>

810
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,390
really carefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> i give you just one</font>

811
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:33,820
example and there are many others for

812
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,309
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> not every false positive is</font>

813
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,970
created equal if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had a false positive</font>

814
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:41,970
on a popular file let's say svchost.exe

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">now that has ever happened in real life</font>

816
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,630
some of you know that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

817
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,130
worse than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a false positive on a file</font>

818
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,779
that has never appeared anywhere maybe

819
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,179
on one system out there in the world if

820
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:54,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">i had a false positive on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

business application in organization

maybe not be a very popular file but if

823
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,059
it goes takes one system down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:11,289
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that not every true</font>

that to what it means for an

organization you've got to account for

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,299
some of these factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of what</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">thing this is kind of funny</font>

842
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,070
maliciousness is subjective you know I

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,790
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to customers where they don't mind</font>

toolbar I don't know why they don't mind

846
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,730
it but somehow they don't mind it maybe

847
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,110
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a dword maybe they want</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not always a clear-cut answer</font>

851
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,680
and it totally depends on the scenario

and you can play think of other

scenarios that are more pernicious and

854
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,370
then finally machine learning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

855
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,510
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an isolation a lot of</font>

856
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,060
vendors talk about it like it's the

857
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,160
be-all end-all typically when machine

858
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,750
learning is used in a system it's one

859
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,710
part of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of different techniques</font>

860
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,970
that are used to find malicious behavior

861
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,170
so if you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluate whether</font>

862
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,000
or not a machine learning system is

<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have so typically</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll have some black list and some</font>

white list which we know aren't perfect

868
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,920
but they do a pretty good job of all the

869
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,360
popular stuff and then what's left<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

870
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,790
might be looked at by machine learning

system or by some other technique so the

872
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,420
real criteria is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not how do you do on</font>

how do you do on a data set that remains

one some of the other techniques have

876

877
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,480
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> additive value and there</font>

878
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,710
may be cases where you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

learning system with a ten percent

detection rate which sounds awful but if

881
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,430
it detects a ten percent of things that

882
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,350

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,840
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things in context and by the way</font>

885
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,699
the opposite is true as well you may

<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tension system a machine learning</font>

what happens if you're trying to develop

to make a small change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">might try to design a machine learning</font>

15<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 15 board and then they'll try to</font>

960
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,770
see what happens is they take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

961
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,169
system and make it work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a larger</font>

962
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,280
board that's something humans are pretty

963
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:24,110
good at we're pretty good at being able

964
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,928
to adapt to slightly different scenarios

965
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,570
with limited data but machines are not

966
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,250
good at doing that and to this day the

967

literature<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of inductive</font>

learning and transfer learning we've

969
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,110
shown some early promise but I think

970
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,480
there's a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go before we can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">make this stuff work in real life but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pitfalls specific to it so for example</font>

the training set<font color="#E5E5E5"> in supervised learning</font>

976
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,120
will typically capture what you know

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,459
about right it's all the stuff that

978
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of in the past which means</font>

the models that you generate from that

980
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,010
training set might draw some additional

981
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,039
instances but will relieve slightly

982
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,559
expand your state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of knowledge and</font>

983
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:08,059
often happens is people develop these

really cool looking models and once they

end up with at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day is</font>

986
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:12,649
kind of a glorified signature it's

<font color="#CCCCCC">yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about which is really what</font>

996
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:30,289
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to apply but she and</font>

997
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,210
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first place so again it</font>

998
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,929
may give you some mileage but may not be

999
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:37,460
as much as you think on the flip side

1000
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:39,669
again Moses behavior subjective and

1001
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,399
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something is malicious is</font>

1002
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:44,659
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what that tool is and more</font>

1003
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:47,238
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it's being used what the</font>

1004
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:48,619
intent is so for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> power show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1005
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,749
know we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> powershell powershell as</font>

1006
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:53,178
good uses we see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bad guys use</font>

1007
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:54,470
powershell as well you can't develop a

1008
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:56,450
machine learning algorithm the classic

1009
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,769
classifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> powershell on its own which</font>

1010
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,840
you've got to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at maybe is how it's</font>

1011
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,479
being used and whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that used</font>

1012
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,439
is actually malicious and intent and

1013
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:06,559
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really hard to</font>

1014
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,999
do there may be cases where somebody is

1015
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,399
legitimately allowed to transfer a lot

1016
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:11,869
of data out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your data center they're</font>

1017
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,209
allowed to they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for specific</font>

1018
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:16,279
business purpose the intention is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1019
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,049
but you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else in there who</font>

1020
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:19,399
maybe has a bad intention and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

1021
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,769
supposed to transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data out and</font>

1022
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:23,359
all of a sudden attention becomes bad if

1023
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:24,769
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at just the behaviors alone the</font>

1024
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,899
behaviors look identical at a high level

1025
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:28,970
it's the intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be different</font>

1026
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:31,039
and intent is something that's very very

1027
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to measure computationally I don't</font>

1028
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,999
know that any computer can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:36,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">moral</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Iser in our lifetimes but you know</font>

1030
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,489
it's an open-ended research maybe that

1031
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,499
something will come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some</font>

1032
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,899
point but for now that's a fundamental

1033
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,759
limitation and machine learning now what

1034
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:45,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it machine</font>

1035
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,979
learning going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reality</font>

1036
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,970
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out

1037
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:48,950
there that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not been thinking</font>

1038
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a long time machine learning is</font>

1039
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,629
great at being able to identify some of

1040
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:55,129
that expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> our horizons a bit it</font>

1041
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:56,299
definitely moves the needle on being

1042
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:58,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to do better job of threat</font>

1043
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:00,049
detection but it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not move the needle</font>

1044
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:01,609
as much as you might read about in a

1045
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:02,840
vendor white paper so it's really

1046
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:06,289
important to put some context<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1047
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,418
that take it with a grain of salt now

1048
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:09,769
finally I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a story</font>

1049
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,019
of happening me personally that I think

1050
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:13,999
illustrates this point a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years</font>

1051
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago I was working on a project involving</font>

1052
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:17,929
foul reputation so is what working on

1053
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,490
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do automatic</font>

1054
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,710
mutation using a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

1055
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,299
looking at and what not and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1056
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,190
any good technology to engineer likes to

1057
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:26,210
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on a side project</font>

1058
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">we cut that would be kind of interesting</font>

1059
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,499
had all this data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> file reputation I</font>

1060
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:32,658
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I could apply that data</font>

1061
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:34,369
to certificate reputations and I figure

1062
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">out something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the digital</font>

1063
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:37,970
certificates that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used to</font>

1064
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,330
sign the binder is associated with the

1065
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,409
files which ad reputation scores and the

1066
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea was the following if I have a bunch</font>

1067
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:47,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of files and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've got high reputation</font>

1068
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,889
then I can kind of infer that the

1069
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,679
corresponding certificate that was used

1070
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:54,139
in digitally signing those files should

1071
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,129
also have high reputation which then

1072
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:56,658
would lead me to believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in anything</font>

1073
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:58,879
else signed by that same certificate

1074
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,860
should likely have high reputation as

1075
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:02,449
well so it was a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use something</font>

1076
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,758
about Sol reputation to determine

1077
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not I could infer something</font>

1078
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:08,179
about certificate reputation and then in

1079
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:10,699
turn use information about certificate

1080
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,879
reputation to then infer something about

1081
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,759
file reputation and machine learning was

1082
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,710
at the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system so i started</font>

1083
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing some file replication when I had</font>

1084
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,679
to apply to certificate reputation I

1085
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,020
started collecting a lot of data as I

1086
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,399
would typically do and so I had a bunch

1087
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on certificates at a bunch of</font>

1088
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,699
that on files and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to just</font>

1089
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:33,290
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some ideas so I put my my data</font>

1090
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,759
on a spreadsheet i had made about<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty</font>

1091
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,500
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty thousand rows at the time and I</font>

1092
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,940
kind of reduced it down to just a

1093
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,980
handful of interesting certificates and

1094
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,220
roughly speaking the certificates kind

1095
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,199
of fell into one of two categories the

1096
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,969
first set of certificates were only

1097
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,069
being used to sign popular stuff really

1098
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:51,078
high reputation files think of things

1099
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:52,579
like Microsoft or Adobe or something of

1100
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,950
that nature everything those

1101
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:56,569
certificates were signing were really

1102
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:00,020
popular really high reputation nothing

1103
00:34:56,569 --> 00:35:01,308
strange or weird on the other hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1104
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,299
also saw some certificates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1105
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:05,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">being used to sign a lot of low</font>

1106
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:06,950
reputation files so things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad where</font>

1107
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,869
vendors very typically would sign their

1108
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,279
binaries but you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1109
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:11,990
were a drove<font color="#E5E5E5"> enders because the binary</font>

1110
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,069
is being signed were all kind of

1111
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,180
one-offs not very popular and whatnot

1112
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:18,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">but there was one mind on my spreadsheet</font>

1113
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,230
that was kind of throwing me off and it

1114
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:22,490
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> line 23 I vividly remember it and</font>

1115
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">its certificate it was being just find</font>

1116
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,629
some good things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were very popular</font>

1117
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:27,828
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation I was also being</font>

1118
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,410
used to find some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were very</font>

1119
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:31,550
very unpopular I had maybe one or two

1120
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,379
instances in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font>

1121
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,700
and that struck me is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird why</font>

1122
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,560
would a legitimate software company

1123
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,540
signed something but only give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1124
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,140
maybe one person but do that three

hundred times for 300 if ur intense side

something wrong with my data at some

00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,240
heard of hopefully Stuxnet now what's

1134
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,570
interesting is Stuxnet was digitally

1135
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,990
sign it were digitally signed by the

1136
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">real tech certificate which was line 23</font>

1137
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:11,359
of my spreadsheet so here I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1138
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,950
nobody knew about Stuxnet when I first

1139
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,630
looked at the spreadsheet<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and I was</font>

1140
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,819
staring at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the face it was</font>

1141
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally in front of me I could see</font>

1142
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,330

1143
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,080
fact a bunch that never were talk about

1144
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,730
publicly at the time and I missed it and

1145
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I head back on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a malware analysis i was</font>

1146
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,260
in security for a while I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

1147
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,640
a domain expert I was very humbled by

1148
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,890
the experience I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized hate for</font>

1149
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,210
everything I knew here are these Fred

1150
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,100
actors who completely threw me through a

1151
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,510
loop and I completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignored it I</font>

1152
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,799
missed all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the warning signs was months</font>

1153
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,900
later before I finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> put all this</font>

1154
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,940
together and I bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up because</font>

1155
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,520
this is really why machine learning is

1156
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,870
hard to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their life you know</font>

1157

we're not dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sweat actor</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hasn't figured out how to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1164
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,750
effectively now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that you can't</font>

1165
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,890
apply it and move the needle but you've

1166
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,350
got to be cognizant of the fact that

1167
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,089
there may be certain things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

1168
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:09,170
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the foreseeable future beyond the</font>

1169
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,140
scope of what machine learning can

1170
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,610
accomplish I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share also with you</font>

1171
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,529
some pitfalls of unsupervised machine

1172
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,480
learning these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are somewhat obvious but</font>

1173
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,060
I think it's important to note the

1174
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,740
reality is that people don't realize it

1175
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,060
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at unsupervised</font>

1176
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,700
learning it's really about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1177
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,170
find things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are out of the norm and</font>

1178
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,660
something being abnormal is not the same

1179
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,650
thing as being malicious for example i'm

1180
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,420
here today at the a number of beach

1181
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,850
house<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have never been here before in</font>

1182
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,810
my life i can assure you you know some

1183
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,100
machine learning system might be

1184
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,770
tripping up somewhere if it finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1185
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,210
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an anomaly for me</font>

1186
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,220
right so an almost behavior is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

1187
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,840
same thing as malicious behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1188
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,430
may be reasons why you behave an<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1189
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">mostly maybe</font>

1190
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,569
traveling maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a work deadline</font>

1191
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">so all of a sudden you're checking in</font>

1192
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,290
and out more code than you normally

1193
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,670
would maybe there's a holiday sale at

1194
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website that you're monitoring and</font>

1195
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,450
all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden they see a spike in</font>

1196
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,950
traffic that's abnormal normally

1197
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,319
abnormal but is actually perfectly

1198
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,270
reasonable within the context of a sale

1199
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:06,880
and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tricky you better</font>

1200
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,589
take into account not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just what you're</font>

1201
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,770
putting in but you've got to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1202
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:12,940
account whether or not the context

1203
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,460
suggest that that data should look at

1204
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,930
the way it does then finally it's

1205
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,819
actually not that easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure normal</font>

1206
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,799
behavior you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of look at logs</font>

1207
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:21,819
and whatnot so for example I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1208
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,319
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies try to look at</font>

1209
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:25,540
geolocation behavior and look for

1210
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:27,190
geolocation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like hey why was</font>

1211
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,750
Julie in China than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second later in</font>

1212
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,880
California and a second later somewhere

1213
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">else that's all fine and good but</font>

1214
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,230
geolocation baseline hard to measure I

1215
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,149
could use a mifi device I could use a

1216
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,160
VPN all those things will typically

1217
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:41,140
throw off to your location based

1218
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,368
solutions and so it turns out that if

1219
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't measure the data accurately</font>

1220
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:46,119
and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell whether or not</font>

1221
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,098
something is truly malicious versus

1222
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,720
abnormal it's very hard than to make

1223
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,250
inferences beyond that not even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

1224
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,779
could potentially do it let alone a

1225
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,430
machine learning algorithm so there are

1226
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">some fundamental pitfalls in trying to</font>

1227
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,078
make machine learning work in the real

1228
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,420
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really the mole the story is</font>

1229
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:03,069
that actions themselves are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the same</font>

1230
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,230
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the intent behind those actions</font>

1231
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:07,690
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to find out in our field is</font>

1232

the intent not the action<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've got</font>

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to town for that when we think about how</font>

talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one final topic which is</font>

forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this part right they think</font>

1243
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,559
that everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks good but there's a</font>

1244
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:31,359
subtle aspect of DevOps its associated

1245
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,859
machine learning and in fact this may be

1246
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,000
a right area for this community to think

1247
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,400
about is how do you actually think about

1248
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,230
DevOps in a machine learning context

1249
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,809
here's a great example<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay machine</font>

1250
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,880
learning through these models that malls

1251
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,290
got to be deployed so you need some way

1252
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,660
to vet whether the model being deployed

1253
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,950
is going to do a good job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course if</font>

1254
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,970
you had a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell whether the model</font>

1255
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:51,129
being deployed was going to do a good

1256
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,240
job then it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much easier to come</font>

1257
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,520
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those models that's a challenge</font>

1258
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,709
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a good model but it turns</font>

1259
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,290
out that there are situations in which

1260
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,870
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a model that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

1261
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,029
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an make sense and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1262
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,259
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but somehow you better figure</font>

1263
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">out whether that real model is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1264
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,710
work in real life<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for example let's</font>

1265
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that you're trying to find that you</font>

1266
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,530
I thought has happened in real life once

1267
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,940
somebody I knew a friend to develop a

1268
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,230
model for trying to detect malware and

1269
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,100
they applied machine learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use</font>

1270
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:20,260
the library and somehow the model picked

1271
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,779
up on the fact that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

1272
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,650
compile time for the binaries to figure

1273
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,870
out whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not something is</font>

1274
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,010
malicious here's a hint that probably

1275
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,109
won't work in real life that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1276
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,890
work really well on this data set but

1277
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,560
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of thing that you</font>

1278
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,910
could apply in the real world now if you

1279
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">just went ahead and blindly put that</font>

1280
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,790
actually actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did go ahead and blind</font>

1281
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,350
me for that model in real life that's a

1282
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,790
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> story but if you took a look</font>

1283
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,080
at the model and spend a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

1284
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,029
at it he would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well obviously the</font>

1285
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,410
compile time shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

1286
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,180
factor in determining what not something

1287
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,500
is malware since I've got a model that's

1288
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,529
really heavily dependent on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the compile</font>

1289
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,640
time it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the right model</font>

1290
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,810
it's a subtle point but you better find

1291
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,910
a way to determine whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

1292
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,840
model makes sense is the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1293
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to do really well on your</font>

1294
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,270
training set which in that case it was

1295
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">or do really poorly in real life and</font>

1296
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:05,560
more importantly let's say you do put

1297
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,810
the model in the field at some point if

1298
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,000
a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> support issue comes up the</font>

1299
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,410
person looking at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue may not</font>

1300
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,660
have a PhD in machine learning they may

1301
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,790
not understand the importance of maximum

1302
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,200
margin separation or even oral networks

1303
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,550
or any bad thing what they really care

1304
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is hey how do I fix a customer</font>

1305
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,910
issue to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1306
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,890
understand something about what was put

1307
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">in place but if the model is so</font>

1308
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,089
complicated and hard to understand and

1309
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:30,340
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no context that's really really</font>

1310
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,840
hard to do so it's really important to

1311
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,100
understand it from a support context

1312
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,720
you've got to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to deal</font>

1313
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,250
with machine learning and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1314
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,020
work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing I talked</font>

1315
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">about earlier about data then features</font>

1316
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,560
and model that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to pick a</font>

1317
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,509
simple model<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want something</font>

1318
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,620
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be understood potentially by</font>

1319
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,800
someone who does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have machine</font>

1320
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,720
learning background in the field so

1321
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">given all that I want to kind of quickly</font>

1322
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,589
summarize the key issues here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked</font>

1323
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about why I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine learning I think is</font>

1324
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,760
a very good tool for cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> security but</font>

1325
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,500
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip side does have a number of</font>

1326
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,510
caveats and pitfalls associated with it

1327
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,340
and that there are some realities to

1328
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,810
understand and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

1329
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,840
figure out when the height fails to meet

1330
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,460
the reality in terms of best practices

1331
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,860
start off by making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you focus</font>

1332
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,090
on data first then features then

1333
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,350
classifier

1334
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,820
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your time looking at</font>

1335
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,960
the features and classifier to not the

1336
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,730
data you're doing something wrong and

1337
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,140
you're spending too much time creaking

1338
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,700
parameters in your machine learning

1339
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,730
library you're definitely doing

1340
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,740
something wrong the second thing is you

1341
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,330
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what success means it's not</font>

1342
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,220
just about having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high crew positive</font>

1343
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,480
and a low false positive you better

1344
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,700
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a specific</font>

1345
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,110
scenario to which it's being applied if

1346
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,580
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those metrics are created equal</font>

1347
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:41,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we really dependent on the</font>

1348
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:43,660
scenario dealing with third don't set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1349
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,070
and forget it we're like Fred actors do

1350
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,730
adapt right there trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

1351
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,950
attention to what you're doing

1352
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if you're big and they're</font>

1353
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,069
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to modify their</font>

1354
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,299
behaviors to get by them they're trying

1355
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fly dress under the radar to</font>

1356
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,260
understand that you will and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1357
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,730
stuck that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great example a lot of</font>

1358
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,070
antivirus vendors weren't calling things

1359
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:03,010
that were digitally signed by class who

1360
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,390
certificates malicious and so Fred

1361
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,170
actors figure that out and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> found a</font>

1362
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,970
way to compromise the class you

1363
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,950
certificate and find something with it

1364
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:12,009
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adapt their behaviors</font>

1365
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:13,569
you can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> set it and forget it then</font>

1366
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,710
finally you've got to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to</font>

1367
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,840
put those models in the field

1368
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,760
successfully and realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font>

1369
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,950
putting it into the field may not be the

1370
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,030
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who developed it and</font>

1371
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,589
typically will not understand all the

1372
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,780
nuances of what that model might mean

1373
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,340
and so as you start to develop models in

1374
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,330
machine learning you've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1375
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,430
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make the model may be</font>

1376
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,500
sufficiently simple or provide some of

1377
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,970
the right context or explain ability so

1378
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,940
someone can actually create an infield

1379
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:38,230
issue so with that I think machine

1380
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,130
learning has a lot of promise I don't

1381
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,230
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it seem like it's all</font>

1382
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,400
negative but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we</font>

1383
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,050
provide a balance here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can</font>

1384
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,420
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to any vendor booth read a white</font>

1385
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,620
paper and get the positives of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1386
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,540
typical vendor won't tell you where it

1387
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,859
might not work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the same time</font>

1388
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,110
machine learning has been used for a

1389
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,670
long time I guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1390
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,770
major cyber security vendors on the

1391
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,350
planet have been doing it successfully

1392
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,550
and moving the needle with it but I

1393
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be careful with</font>

00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the height versus the reality so with</font>

that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys back</font>
