1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,560
thank you everybody for both making it

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,660
here after<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch and making it upstairs</font>

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,470
after launch the combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually impressive for a talk cool</font>

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,820
intro we got that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the way I</font>

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,369
started out at itec partners if you know

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,790
I sec partners or MTC pentesting

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,590
consulting all sorts of fun with that

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,570
moved over to defense I was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first T</font>

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,680
so at Etsy and built and ran the four

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,969
different security groups there and then

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,739
several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago left with my</font>

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,870
co-founders and co-founded signal

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sciences really take those lessons</font>

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,730
learned at Etsy of an organization going

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,070
through the shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dev ops and cloud</font>

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,779
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a product that you can drop</font>

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,360
in to defender web applications right

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">really take years of engineering effort</font>

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,539
and pain and turn that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a product</font>

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you drop in and actually defend</font>

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,320
your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> app sir cool what's this talk</font>

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,089
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in spite of the</font>

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,119
incredibly long title that managed to

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,430
use I think sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps dev ops sec and</font>

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,880
dev sec ups or something in there it's

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,740
yeah I tried to go for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them it's</font>

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">really about this is the talk i wish i</font>

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,839
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have given myself eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,880
when a starry-eyed etsy of hey you're an

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,030
organization going through the shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">devops going through the shift to cloud</font>

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,189
what are the lessons learned in terms of

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,500
how do you need to adapt your sdlc so a

35
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,020
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago actually here at eps at</font>

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,729
california i gave a very different

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,920
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk which was how do</font>

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapt kind of the culture of your</font>

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">security team and adapt the culture of</font>

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,530
interaction with the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,539
organization this one is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">other side of that coin it's how do we</font>

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,250
actually adapt our technical controls of

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,750
the sdlc so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll go</font>

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,890
through all this but like how do we

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,299
adapt the things that we've been doing

47
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the apps tech programs that we've</font>

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,250
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> building to actually be effective</font>

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,439
in this sort of new world so I

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,050
deliberately wrote this talk is like 30

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,340
to 40 minutes so that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,930
that you wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to me</font>

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that long which is always a</font>

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,870
good thing

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,760
and be that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait till</font>

56
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions so please as you</font>

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,200
have comments questions booing

58
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,910
obscenities anything just shot them out

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,859
or raise your hand or whatever and let's

60
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,370
actually dive into stuff we've got time

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk so the spoiler</font>

62
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,480
alert except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you manic oh you're not</font>

63
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,500
sorry every that applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to everyone</font>

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,750
except Monica so the spoiler alert is

65
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,960
that security shifts from being this

66
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">gatekeeper to actually enabling teams to</font>

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,920
be secured by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default this is I think</font>

68
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,649
anything that you boil up to one

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,179
sentence is going to sound cliché but

70
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,430
it doesn't make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> untrue right this is</font>

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,990
actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,150
we need to adapt our security programs

73
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,890
is we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enable these teams by</font>

74
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,480
default rather than being<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

75
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,640
gatekeeper that says I've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font>

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,649
off on everything before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes live or</font>

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,109
anything like that those days were great

78
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,890
they were the late 90s and we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

79
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,560
them anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed a bunch</font>

80
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,700
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so all kind of this</font>

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,530
is kind of setting the stage and I'm

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the different ways</font>

83
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,860
in which we adapt the sdlc the first is

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,080
that change happens orders of magnitude

85
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,880
faster than it used to how many folks

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,530
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> waved through I'm probably dating</font>

87
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,299
myself here but how many folks have

88
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,700
lived<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the waterfall era of</font>

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,300
software development<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yeah right it was</font>

90
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,670
any adventure to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least the</font>

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of times that that I've heard in</font>

92
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,420
past lives they're like oh yeah that

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,280
sequel injection fix didn't make it into

94
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:53,329
into this cycle so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll it'll be live</font>

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,310
in 24 months like okay right awesome

96
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,170
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where we're going now which</font>

97
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,710
is that you know organizations that used

98
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,359
to deploy every 18 months are now

99
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,300
heading toward their on this journey to

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,100
deploying every month or every week or

101
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,750
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day or every hour or even less</font>

102
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,200
right you see the leading organizations

103
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,798
deploying fifty a hundred times a day

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,358
where the leading organizations 8 10

105
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,549
years ago we're deploying once a week

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was considered insane in terms</font>

107
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,229
of velocity and from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skier</font>

108
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,660
perspective it's that we used to have

109
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,979
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of many injection points into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,680
process right if you're releasing every

111
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,199
18 months well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can do our design</font>

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,639
reviews<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in January we can do some</font>

113
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,190
pen testing in September we can do the

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,889
fixes and next februari and we can kind

115
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,210
of build like that too while we were

116
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,009
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sentence that code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

117
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,289
actually gone live to production and so

118
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,300
you're the way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

119
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,639
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the team radically changes</font>

120
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,889
which seems super scary at first by the

121
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,030
way right spoiler alert of what I'm

122
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to by the end is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

123
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just makes us safer this</font>

124
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:07,810
actually is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> net-positive on security</font>

125
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,060
and then the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decentralized ownership</font>

126
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,130
of deployment right it used to be used

127
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,069
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the the oregon trail of dev</font>

128
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,650
daqui way to security back to dev dis<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

129
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:20,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">opted to prod it becomes dev to</font>

130
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,299
production and so the change<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is not</font>

131
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other steps go away if those</font>

132
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,710
are all going away like something that's

133
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,859
gone catastrophic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee off the rails what</font>

134
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,299
changes is that now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other facets</font>

135
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,729
that used to belong and there's a

136
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,009
security key way anything like a

137
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,139
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing that needs to be</font>

138
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,849
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the development team into</font>

139
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,130
the dev ops team so that they can they

140
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,680
can do that as part of their job and

141
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,020
that the link down here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

142
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,900
talk that I gave here two years ago on

143
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,210
how we need to shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> the culture along</font>

144
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,400
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> these technology ships as well so</font>

145
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,680
the new reality in this is that security

146
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,138
cannot be outsourced to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore right in</font>

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the waterfall world it was you have</font>

148
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,969
all these groups that ticket over kick

149
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,740
you know a code drop or whatever over

150
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,620
the fence<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another group so oh I wrote</font>

151
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,560
some code I kick it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to QA they kick it</font>

152
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,900
to another group to to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,250
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets ticked over to sis ops to</font>

154
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,810
deploy to production and it's in

155
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,250
production 12 months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

156
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,690
developer actually wrote the code and

157
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,949
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security issue gets discovered</font>

158
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,240
then you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer and</font>

159
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,039
they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I don't know that was</font>

160
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,599
15 months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago like I don't I don't</font>

161
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember what I was doing on vacation</font>

162
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:34,389
then let alone like the code I wrote so

163
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,210
the the real mission of security it

164
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,979
changes from being this<font color="#CCCCCC"> outsourced group</font>

165
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,330
to handle it for you to actually

166
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,400
securities entire

167
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,099
job in this modern world is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

168
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,169
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make different development teams and</font>

169
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:50,349
dev ops teams security self-sufficient

170
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,818
that's our focus now is it's not trying

171
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,560
to hey we're to come in and fix

172
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,289
everything for you it's here's how you

173
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,389
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually build secure systems by</font>

174
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:00,610
yourself and then security becomes this

175
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:04,060
kind of services organization to help on

176
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,310
top of that security put another way it

177
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,060
really only becomes successful in this

178
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,620
DevOps cloud agile world if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can bake</font>

179
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,039
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development and the DevOps</font>

180
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,620
process so technical diagrams coming up

181
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,139
how does legacy how do legacy aptech

182
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,080
approaches actually fair if you take our

183
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sdlc approach from 10 years ago and you</font>

184
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,099
try to drop it into a modern you just

185
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,400
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not adapt it and just go into the</font>

190
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,909
this so it could not actually explode

191
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:44,740
the fire here but it's what so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

192
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:46,479
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's kind of the these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font>

193
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,029
meant to be exhaustive by the way this

<font color="#CCCCCC">is meant as here's kind of select</font>

195
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:54,669
components of these are kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

196
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,979
primitives that were all used to in

197
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,169
terms of controls that we need in our

198
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:01,150
sdlc right whether that's developer

199
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,589
training or threat modeling or design

200
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,039
reviews that analysis all the way

201
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:07,870
through right so which of these were

202
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,400
constrained by time while we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,020
room so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about all</font>

204
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,339
of those what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

205
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,589
are the ones that are actually molded

206
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:17,469
here this does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be</font>

207
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:20,319
extremely explicit this does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not mean</font>

208
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:22,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you stop doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these other things it</font>

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">just means as a function of being in a</font>

210
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,740
40 minute time slot here today<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage</font>

211
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,599
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> five that we're actually</font>

212
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,699
going to get through so those are ones

213
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to focus on these other ones they</font>

214
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:36,159
don't go away they somewhat change they

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,159
somewhat don't and we can talk about

216
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,130
those hopefully next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

217
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,680
jumping into static analysis how many

218
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have lived through a well let me</font>

219
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,609
put it this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I was</font>

220
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,920
on stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this I asked what</font>

221
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,589
was the the largest static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

222
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,079
report anybody has ever seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

223
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:55,700
just

224
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,370
in tins of false positives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

225
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,610
the record<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like 9,000</font>

226
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,020
issues from one run what's the largest

227
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:11,420
one that anyone who's seen in here of

228
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:13,250
stagnant yeah 25 yes 25,000 yeah just

229
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,079
you you r it you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugged in</font>

230
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,060
fortify you hit go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

231
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:24,380
oh my god what<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I done yeah hundred</font>

232
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,880
pounds awesome awesome the whiskey will

233
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,990
be in the back soon don't worry we've

234
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,430
all we've all been<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so static</font>

235
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,720
analysis telling me to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

236
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,370
these sections by the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

237
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the same sort of format it's I</font>

238
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about the way in which we did</font>

239
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,770
them in kind of a legacy environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

240
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">they talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we adapt that</font>

241
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,810
control so static analysis has really

242
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,020
traditionally been done as this very

243
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,479
heavy weight process it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been</font>

244
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,110
very top-down right it's that you you

245
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,400
buy a commercial static analysis or you

246
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,630
try to get like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source one</font>

247
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,980
although I'm really you know talking

248
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,900
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a while ago here so you</font>

249
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,930
bought like an early commercial one you

250
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,970
hit go and you get this mountain of

251
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,130
issues that that come out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the</font>

252
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,740
predominantly false positives right and

253
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,840
so typically what how you'd see that get

254
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,230
adapted in organizations is that you'd

255
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,290
run that once a week once a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

256
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,820
get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large output and the dirty</font>

257
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">secret of that is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you typically see</font>

258
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,110
is organizations where security ran that

259
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,580
and then they get the PDF output and

260
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,930
they hit forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the email to the</font>

261
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,550
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> team they're like oh sweet</font>

262
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,079
the development teams totally going to

263
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,810
dig through this and weed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

264
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,850
real issues meanwhile meanwhile back at

265
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,410
the Batcave of development is that

266
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,390
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> just emailed another one of</font>

267
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,010
those attachments just if it says you

268
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,170
know static analysis and title just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

269
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,400
it to spam it's got 9,000 false

270
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,430
positives in it and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ship</font>

271
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:50,150
features and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to do that as this</font>

272
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,729
very top-down right turn everything on

273
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:56,959
and then let's spend 18 months actually

274
00:10:52,730 --> 00:11:00,590
making it work the truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> the / sad truth</font>

275
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,590
is that this was sort of acceptable ish

276
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,930
in that environment because if you if

277
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,180
you're releasing software<font color="#E5E5E5"> every 18</font>

278
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:12,949
months and it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

279
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,899
to actually tune these systems so let's

280
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">say you you drop one of these systems in</font>

281
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,620
place and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you 12</font>

282
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,720
months to do it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh actually you're</font>

283
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,880
only really losing one development cycle

284
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,120
there on that to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going it was</font>

285
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,600
acceptable ish so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

286
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,820
adapt this so what we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is we</font>

287
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,640
shift from this top-down heavyweight

288
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,520
model to actually building bottoms up on

289
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,990
this sort of model so ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

290
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,839
the way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you get started here</font>

291
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,610
now to be very clear what you want to

292
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
ideally the ideal case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

293
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in both cases you kind of</font>

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,980
meet in the middle and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get good</font>

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,300
enough coverage where you've got good

296
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,860
enough coverage that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

297
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,689
willing to invest more resources and

298
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,970
tuning or anything like that and you're

299
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,070
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> good bang for your buck what</font>

300
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,110
changes in the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps world here</font>

301
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see I CD and agile and everything</font>

302
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,770
like that is you don't start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

303
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">heavyweight system you start from</font>

304
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,089
nothing and you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here</font>

305
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,399
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first vulnerability class that I</font>

306
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,880
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about let me turn something on for</font>

307
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,709
that and get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> going so I'll give you</font>

308
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,100
practical examples of this on next

309
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,689
slides but you really the focus goes on

310
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,930
enabling velocity and eliminating false

311
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,980
positives rather than rather than saying

312
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,109
oh we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get coverage for</font>

313
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,959
everything theoretically but in reality

314
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,310
or not so once you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like one</font>

315
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,079
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> volan class you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

316
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> well now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out a second now you</font>

317
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,490
had a third and you build bottoms up

318
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,290
from there this really enables the

319
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,790
velocity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need in this sort of</font>

320
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,319
DevOps environment to be able to

321
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,240
actually run static analysis on every

322
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,830
commitment right where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

323
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,580
running it once a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in forwarding</font>

324
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,350
this heavyweight report so an example of

325
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,180
that is you pick the easiest easiest

326
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,360
start with a lot of times that's

327
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,310
actually command execution because often

328
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I put this in here semi sarcastically of</font>

329
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,390
gripping for system has a low false

330
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,190
positive rate but the reality is like if

331
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,620
you're looking for command execution to

332
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,029
start like they're fairly few paths to

333
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're able to really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font>

334
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,439
that very effectively where Oh in our

335
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,540
particular technology choices this is

336
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,700
what command execution can look like in

337
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sex act cool here's the six things i</font>

338
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,020
actually just need to grep for great

339
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,860
bang<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next one now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can build</font>

340
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">up to</font>

341
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:29,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">or more effective ones the focus is not</font>

342
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">only on findings I think that this kind</font>

343
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:33,170
of this is a trap that we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall</font>

344
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,180
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our security is that just focus on</font>

345
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> findings that the larger because you</font>

346
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,019
can win the battle there but still lose

347
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,149
the war of bringing this to your your

348
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:43,339
development program which is you want to

349
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to demonstrate that this new</font>

350
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,540
approach to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this control can actually</font>

351
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,219
function in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this modern world that when</font>

352
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,680
you're talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your development teams</font>

353
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,660
or to your dev op teams say hey we built

354
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,099
this new approach in terms of how we're

355
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,410
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about static</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis as a</font>

356
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,959
control it can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> function as</font>

357
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,630
quick as you need it to and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

358
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:04,250
we're improving the capabilities of it

359
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,810
all the time so right now you're only

360
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,329
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get reports if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're SATA if</font>

361
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,859
their command execution in two months

362
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:11,479
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them for sequel</font>

363
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,959
injection another month after that for

364
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,130
XSS you're going to keep building up

365
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,180
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep building up the coverage</font>

366
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're actually getting from these</font>

367
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,380
systems and it allows you to demonstrate

368
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,199
velocity and demonstrate that yeah this

369
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,850
control if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we properly adapt it actually</font>

370
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,850
still really has a place in our program

371
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,959
continuing on with static analysis so

372
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,459
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the longer</font>

373
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,768
sections of that the five of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I talked</font>

374
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:39,170
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also start</font>

375
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:42,680
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really effective things that are</font>

376
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,449
really dumb in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

377
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,519
great because they are you can just grep

378
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:48,560
for them or you can just do very simple

379
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,660
checks that actually give you a ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

380
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,089
bang for your buck so identifying

381
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,529
certain primitives that rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just</font>

382
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,060
being blocked they should actually

383
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:57,890
initiate a conversation with the

384
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,060
security team right if you're if you've

385
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,500
got a development group that suddenly

386
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,779
starts making use of encryption

387
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,670
functions when they've never done that

388
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,990
before that should probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

389
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,760
blocked but it should drive a

390
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,680
conversation with the security team of

391
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,050
hey we noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're suddenly calling</font>

392
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,519
AES or you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow you</font>

393
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,579
started calling beds or something like

394
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,620
that what are you what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font>

395
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,599
building here how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we be how can we</font>

396
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">be helpful in this and it's able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

397
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,769
this more as a alerting function to the

398
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,750
security team that hey there's something

399
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,430
happening over here in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> base not</font>

400
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,250
necessarily it should be blocked but it

401
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,319
should drive a conversation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

402
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,420
kind of old example of this that I've

403
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,180
seen in so many organizations

404
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,740
is that oh we have static analysis

405
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,900
checks<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a if you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce</font>

406
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,780
md5 into the code base you get blocked

407
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,050
but if you redo that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-256 like</font>

408
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:51,260
good to go that's not wrong the problem

409
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,550
is that that's not necessarily actually

410
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,020
giving you the best bang for your buck

411
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,370
of how you should be thinking about a

412
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,439
particular application<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

413
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,030
particular code it's more just because

414
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,490
you silently approved like a particular

415
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,020
hashing function it doesn't help in the

416
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,490
case where that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the right</font>

417
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,480
thing that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing where</font>

418
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,040
they should have been encrypting the

419
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,900
data instead of hashing it or anything

420
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,469
like that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so instead of using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

421
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,540
just as a blank kind of policy that says

422
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,610
this is blocked this is allowed you can

423
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,230
still do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the real value is then</font>

424
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,480
saying on the stuff that's allowed I

425
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,680
want an alert about it happening in my

426
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,630
code base so that i can drive

427
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,770
conversations there and actually see

428
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,330
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this particular</font>

429
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:32,300
team the final bid on this is really

430
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,040
knowing when certain sensitive just like

431
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,079
knowing when something new is entering

432
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,540
the code base lots of times we're all

433
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,980
dealing with huge legacy code bases

434
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,810
right we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with brand new</font>

435
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,200
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just know what's going on</font>

436
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,819
already but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you typically want to</font>

437
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,400
know out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and what's really</font>

438
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,140
really useful is hey there are certain

439
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,430
very sensitive portions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code</font>

440
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,920
base whether it's brand new or whether

441
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's legacy you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know when they</font>

442
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,240
actually change so much of the core

443
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,520
sensitive business logic or

444
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,590
authorization primitives or encryption

445
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,510
rappers or session management right you

446
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,310
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff once and then you never</font>

447
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,930
really need to update it that much maybe

448
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,540
you're updating to rotate keys or

449
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,790
something like that but if someone

450
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,260
changes the like core session management

451
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,899
of the way that you generate and store

452
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,700
session cookies you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

453
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">know about that right and it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

454
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,980
again it might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be blocked it might</font>

455
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,449
be a like comment change or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

456
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,680
like that but you want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

457
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,330
somebody is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing that part</font>

458
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,100
of your code get is code base because it

459
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,710
almost never happens all right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

460
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,000
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good signal-to-noise of somebody</font>

461
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,650
just changed the sensitive part of the

462
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,270
code base let's actually drive a

463
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,690
conversation off of it let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

464
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,100
block this out right<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right moving on</font>

465
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,320
to dynamic scanning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

466
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,719
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sip of water first so now it's</font>

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:59,120
I said anybody but Monica good wait I

469
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,970
got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so in order to allow my</font>

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:07,039
thank you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> by these super expensive</font>

472
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:10,070
DevOps rules neuter all of their mission

473
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,820
capability down to one maybe two small

474
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:18,460
features and slowly amp it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time</font>

475
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,470
maybe it is it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neutering of</font>

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive important tool that's my</font>

478
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,000
absolutely if you're saying if that was

479
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,139
the end point that oh you only you buy

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,580
this big expensive tool when you only

481
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,909
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for one thing like that would</font>

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful whatsoever right think of</font>

that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the starting point to the point</font>

484
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,850
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to and you're</font>

485
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,890
starting from I'm only going to

486
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,980
introduce new pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

487
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:49,340
effective versus I'm going to drown my

488
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:53,260
developers in 50,000 false positives and

489
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,260
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slowly turn that down</font>

490
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,158
totally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

491
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,480
sass tool I think you bring up a really

492
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,280
good point which is that depending on

493
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">your individual technology choice there</font>

494
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,760
it might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that you turn down all</font>

495
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,080
the categories and you start with one

496
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you go to a second you go to a</font>

497
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,460
third it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly as you</font>

498
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,080
described you turn it so that it's only

499
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,690
extremely high confidence across all

500
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,570
your categories and then you work into

501
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,520
yeah from super high confidence to the

502
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">high confidence the medium to low it's</font>

503
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,990
more the idea here rather than the you

504
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,299
have to it this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not prescriptive of</font>

505
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,610
you have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> volan class by von Klaus</font>

506
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">its start with high confidence whether</font>

507
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,668
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Volin class by bone</font>

508
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,070
class or by confidence rating and build

509
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:03,470
up right build bottoms up instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

510
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:07,090
top down<font color="#CCCCCC"> all yellow on for everything</font>

511
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll get there from there</font>

512
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:35,149
totally totally so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> repeat it</font>

513
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the mic and everything there and</font>

514
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:39,350
yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if I screwed up it's that</font>

515
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,450
what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at first describing their</font>

516
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,820
seems very effective for either a new

517
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,830
code base or a legacy code base that has

518
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,870
very low instances of particular issues

519
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,580
but then if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

520
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,239
legacy code base that has a ton of

521
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,100
instances or there's just a number of

522
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in there like how does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this fall</font>

523
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,789
over is that fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay absolutely</font>

524
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I've run in the same issues</font>

525
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:03,019
which is that what you do on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

526
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,730
is you've got a backlog at that point

527
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,919
and so the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found that to be</font>

528
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,960
most effective is you turn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this rule</font>

529
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,269
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm you know what we're off</font>

530
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,980
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new instances I've now got a backlog</font>

531
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,750
of you said like 300 I've got a backlog

532
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,549
of 300 that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to weed through</font>

533
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,710
reviews on those and see if there were

534
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:21,500
real issues there or that was whatever

535
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,090
but you separated out to say here's how

536
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,519
I've got an effective control from this

537
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,769
point forward and here's my backlog of

538
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,389
work and I add it to my mountain of

539
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:30,740
backlog of work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else and</font>

540
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,479
I mean a prioritize that appropriately

541
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,970
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's not something where you</font>

542
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,500
say okay it's only once i get through

543
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,179
this backlog that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i introduce this or</font>

544
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,669
anything there you separate the work

545
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:43,269
into different piles does that sometimes

546
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:43,269
cool

547
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,129
our pipeline like we have to write some

548
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,689
glue<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think the thing can't just be</font>

549
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:53,149
like there was output from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school</font>

550
00:21:50,690 --> 00:22:03,080
yes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on during the</font>

552
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:16,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree totally agree not yeah and just</font>

553
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:22,970
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> block on commit out of tool</font>

554
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:26,990
output yeah totally that's yeah exactly

555
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,240
if output of random tool is more than

556
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,580
zero block code commit yeah that's a

557
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,750
that's a good recipe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be finding a new</font>

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:39,230
probably one would<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope dynamic scanning</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this section super short actually which</font>

561
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that I'll give you it in</font>

562
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,639
the pld are right up front which is that

563
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think dynamics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Canyon task like shifts</font>

564
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:51,500
from where we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it used to be just kind of</font>

570
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,809
baseline of run the scanner if it finds

571
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,178
issues like we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably fix that</font>

572
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see organizations occasionally miss</font>

573
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,169
you that as pen testing and saying oh no

574
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,230
we ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scanner so like not get your</font>

575
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:14,830
pen testing how does this actually adapt

576
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,690
it really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is that</font>

577
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,779
application architecture has changed so

578
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,279
radically since the early to mid-2000s

579
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,649
of when these sort of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

580
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,750
was built that modern apps are really

581
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:28,189
far too complex to get that sort of

582
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,470
coverage anymore I'm not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

583
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,389
impossible by any means I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that</font>

584
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,850
in terms of bang for the buck right

585
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:36,860
we're all under water in our jobs in

586
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,449
terms of the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security projects</font>

587
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,439
we need to do you're banging<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

588
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">best bang for your buck is elsewhere</font>

589
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,350
then trying to like teach vast tools how

590
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,929
to effectively crawl your now you know

591
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,779
written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> react client-side app that it</font>

592
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:52,490
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the old case</font>

593
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,919
there's just there's not as much value

594
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,840
there anymore what is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable</font>

595
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,549
here is that

596
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,250
ensuring that security policies are

597
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:04,010
actually being enforced right reset for

598
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,559
this app we'd rolled out TLS if you a

599
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,658
dynamic scanner run and see if you ever

600
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,309
find a link inside this domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

601
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,559
pointing to http I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about</font>

602
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:15,168
that immediately I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

603
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,389
I've invested a ton in CSP I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

604
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I ever hit pages where CSP is not</font>

605
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,470
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> being set or that frame options</font>

606
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,960
header or any of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> security policies</font>

607
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,900
are not being met it's a very cheap but

608
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,520
effective use of dynamic scanning and

609
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,460
the second is really around regressions

610
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:35,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I had a let's take a</font>

611
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,580
completely cliche example I had XSS in

612
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:40,039
the search box well I'm gonna make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

613
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,120
to point my dynamic standing in addition

614
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,980
to all the unit testing and other

615
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,750
regression testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing this is</font>

616
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,059
just a cheap additional control on that

617
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say hey hit this page post this</font>

618
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,500
parameter and if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> get JavaScript</font>

619
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,539
back like flag that as a regression

620
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,510
right there it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> very effective in</font>

621
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:58,190
that sort of that sort of use case

622
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright moving on to security visibility</font>

623
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,260
if you don't follow honest the odds that

624
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,510
stage on twitter by the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

625
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,279
painfully accurate which is just

626
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,779
searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your name and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font>

627
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">then alert you know our service is</font>

628
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:13,580
probably down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of space palms</font>

629
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:17,360
i have seen from that that Twitter is

630
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:20,360
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the way that visibility</font>

631
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,000
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really work is that we really</font>

632
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">had all these different siloed pieces of</font>

633
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,990
data whether that was logs whether that

634
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,270
was customer service reports or outages

635
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,820
or anything like that and each source of

636
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:33,950
information was really isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

637
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,658
ops maybe had logs and customer support

638
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,760
dealt with angry customers that said

639
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,190
your third page of your checkout flow is

640
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,320
not loading I can't buy anything and

641
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,980
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> debs would get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paged for certain</font>

642
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,289
outages or on call or anything like that

643
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,659
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we adapt this control it's that</font>

644
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,039
this is where we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete we</font>

645
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,980
don't have to relearn this lesson

646
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,260
ourselves this is what DevOps had to

647
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,909
learn and its infancy is that the way in

648
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,090
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps actually became very</font>

649
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:03,710
effective was in cliche alert again but

650
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,959
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about breaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down the silos</font>

651
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,000
between these pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the organization</font>

652
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,409
so that they would all have their

653
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,040
relevant context and they could move

654
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:12,350
quicker

655
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,030
result security is going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

656
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,070
same realization right now that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

657
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is that break down</font>

658
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,240
the silos between the different pieces

659
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,400
of the organization so that security can

660
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,020
empower them and security can have the

661
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,910
context from those pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

662
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,639
organization to really know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

663
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:31,730
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you an example of this</font>

664
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,770
which is so I'll tell you have a graph

665
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,720
of 500 errors from your application and

666
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,990
you see a big spike in that this

667
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,420
provokes wildly different responses from

668
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,490
your dev team which is like up the

669
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,000
intern push to prod looks like stuff

670
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:49,640
broken to the dev ops team which is like

671
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,500
why am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being paged again to security</font>

672
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,840
which is like maybe that's somebody

673
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,730
actually discovering a valid bug in the

674
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,320
app and triggering errors to your

675
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,970
attackers or your pen testers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like I</font>

676
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,830
am definitely discovering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bug in</font>

677
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,900
your app and exploiting it it's

678
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,030
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody has different</font>

679
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,220
context on this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real lesson</font>

680
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,379
learned out of this is start to match

681
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,080
this up with different sets of data from

682
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,700
around the organization so that

683
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,860
everybody can look at this and get this

684
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,780
sort of visibility in this context right

685
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you can bring different pieces of</font>

686
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,460
context of operational development

687
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,920
security data together and provide that

688
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,300
visibility now everybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will put</font>

689
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,870
this together can start to have the

690
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,220
context of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I'm bringing</font>

691
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">on bring it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the space means back</font>

692
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,990
it's like 17 years old now so I feel

693
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">incredibly old but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel bad</font>

694
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting a 17 year old name on a slide</font>

695
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,570
why not feedback so typically how we did

696
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,460
feedback was as<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test and that was</font>

697
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,860
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> done annually right you'd run</font>

698
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,640
the pen test it really answered for you

699
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">do I have bugs spoiler yes you always</font>

700
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,400
have bugs right they're always going to

701
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:01,360
exist the the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when we were</font>

702
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:06,470
on 12 months 18-month release cycles

703
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,240
again acceptable ish enough because if

704
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,560
you're running a pen test every 12

705
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,000
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you were releasing every 18</font>

706
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,780
you're getting some actual feedback

707
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,610
there how do we adapt this control and

708
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,100
this is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about bug</font>

709
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:23,030
Donnie's a little bit here is that bug

710
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,020
bounty really becomes I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited</font>

711
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,690
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bounced</font>

712
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,760
we we launched one back at Etsy when

713
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,470
there was none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their like hacker one</font>

714
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,320
or a bug crowd or any of the really cool

715
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,960
services around it and lost probably

716
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,970
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks of sleep because of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

717
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,290
it's really effective I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key to</font>

718
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,570
note here is that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

719
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,639
replacement for other controls it has

720
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really strong pros and cons just like</font>

721
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,020
all of your other controls and what I

722
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,659
really like is that the combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

723
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,820
bug bounty and pen test gives you this

724
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,910
nice kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sweet spot of coverage</font>

725
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,000
around testing there it's that the real

726
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,920
value in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion of bug bounties is</font>

727
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,390
in the continuous nature of it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

728
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,000
always have some testing going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there</font>

729
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,130
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're probably not getting</font>

730
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,200
the direct wall you're definitely not

731
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,820
getting the direction of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pen</font>

732
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
test whether getting the depth of them

733
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,600
is a different question and that's

734
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally up for argument but the value of</font>

735
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,040
how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them in conjunction is</font>

736
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,320
to say hey for my pen tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

737
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,690
use them on this pre-release feature or

738
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,810
I want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on this deep and</font>

739
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,910
dark scary bit of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> codebase over here</font>

740
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:31,070
that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else ever looks at I can</font>

741
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually direct my pen test very</font>

742
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,870
effectively whereas with bounty I can

743
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,090
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this nice overall coverage and it's</font>

744
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,280
continuous there and it gives me much

745
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:43,959
more real-time feedback in terms of

746
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,430
where I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be focusing my efforts I</font>

747
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,920
mean a pause for a second and take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

748
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:53,270
breath<font color="#CCCCCC"> them any questions so far on this</font>

749
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,780
part or hecka<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leonore trollee cool we'll</font>

750
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,780
come back to ya

751
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:13,529
yeah interesting so I think what shifts

752
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:17,039
there so the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the comment</font>

753
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:19,619
correct me where I'm wrong was since

754
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,999
launching<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounty and then continuing</font>

755
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,499
your pen test program you're getting

756
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,909
much less signal from your pen test

757
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:28,139
program after a bounty launch is that

758
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:30,299
fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the key</font>

759
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,099
there where I've seen cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah if you're</font>

760
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,168
still doing your pen testing as like

761
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,059
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general sanity check which</font>

762
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:37,950
is how we've really used pen testing in

763
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:40,109
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> I completely agree i think the</font>

764
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,389
value of that goes down I think where

765
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,849
the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pen testing stays the same</font>

766
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:47,428
or increases or decreases depend on how

767
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:49,320
you're looking at it is in the specific

768
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,779
direction of it its shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> and testers</font>

769
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,849
don't give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an overall assessment of</font>

770
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,320
this I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to focus on this area</font>

771
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:57,089
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like I'm getting</font>

772
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,678
coverage of that from my bounty or from

773
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,719
the other assessment that's going on and

774
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,629
the kind of highly directional nature of

775
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:05,369
that whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in you want to put</font>

776
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:07,349
that on particular pre-release software

777
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:08,999
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right whether its</font>

778
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:10,559
direction because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not out yet or</font>

779
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,719
its direction because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been running</font>

780
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,759
this bounty program for two years and

781
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:16,200
we've never seen an issue in this piece

782
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,539
even though we've run bonuses and

783
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,879
everything there because guess what it's

784
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,799
like five layers deep inside an API and

785
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,478
it's a complete pain to actually test it

786
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,309
none of my bounty people really care I

787
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:27,419
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> direct my pen testers there</font>

788
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:29,789
because I have a real contractual

789
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:38,719
relationship with them does that make

790
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:42,229
sense I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing there is</font>

791
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:44,879
can't can't I do something similar by

792
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:46,979
can't I steer my bounty program with

793
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:48,748
treasure maps and what have you totally

794
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:50,429
and get the same output I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

795
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out it's starting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel for me</font>

796
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:53,879
anyway it's starting to feel like it's

797
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">very duplicated effort totally no I</font>

798
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:57,899
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's gonna depend on your</font>

799
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,129
environment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

800
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're seeing the sort of treasure map</font>

801
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:03,748
stuff and I'm super excited about that

802
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,339
honestly like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

803
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:07,139
cool use of bounties and how you start

804
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,519
to incentivize it I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> think at the</font>

805
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:10,110
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day your relationship with</font>

806
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,250
your bounty researchers for

807
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,840
is your relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your pen</font>

808
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,120
testers is going to fundamentally be a

809
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,620
different one and that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you</font>

810
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">can direct your pen testers more</font>

811
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,030
effectively now giving your environment

812
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,799
it might be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case that yeah you can</font>

813
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,899
direct them just as it you can direct

814
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,820
your researchers just as well via a

815
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,620
treasure map because you know it's not

816
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,889
actually complex to test this part it's

817
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,750
just no one knew to test it vs this part

818
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,280
is super complex to test and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

819
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,360
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get any bounty researchers</font>

820
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,160
to look at it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to hire</font>

821
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,928
specialized pen testers for it right i

822
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's there's no prescriptive oh</font>

823
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,679
it's this is a hard line between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

824
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,290
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that that's why they're so</font>

825
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,630
exciting is that they're blurring the

826
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,100
line between each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other but that each i</font>

827
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,940
think properly you still has a lot of

828
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:56,580
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fair yeah it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

829
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit yeah please don't I have a I</font>

830
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,870
have a hardware component in my product

831
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">set yeah that one there's nothing about</font>

832
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:04,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten testing that works is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't</font>

833
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:08,850
scale to send hard word everybody

834
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:11,160
totally yep cool all right let's go for

835
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,889
some future thinking thought leadership

836
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,790
via the thought leader hosing and this

837
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:21,360
is where thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thought ops</font>

838
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:23,460
2017 right there this is really thoughts

839
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,168
on how do we what is future looking in

840
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,850
terms of how we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make effective</font>

841
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,880
application security programs moving

842
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,860
forward the hallmark of a modern

843
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,870
application security program is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

844
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,520
combination of this sort of continuous

845
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,280
feedback combined with continuous

846
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,710
visibility the other way to think about

847
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,120
it from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual attacker like the</font>

848
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,309
attack driven defense sort of approach

849
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,080
here is that to be successful becomes

850
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,210
too real attackers which is who we're up

851
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,678
against you need to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

852
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,870
the question how do I know when my

853
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,280
attackers are being successful right I

854
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,110
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know when my attackers are</font>

successful before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Krebs calls me</font>

through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this the three pillars</font>

859
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,330
of effective visibility and continuous

860
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,730
feedback that I've really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen be</font>

861
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,770
effective are that it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

862
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,690
detect it hackers as early as possible

863
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,009
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack chain right you don't want</font>

864
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,840
to be detecting them at exfil time

865
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,040
because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a pretty big problem</font>

866
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probably not detecting</font>

867
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,850
their full exfil or anything like that

868
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,340
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you break</font>

869
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,739
down the attack chain from the offensive

870
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,780
perspective of you know recon<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Volm</font>

871
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:33,419
discovery to payload refinement to

872
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,550
actual exploitation C&C<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

873
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,400
grabbing data and moving laterally an

874
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,840
excellent you want to now run that from

875
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,050
the defensive perspective to be able to

876
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,330
say for each of these components of the

877
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,940
attack chain how do I have the ability

878
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,560
to detect someone here and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality</font>

879
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it through</font>

880
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,920
that lens you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

881
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,180
anything here<font color="#E5E5E5"> or here or here and then</font>

882
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,920
when you start to actually take your

883
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,419
next step which is how do I start to run

884
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,310
attack simulations here whether that's

885
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,990
via<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentester bounties or attack</font>

886
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,370
simulations or anything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

887
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,200
find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area that you thought</font>

888
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you add a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visibility and you</font>

889
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,210
actually don't it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more that</font>

890
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,100
we can be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of testing our controls</font>

891
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,040
here the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective we can actually</font>

892
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,990
make them so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really into the</font>

893
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,810
second piece which is the ability to

894
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,870
test and continuously test and refine

895
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,279
your triage and your response is key you

896
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time that you're dealing</font>

897
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">with like fire drills right the first</font>

898
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,500
time that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever if the first time</font>

899
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,970
you're ever running out of the building

900
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,130
is because it's on fire like you're

901
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,109
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a really bad time but if</font>

902
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,640
you've walked out of the exit like a

903
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,260
dozen times<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you like oh that's</font>

904
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,450
where it is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually like</font>

905
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,750
this is good<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

906
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,609
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this the the beauty of</font>

907
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,340
DevOps and this is why when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to</font>

908
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning I alluded to hey I really</font>

909
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">view embracement of cloud and DevOps and</font>

910
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,640
just moving faster is actually a

911
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">net-positive on security is that it for</font>

912
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,940
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we can actually move</font>

913
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,200
faster than attackers right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

914
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,000
first time that we really had this

915
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,399
capability if you think about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

916
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,220
waterfall methodology where we released

917
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,050
every 18 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we requested servers</font>

918
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,419
from the SIS ops group and they gave

919
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,250
them to him for years later like we

920
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,870
could not move fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even if we</font>

921
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,090
detected somebody we really couldn't do

922
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,950
anything about it now with DevOps like

923
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,240
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the game out from</font>

924
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,029
under attackers and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

925
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a quote in a minute on like what</font>

926
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can actually look like successfully</font>

927
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the third bit is the ability to</font>

928
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,420
continuously test and refine your

929
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,560
incident response and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dfi r and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sec</font>

930
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,650
ops and everything like that

931
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,690
the beauty here is if you're running a

932
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,050
bounty program or a pen test or however

933
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,610
issues come up treat those as if they

934
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,590
were incidents and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're going</font>

935
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run this one this you know this</font>

936
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,680
business logic issue that just came in

937
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,600
or the sequel injection that just came

938
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,690
in we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run this as if it was</font>

939
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,759
a it wasn't reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody actually</font>

940
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,020
was exploiting us via it and let's

941
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,150
actually run this as a scenario and

942
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,700
let's say how do we know how can we

943
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,830
answer the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they did anybody</font>

944
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,020
else exploit this did that particular

945
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,420
actor exploit anything else against us

946
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,460
like has this been used has data been

947
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,480
compromised because of it and how could

948
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,460
we when we're in the middle of

949
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,020
investigating and we were like oh we

950
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to pull this data set oh that data</font>

951
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,520
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't exist how can we run that</font>

952
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,109
scenario so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better and</font>

953
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,450
better processes here where we can say

954
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm going to need this sort of data</font>

955
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,720
set for any incident like this and

956
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,370
here's how I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to be able</font>

957
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,169
to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here's who I'm going</font>

958
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need in the room I need two people</font>

959
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">from that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team two people from that team</font>

960
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,819
two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that team here's how</font>

961
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,860
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate you know in</font>

962
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,960
bandar out a band<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

963
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:46,290
that you've run before before there's a

964
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,390
real incident this was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I put</font>

965
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:52,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question there i'm on camera so</font>

966
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:54,089
i'll keep it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little vague but we've</font>

967
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,090
seen issues of seeing issues in the past

968
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,600
where had this sort of visibility in

969
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,980
place and we watched an attacker

970
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,029
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue and we know that it</font>

971
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,770
wasn't like a tool or something like

972
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,080
that we watch them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discover an issue</font>

973
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,660
and confirm exploitability of it and

974
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,640
then not use it and just go away and

975
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">never report it and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of the</font>

976
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">scariest moments my apps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that career</font>

977
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,010
actually was watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then just</font>

978
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of setting a trigger on it for six</font>

979
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,920
months we watched more like are they

980
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,170
going to show back up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font>

981
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,540
here like what why did they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw</font>

982
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,850
that and save<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for later and what is</font>

983
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,440
actually happening here and you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

984
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,569
ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of visibility</font>

985
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,310
to say hey did they find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

986
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,290
did somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else find this what's</font>

987
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,299
actually going on here i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font>

988
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:38,279
you an example from etsy just because

989
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,760
there are the times<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use</font>

990
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,310
their name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything like this but</font>

991
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,630
this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different scenario where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

992
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:47,610
can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up on that reddit thread it</font>

993
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,080
was really it was really awesome which

994
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,619
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we got to live both sides of it</font>

995
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,960
where

996
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,480
this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our at the time we</font>

997
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,240
thought attackers turned out to be an

998
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,460
awesome bounty researcher but is before

999
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,348
we had a bounty program and they they

1000
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,970
wrote up the thread and they said i

1001
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,740
discovered this issue on friday

1002
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,859
afternoon and I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to email it</font>

1003
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,328
in to them and the timing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a</font>

1004
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:11,970
little bit off but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened is that</font>

1005
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:14,460
we detected their requests and pushed a

1006
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:17,098
fix before they actually reported it to

1007
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:19,529
us so we went what happened as you read

1008
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,299
the thread<font color="#CCCCCC"> is went to you know confirm</font>

1009
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:23,160
the POC again before we emailed it in

1010
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:25,980
the next morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it wasn't working</font>

1011
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,819
anymore and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got this email from that</font>

1012
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:32,190
was like hey so I'm a white hat I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1013
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:34,499
my testing from my home IP we're not

1014
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get all lawsuit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II right and</font>

1015
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:37,618
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like no no check your check your</font>

1016
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,999
cat actually we emailed you in the

1017
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,160
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your testing and said hi there</font>

1018
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:43,140
we see you do you see anything like

1019
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,078
here's our team it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contact email</font>

1020
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,299
give us a shout and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a really cool</font>

1021
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,609
interaction there in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1022
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the success story to be thinking</font>

1023
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:54,900
the the lens of modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps sector which</font>

1024
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,460
is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get this sort of visibility</font>

1025
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,349
to know when our adversaries are

1026
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,119
actually being successful because we

1027
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:01,739
need this capability to drive it back

1028
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,059
into the development teams and the dev

1029
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:05,489
ops teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make them</font>

1030
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,299
self-sufficient so the end is actually

1031
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:11,489
near congrats you<font color="#CCCCCC"> made it this far</font>

1032
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:14,099
really the thesis of this to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put</font>

1033
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:16,829
in a different way is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old</font>

1034
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:20,099
waterfall model is this exclusive focus

1035
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:22,559
on heavy gatekeeping controls to try to

1036
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">eliminate all bugs before code is</font>

1037
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,569
deployed that's not wrong it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1038
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,970
impossible goal but i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> call bugs are</font>

1039
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:31,799
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be eliminated before code</font>

1040
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,200
go to production otherwise none of us

1041
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:36,150
would be in this room the way in which

1042
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">we actually shift our approach here is</font>

1043
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,739
to focus on obtaining and refining

1044
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,109
continuous visibility and feedback from

1045
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:45,180
deployed applications and using that to

1046
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,828
make development teams and DevOps teams

1047
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,749
and security teams security

1048
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:50,190
self-sufficient so you're awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1049
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:52,339
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here after lunch thank you so</font>

1050
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">much</font>

1051
00:40:52,839 --> 00:41:00,328
I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about yeah we have seven</font>

1052
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:05,558
minutes it looks like four questions

1053
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:09,269
please don't anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know someone's</font>

1054
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,269
got something yeah Jimmy take the mark

1055
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:19,479
great talk by the way how do you find

1056
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the intersection of kind of legacy</font>

1057
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:25,989
governing body such as PCI and what

1058
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,089
other three letter words<font color="#E5E5E5"> interacting</font>

1059
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:30,489
with this new approach to dev ops and

1060
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:32,170
security moving fast I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1061
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,239
challenging I found in the past year

1062
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moving towards this sort</font>

1063
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,009
of continuous deployment yeah even bug

1064
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:42,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">bounties are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not always easy to explain</font>

1065
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:45,009
totally at all actually pull that

1066
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,960
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for water which is talk about</font>

1067
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:49,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">it through the lens of compliance or</font>

1068
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,130
regulatory constrained environments

1069
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:54,489
right there's no magic answer to that

1070
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:57,069
one at all having lived through some of

1071
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:59,849
that it's that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give a very</font>

1072
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:03,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">high level answer here honestly is that</font>

1073
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:06,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the nice thing is that the embracement</font>

1074
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:08,979
of DevOps and cloud and see I CD and

1075
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,529
everything like that it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6</font>

1076
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:13,779
mr. internet company is doing it it is

1077
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,069
picking industry and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1078
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:17,650
find that people in there doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

1079
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:20,319
audit just kind of by definition tends

1080
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lag what the current environment</font>

1081
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,359
looks like so but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found effective</font>

1082
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:27,849
there is as you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1083
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,180
auditors or you know regulators ranting

1084
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,469
there is really they're very used to for

1085
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,629
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part I don't want to over</font>

1086
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:36,549
generalize but for the most part they're

1087
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,960
very used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven like hey here's the</font>

1088
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:40,479
item in the spreadsheet it says this

1089
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,700
like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this yes or no and the</font>

1090
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:44,710
more that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can push back to auditors</font>

1091
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,759
and say what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the underlying thing</font>

1092
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,319
that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually secure</font>

1093
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,089
here or what is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget your</font>

1094
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:50,650
question but what is the what is the

1095
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:53,319
attack that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigate</font>

1096
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,420
what is the like why do you want this

1097
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:56,920
control in place oh you want that here's

1098
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,690
how we do that different than your

1099
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,910
question here's how you exactly mitigate

1100
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,739
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like some</font>

1101
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,118
auditors that flies with some they're

1102
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,150
like nope it's this cell in the

1103
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:09,280
spreadsheet in needs to be yes or no

1104
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,540
that's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

1105
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get better overnight and I</font>

1106
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that especially in environments</font>

1107
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,460
where you can choose your<font color="#CCCCCC"> auditors</font>

1108
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,890
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you interview your auditors</font>

1109
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:19,900
who say hey I'm looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that</font>

1110
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,720
is actually trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help us meet our</font>

1111
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,980
compliance obligations and actually

1112
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,290
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet the underlying goals and</font>

1113
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:32,680
not just read off a spreadsheet please

1114
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:34,150
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sect of ops news like me are</font>

1115
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,270
there any other resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should</font>

1116
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,090
check out to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jump in probably</font>

1117
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,560
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the talks here yeah i think</font>

1118
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,720
there's that's been something that's

1119
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,820
really exciting i think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so many</font>

1120
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,859
so much cool material has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

1121
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,020
out the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple years on this of</font>

1122
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,610
kind of you know pick your smattering of

1123
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,259
a bunch of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet companies that</font>

1124
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,500
really published early on about this

1125
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:59,140
right yeah facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> at T Google squared</font>

1126
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:02,860
like Netflix all that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colon sitter</font>

1127
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropbox now you're starting to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font>

1128
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,880
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think from different</font>

1129
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:09,460
verticals as well which is really cool

1130
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,050
so you know as you're in financial

1131
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,730
services you're seeing like cloud groups

1132
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,350
spring up in financial services and

1133
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,210
everything there where four years ago

1134
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,190
they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we're financial services</font>

1135
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,570
we never<font color="#E5E5E5"> touched cloud and now you come</font>

1136
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,890

cloud but we're seeing like our<font color="#CCCCCC"> new web</font>

1139
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,360
applications for mobile applications

1140
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:30,460
tend to be in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment so that</font>

1141

answer was super<font color="#E5E5E5"> white on specifics so</font>

1144
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,700
stuff I've seen that was really cool but

1145
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,200
from a high level I think more and more

1146
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,200
is being published and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

1147
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:49,450
please yeah

1148

1150
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,440
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cutting edge companies</font>

1151
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:07,690
are doing this first<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm but if you're</font>

1152
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,520
consulting for a very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and</font>

1153
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,430
its got like ten twenty thousand

1154
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,070
developers and you're like hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wave</font>

1155
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,799
of the future is you empower your

1156
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:20,260
developers and they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push to</font>

1157
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:25,510
production whenever they want because

1158
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you trust them you'll get a very strange</font>

1159
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,910
reaction oh yeah because that in a very

1160
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">large company that culture just doesn't</font>

1161
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,569
exist of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like trusting the</font>

1162
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,670
developer and here's here's the crazy

1163
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:39,460
part and I wonder what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about</font>

1164
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:44,830
this it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different quality of</font>

1165
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:46,870
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay potentially right so the</font>

1166
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,180
people that Facebook and Netflix and

1167
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,009
riot games and all these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1168
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:54,759
they're hiring for this responsibility

1169
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">and for this trust and like they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1170
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,770
have a very high quality so what do you

1171
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,900
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the larger orbs with 20,000</font>

1172
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,850
developers hey you just need to change

1173
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,530
how you hire devs and they need to be

1174
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:08,830
higher quality and you need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

1175
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:11,920
to trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> them sure I think that what I'm</font>

1176
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:13,150
what I've seen in exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of</font>

1177
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,800
enterprise environment that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

1178
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this isn't a change that</font>

1179
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens overnight and it doesn't happen</font>

1180
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:20,980
all at once right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't happen that</font>

1181
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">fast and it doesn't happen across the</font>

1182
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,520
entire development organization what you

1183
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:27,339
see in environments like that typically

1184
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,650
is that here is that one most

1185
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward-leaning team and they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1186
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start to toe in the water with cloud</font>

1187
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,640
or dead lops or anything like that and

1188
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,200
the beauty of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1189
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,850
that's how they kind of are able to

1190
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">learn the case study of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's going</font>

1191
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,330
to work here right it's not just for all

1192
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,770
the stuff that's published it's awesome

1193
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the more that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can learn from each</font>

1194
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,950
other and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help each other out we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1195
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,990
facing the same problems like that's

1196
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,580
fantastic but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's always going to be</font>

1197
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,919
slight tweaks on how it works inside

1198
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,390
your particular organization and so what

1199
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,480
I really see what ones like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

1200
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,980
whether it's via in acquisition or just

1201
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,360
be a team that hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the one that</font>

1202
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,280
was tasked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> building the mobile app</font>

1203
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">or whatever there's always this kind of</font>

1204
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,990
one at least one forward-leaning team

1205
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,010
they start to embrace these principles

1206
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,979
first and

1207
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,800
see it flow from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> into how do we</font>

1208
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,150
now how do we now go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the second tier</font>

1209
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,200
teams or the third tier teams or

1210
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,940
anything like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the</font>

1211
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,500
lessons learned along the way if someone

1212
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,950
said oh we're going to turn a 20,000

1213
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">person deb shop to see I CD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow and</font>

1214
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,750
be like you're insane but

1215
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:44,850
I think it's I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuzzy I think</font>

1216
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,560
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I think there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1217
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:48,029
of lessons that we can learn for each

1218
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,700
organization there that say hey here's

1219
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,980
how we retrain and retool people for

1220
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,089
this sort of right this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shift in</font>

1221
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,940
the job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we make them</font>

1222
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:58,140
effective at that I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

1223
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be focused on that rather than</font>

1224
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,900
just cutting off parts of the

1225
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,060
development organizations how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1226
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,770
actually enable folks there I'm now

1227
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,990
being thrown off stage so thank you so

1228
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,550
much for everybody and dev and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emily are</font>

1229
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,870
up next and what's awesome lets the

1230
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:13,870
ground
