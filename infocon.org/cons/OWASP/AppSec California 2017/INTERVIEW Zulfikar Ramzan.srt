00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,230
kpmg we're here at apps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> California</font>

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,240
2017 right here instead of monaco by the

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,070
beach we are with Zilpha<font color="#CCCCCC"> car on sun the</font>

CTO of our essays with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car how are</font>

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,160
you are terrific<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean this is a</font>

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,890
fantastic conference fantastic venue

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,820
couldn't ask for a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> day so we'd</font>

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to hear a little bit about your</font>

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,059
recent work which you talk about in your

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,620
presentation I'm sure among many other

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,419
things you're working on but tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a</font>

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,709
little bit about your presentation today

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,450
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity and machine learning</font>

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,129
Sonia machine learning to become a

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,629
really huge buzz word in the cyber

17
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,519
security community it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,570
vendor you talk to is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

19
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,640
doing machine learning in one way shape

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,929
or form and yet it's hard for the

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,300
typical consumer of those technologies

22
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,920
or the practitioner to figure out what

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">works and what doesn't they're either</font>

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,609
movement with the vendor saying which

25
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,870
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that balanced we're trying to</font>

26
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,489
parse an academic paper without

27
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,218
understanding what it takes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

28
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,388
paper a reality so my purpose to do is

29
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,190
to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a balanced view of</font>

30
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,110
machine learning talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

31
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,970
a positive applications but some of the

32
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,080
challenges and pitfalls and really

33
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,840
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it in a more holistic</font>

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,420
context so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any takeaways for</font>

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,510
decision-makers and their implementers

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,100
right because we have you know audience

37
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,870
members may include decision makers like

38
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,070
the purchasers and then the engineers

39
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specialists on the ground who</font>

40
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,619
actually may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this I can</font>

41
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,580
imagine a message may be different for

42
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,320
each but there's definitely

43
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,570
considerations from your talk that I

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,559
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you were up there sure</font>

45
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,960
so I have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Buddha key</font>

46
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,340
takeaways the first key takeaway is the

47
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,050
machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning it's all about the data</font>

48
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine learning is garbage in garbage</font>

49
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,039
out you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw the fanciest algorithm</font>

50
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,390
on the planet but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,410
with bad data in the first place you

52
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,810
will not be able to draw a good

53
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">inferences from it so really focus on</font>

54
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,160
how your vendor or<font color="#E5E5E5"> how your equip rating</font>

55
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,020
data into your machine learning system

56
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,610
the second key takeaway is that it's

57
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">really about looking at the features</font>

58
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,490
that are looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> within that data</font>

59
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,660
context so it's not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about taking</font>

60
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,550
that and being able to analyze it

61
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,140
blindly but understanding how do you

62
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,300
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the features that are relevant for</font>

63
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,240
machine learning and put them into

64
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,590
reality and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the raas key</font>

65
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,508
takeaway is think about the metrics that

66
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,830
matter to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you typical vendors will</font>

67
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,420
produce something like a true positive

68
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,310
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> detection rate it might give you a</font>

69
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,629
false positive rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got to look</font>

70
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,250
at all the numbers to provide you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

71
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,720
but more importantly think about what

72
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,150
those numbers mean for you specifically

73
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,580
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then somebody finds a true positive</font>

74
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,120
on a little bad file that's great but if

75
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">you accidentally take a false positive</font>

76
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,030
on a file that's a critical thing for

77
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">your business that's a really bad thing</font>

78
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,000
so it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the individual</font>

79
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,920
numbers and rates but the underlying

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,750
story beneath them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you gotta look at</font>

81
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">things much more deeply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and carefully</font>

82
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,860
not just treat machine learning as a

83
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,970
panacea to solve all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problems</font>

84
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,310
there's a running<font color="#E5E5E5"> joke in our community</font>

85
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,709
that folks should not roll their own

86
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,840
crypto as it were should people based on

87
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">your observations roller own machine</font>

88
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,290
learning absolutely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really</font>

89
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,879
owned mission learning only because

90
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,560
there's so many nuances and how to

91
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,909
implement these things correctly it

92
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,980
takes someone who understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> the field</font>

93
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,048
to know when you've actually run into a

94
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">fundamental mistake and then the models</font>

95
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,260
you've produced are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

96
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,760
well in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I wouldn't try to</font>

97
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,200
roll her own but I would try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

98
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">collagen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't treat everything as</font>

99
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,958
a black box either it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

100
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,809
understanding what's inside that black

101
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,010
box and how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a deeper level</font>

102
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,209
the other thing I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about as i was</font>

103
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,280
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your presentation is that</font>

104
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,750
whatever time the decision maker has

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,159
probably put on paper for a machine

106
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning project that take place they</font>

107
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,090
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably actually no go 1.5 times</font>

108
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,920
or longer right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

109
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,260
something a that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> really well</font>

110
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,458
the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and be you</font>

111
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,780
actually need to continue devoting

112
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,160
resources to it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just the one</font>

113
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,389
and done right correct yeah you know in

114
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">our industry we're dealing with a</font>

115
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,840
sentient adversary is going to adapt all

116
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,250
the time we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set it and forget</font>

117
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,049
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hope it's going to work in a long</font>

118
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,000
term<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to fit our</font>

119
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,530
ways around what we put in place and

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,209
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta constantly adapt and readapt</font>

121
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,950
now machine learning can help with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

122
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,209
process but only if you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

123
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">process in which machine learning is</font>

124
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,989
used and not treated as a one-time<font color="#CCCCCC"> event</font>

125
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,819
so whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you spent on machine</font>

126
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,440
learning or allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it really make</font>

127
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,488
sure you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of time in</font>

128
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,349
place maybe it's one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half time</font>

129
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,150
maybe it's two times totally depends on

130
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,810
your organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again don't read</font>

131
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,669
it as something that's going to

132
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,049
magically solve your problems without

133
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:04,599
spending time understanding how the

134
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,579
magic actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so last</font>

135
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,260
question for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you is off the car what do</font>

136
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,299
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apps at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cali the venue</font>

138
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,900
mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a huge kind of absent</font>

139
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,699
general I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working in this area</font>

140
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,840
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time in different way shape</font>

141
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,000
or form I think it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

142
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,488
important problems facing our community

today most attackers break in because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>
