1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,150
well I said my department is identity

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:12,930
and access management and it's very wide

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,180
very deep very old and very emerging at

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,070
the same time and doing that in a

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,999
financial institution also involves a

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,489
lot of compliance issues regulations

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:26,549
nerves everything privacy payment

8
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:31,009
services directives regulators and so on

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,540
and so it's very very interesting topic

10
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:36,480
Martin asked me to talk specifically

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,000
about attribute based access management

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,910
and I guess most of you know the concept

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,030
who has never heard of this attribute

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,300
based access management okay only a few

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,969
people but it's the thing that four

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,780
years ago when I started at ABN AMRO was

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,359
not so common most companies had

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,600
role-based if they have role-based well

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,640
rolled out and I was giving this lecture

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,780
at the natal answer Bank venue for the

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,670
subsequent rest for sure with

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,730
architecture for security and that's how

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,110
I ended up here today four years later

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:20,670
so what I see that I had some slides

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,710
from 2014 about connectivity and that's

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,260
one of the slides I gave well it said

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,399
connectivity will become more regular

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,400
across identities either about types of

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,280
countries about datasets applications

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,410
value change continents jurisdictions

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:44,280
platforms devices clouds things services

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:47,399
and so on and what happens in 2017 we

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,070
have what we call the API Academy and as

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,130
a bank we notice that because we have to

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:57,059
make an API in our back door of the bank

36
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,020
so payment services directives providers

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,710
like PayPal and buckaroo they must be

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,330
able to operate to initiate a payment

39
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,899
through the back door of the bank

40
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:13,140
through an API and their initiative in

41
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,290
my back office they must be able through

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,798
an API to provide the customer with

43
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,019
financial data with consent of the

44
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,870
customer but it's mandatory and all

45
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,329
banks have to provide this now so that's

46
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,650
a really clear API thing in the

47
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:32,000
financial world but we all know that

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,500
it's not only in the financial world

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,010
everything is connected and it means

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
that data protection is not really done

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,569
on the application level any longer but

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,810
it's a real truth of today that the data

53
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,958
itself needs to be protected depending

54
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,870
on what source it is in who is accessing

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,299
it what type of other services from

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,480
other departments or companies or

57
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,400
jurisdictions are trying to get to the

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,159
data and then you don't get very far

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,470
with the very old concept of role-based

60
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,189
then you need to make real-time

61
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:11,010
decisions who is at your door what are

62
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,230
the attributes or context why they are

63
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,048
coming in how they are coming in and why

64
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,899
they need your data in access to your

65
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,120
transaction so that's one driver y-axis

66
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,459
Bay attribute based access management

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,840
could be very important another slide

68
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,949
from 2014

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:32,870
big data visual data discovery a lot of

70
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:35,849
job vacancies for big data analysts data

71
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,699
scientists most companies getting their

72
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,638
data or part of their business data from

73
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,940
other companies buying it or just

74
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,400
connecting that's a thing which was

75
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:52,109
emerging in 2014 and today it's already

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:57,510
the truth so the data itself has made a

77
00:03:52,109 --> 00:04:00,030
different sort of transformation as well

78
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,328
because in 2017 everybody talks about

79
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,859
artificial intelligence not just data

80
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,689
science but even building on data doing

81
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:12,180
very intelligent things with it

82
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:16,108
predictive analytics we see that in our

83
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,870
own fraud detection engine which we made

84
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,048
ourselves it has a lot of algorithms it

85
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,330
sees patterns and it knows even if you

86
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:26,729
are doing your own business on your

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,130
laptop it can recognize a pattern if

88
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,020
it's someone with a pistol at your head

89
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,550
it will know while this is not a regular

90
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,719
transaction and there will be an alert

91
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:39,840
and it will be blocked so the financial

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,810
fraud with identity thieves getting your

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,510
credentials by fishing and then trying

94
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,490
to do from their laptop some business

95
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,680
transaction they will not get there

96
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,740
because they will commit the transaction

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,350
and the payment and our fraud d'Artois

98
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,980
watchdog at the background will notice

99
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,360
that it's not you and you will be called

100
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,140
is this you or instance the Microsoft

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,780
scam he is even that we can recognize

102
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:10,260
because algorithms and predictive

103
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,619
analytics we can see hotspots where

104
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,349
crime is likely to be coming also in our

105
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,870
security operations center but problem

106
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,840
is data and data in data you can analyze

107
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,090
it but the cost is also very expensive

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,320
so the next trend we are looking at

109
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,020
we're doing that together with IBM is

110
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,140
the Watson robot you know all the

111
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,539
intelligence machine that IBM has built

112
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,789
so that can do quizzes better than any

113
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,000
human ever could that's the sort of

114
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,960
learning machine and rules that build

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,150
helped us as well to test things and we

116
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:53,039
asked IBM to test they're a partner for

117
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,599
us on their machines to c24 see where

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,930
the next crime of the next fraud is

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,490
coming also by pattern recognition so

120
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,760
it's becoming a real world it was

121
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,860
scientific or it was science fiction

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,140
let's say in 2014 but today it's really

123
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,830
happening already and machine learning

124
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,250
well the whole set all based on data so

125
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:18,060
data usage is not no longer useful for

126
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:21,800
information but it's really data driven

127
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:25,230
everything today so the data is also

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,200
having a different function now also the

129
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,500
people the the use for the data it's not

130
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,620
just information but also operations

131
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,840
decisions and even future telling that's

132
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,660
all based on the date Saturday this is a

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,510
picture from 2014 as well it's India and

134
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,610
India has a new prime minister or

135
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:49,080
premiere at that time president modi and

136
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,360
he was really a new thing in india

137
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,219
because what he did he dismissed 70

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,830
ministers from the government because

139
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,190
they were fraudulent he made a complete

140
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,950
complete company also said we need

141
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,830
digital cities and he had selected 20 of

142
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,740
them across india now if you've ever

143
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,419
been to India you think wow that's

144
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,250
really the big thing they have a lot of

145
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,710
IT people there but if you look in the

146
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,020
streets you see their electricity cables

147
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,479
everywhere and there and it's really

148
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,190
sometimes very messy I lived in India

149
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,370
for one year on behalf of one of my

150
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,660
previous banks that I worked so this was

151
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,810
interesting news for me

152
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,140
and what they do they are building a

153
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,290
toilet okay a toilet well this is just

154
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,240
one example smart cities I think we've

155
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,600
all heard by the world but India's

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,640
taking this really seriously so this is

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,010
three years later and they're doing a

158
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,229
lot of things to make it possible that

159
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,659
everyone can go to toilet and in India

160
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,540
it means something

161
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,400
we had a big first in the Netherlands of

162
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,930
someone not going to eat toilet but

163
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,359
still doing what they need to do and

164
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,890
they got a big fine and it was a female

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,860
and then there was a protest that it is

166
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,349
not so nice but in India 70 percent of

167
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,320
the people don't have sanitary options

168
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,660
so in a toilet in a toilet in India

169
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,450
probably they all have an iPhone or they

170
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,610
all have a smartphone and they have all

171
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,099
four Lord light persons they don't have

172
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,810
a bank they're unbanked but they do have

173
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,300
smartphone so if you do something smart

174
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:27,060
with an iPhone in a toilet you can serve

175
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,680
two different objects options now a lot

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,860
of other things this is a contact lens

177
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,310
that can sense from your eye drops

178
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,650
whether your need your insulin and when

179
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,650
you are diabetes this is also nuts on

180
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,770
you then we have of course the drone

181
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,340
delivery and we have the Amazon pick up

182
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,810
our order picking with robots I've seen

183
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,040
it in the harbor in Rotterdam as well

184
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,660
even AMRO is now doing a big talk with

185
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,130
blockchain where a lot of parties are

186
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,380
all not Spidey

187
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,290
fault trusting each other but they all

188
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,120
need a big transaction and if ocean

189
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,310
steamer is going to the other side and

190
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,740
it brings hundreds and thousands of

191
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,739
containers the containers are sooner

192
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,630
there that's faster to do that in 40

193
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,960
days than to do the administrative

194
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,080
process so they have to wait in all that

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,180
time people are have to pay for

196
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,720
insurance if the goods are not yet there

197
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,939
so blockchain and there's also a lot of

198
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,160
optimization in there we've been to the

199
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,800
harbour and seen all these lorries that

200
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,589
loading these ships is also largely

201
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,680
ultimate so Internet of Things processes

202
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,510
everything with data well

203
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,250
another driver why you need to look

204
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,560
different at access management and

205
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,900
protection of data now also the users

206
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,599
have changed a lot not all users have

207
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,880
changed but there used to be engineers

208
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,520
like you are really people who know what

209
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,800
they are doing and now we have different

210
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,720
populations a lot of stupid users who

211
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,990
have no idea what they're doing don't

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,010
know what's in there just just use their

213
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,440
devices they do everything and when

214
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,210
we're a bank if the customer gets a

215
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,640
problem because they gave away all their

216
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:15,060
credentials then the thing is that we

217
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,970
have to pay for it not they so that's a

218
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:23,910
very expensive thing now these are all

219
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,800
digital users and their roles have also

220
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,040
changed and one of the things about

221
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,339
identity identity things or Internet of

222
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,099
Things is that in effect this thing is

223
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,890
actually also becoming a user but it's

224
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,770
merely an agent on behalf of a human

225
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,290
person who is behind it who is servicing

226
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,930
so the type of identities that you need

227
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,060
to service when we look at payment

228
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,310
services directive to where PayPal is

229
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,380
behind the door and needs to originate

230
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,150
something in my back office it's also

231
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,160
important to know that PayPal is really

232
00:10:54,150 --> 00:11:01,100
PayPal so an organization also has a

233
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,100
user ID in a way or at least an identity

234
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:08,910
now here this is what we do at ID number

235
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,900
the life cycle of a user or identity has

236
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,810
changed it's

237
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:16,410
not just Jo Malaya as we call it joiner

238
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,939
mover lever now you're an employee who

239
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,670
joins who is moving so in other

240
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,100
departments is leaving and in that time

241
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:27,689
you have business roles and that's it

242
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:30,630
that's all no we have multiple life

243
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,210
cycle status attributes and it means

244
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,460
that yeah if you are a customer for

245
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,950
instance you have contacts you're

246
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,720
anonymous we don't know who you are but

247
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,550
you have just searched the website and

248
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,560
it's interesting to see whether you will

249
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,930
on board or not and then onboarding

250
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,119
itself is now not in the office but it's

251
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,060
digital we have a very tedious process

252
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,360
for that that we're now changing you

253
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,569
have to enter some data you have a

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,370
selfie with your passport and you upload

255
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,170
a lot of information and then there's a

256
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,290
hash mate across all this information

257
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,959
you get a code through your out-of-band

258
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,510
somewhere by your SMS then you write

259
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,210
that code on a white paper with a black

260
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,490
felt-tip then you make yourself you with

261
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,650
that code and then you have to do the

262
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,840
liveliness check that you're really not

263
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,660
a talking head but really you're

264
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,490
somebody and then we can pretty sure

265
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,260
make make sure that's you and there is

266
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,320
background verification of your passport

267
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,170
and at that time you're an onboarding

268
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,940
customer and then you get a lot of

269
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,040
checks before you can really do

270
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,440
something with your account so there's

271
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,290
also before you are becoming a customer

272
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,840
you've already had three or four status

273
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,849
to your identity and you could say that

274
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,370
maybe when you have on board it

275
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,950
digitally not through the office but

276
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,500
like the regular process that in that

277
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:55,410
case maybe you can't do the 1 million

278
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,180
dollar transactions so your

279
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,760
authorizations could be different as

280
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,359
well depending on your identity life

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,490
cycle status that's just an example now

282
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,410
when people marry where they're still

283
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,990
talking about customers alright they get

284
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:15,360
maybe a payment account together they

285
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,420
get children there's a lot of statuses

286
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,950
in your literal life and when everything

287
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,630
becomes digital that needs to be

288
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,699
reflected in your access and

289
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,279
authorizations in the trust we have in

290
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:29,849
you and the type of things you will do

291
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:36,059
as a customer so your interrelations

292
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,730
become really not just one ID but really

293
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:44,029
profiles that are going through a

294
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:46,799
certain set of phases and they are all

295
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:49,259
they all have that this could be your

296
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,629
identity each of those and a lot of data

297
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:54,419
is involved and metadata about that

298
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:58,109
information where does it come from

299
00:13:54,419 --> 00:14:01,439
is it validated data quality about the

300
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:03,720
data itself is also data so that's

301
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:06,118
something we need to look at as well now

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,699
these are a lot of attributes that could

303
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:12,239
be used to define your access manage

304
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,889
your access and for employees of course

305
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:15,929
that could be the same depending on what

306
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,519
department they are they work either in

307
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,619
their own office are they connected

308
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,569
through a VPN are they working with

309
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:24,269
their own laptop or is it the iPhone

310
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,910
they got from themselves bring your own

311
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:30,350
device that could all be attributes

312
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,850
deciding what you may or may not do and

313
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,449
that's what we are building it's a

314
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,730
penumbral we already have it but not

315
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:43,229
completely rolled out so identity

316
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,449
analytics is a way how we see that the

317
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,759
identity is used you could do role

318
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:50,789
mining in role-based that you look what

319
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,619
are the common rights or authorizations

320
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,809
that a group of people have and you say

321
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:57,059
okay all secretaries have this dais in

322
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:00,149
this and if you have something else

323
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,858
right the basic things they all got that

324
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,319
that's a role and that we call role

325
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,209
mining for identities you could also do

326
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:10,368
identity mining and again you look at a

327
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:14,729
sort of yeah data analytics in effect

328
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:16,980
well I think that this is what one

329
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,859
person could have the type of relations

330
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:25,679
or delegated authorizations one person a

331
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:27,929
natural person could have so an identity

332
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:33,419
is no longer just an access an account

333
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:35,970
number or a user account it's really a

334
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,620
profile that is morphing all the time

335
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,020
during its life

336
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,290
so he can be Christmas in the center

337
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,839
that's his basic identity and then he

338
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,870
has a relation in red that's all the

339
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,540
tasks he does for his boss he could be

340
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,089
representing his boss he could be

341
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,339
delegated by customers for that company

342
00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:01,980
he could be delegated on behalf of his

343
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:04,170
parents as a regular banker bank

344
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,950
customer he could do things for his

345
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,510
children he could do things for in

346
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,790
another relation with his boss so there

347
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,550
are many many types of act actions

348
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,310
someone can do dealing with a penumbral

349
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,410
and in real life we see this because we

350
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,050
have a lot of business lines they each

351
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,240
have their own customer relation

352
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,910
background and they maintain the

353
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,740
customer data for the data of people

354
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,660
from shell for instance yeah that's a

355
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,940
different database than the one from the

356
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,490
regular private customers traditionally

357
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,740
in banks that's separate and it's not

358
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,810
always the same in this case we're

359
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,850
building some identity relationship

360
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,250
model in the middle which is heavily

361
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,370
based on these attributes about the

362
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,720
relation of the identity that's the

363
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,890
attribute in attribute based access

364
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,290
management for customers but it's not

365
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,990
just about identity although that's a

366
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:02,339
strong point what I see as a trend is

367
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:04,829
that identity is sort of getting loose

368
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,380
from the access management we always say

369
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:11,030
identity and access management access

370
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,949
management of course needs identity but

371
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,139
what I see around me is that identity is

372
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,910
now being seen by the business as well

373
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,800
meaning that the people in the business

374
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:25,140
lines who have nothing to do with with

375
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,809
security or with IT they think that

376
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,929
identity and customer identity is now

377
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:35,309
very important stuff so identity could

378
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:37,200
be the last intimacy hook for customers

379
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,090
because if these payment service

380
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,130
providers are taking over part of the

381
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,320
business and the fintechs are coming up

382
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,780
and they have different Bank rules and

383
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,550
we have so it's easier for them to be

384
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,000
flexible and fast they don't have all

385
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,480
these 3,000 legacy systems so there

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,510
could be

387
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,820
reason why identity could be a thing

388
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,910
that because that we can still have

389
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,980
contact with the customer and one

390
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,980
example is why they made Eden they

391
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,240
started in 2014 we've been presenting to

392
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,150
the board that yes there could be a

393
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,280
reason why identity is a thing we could

394
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,530
use in other domains as well

395
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,178
Eden is the Bank ID well there are

396
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,240
examples in the on the globe and

397
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:20,220
especially Estonia that's not good thing

398
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,460
to say but they have complete coverage

399
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,030
they had it four years ago ready for the

400
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:32,370
government ID for an Bank ID that was

401
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:36,780
the national ID which is now compromised

402
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:39,178
at least the card but the this is

403
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,340
something that the business wants to

404
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,840
understand and that's really something

405
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,230
new I have been in this business for

406
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,379
about since the year 2000 for three

407
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,740
global banks and only this year last

408
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,260
year

409
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,480
it is a thing that they wants to

410
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:58,290
understand and non IT guys in there in

411
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,059
the bank so I'm happy with that so what

412
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,100
we're doing we have to consolidate all

413
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:04,230
this identity data and sort of build a

414
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,939
soft layer between all the back offices

415
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,220
where the data is maintained the

416
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,410
delegation models needs to become more

417
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,110
clear and it's almost impossible to

418
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,690
consolidate that so what's the best

419
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:19,668
thing to do that is just make sources

420
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:23,040
available label the golden sources and

421
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:25,950
be very aware what data is what the data

422
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,960
quality the metadata about your data in

423
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,080
a soft layer and then make it accessible

424
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,470
from one point and then on the other end

425
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,418
making API a real API internal API so

426
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,240
all the services in the bank that need

427
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,799
these decisions and that's what we're

428
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,540
actually doing rebuilding an internal or

429
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,490
API layer we're setting up a

430
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,440
service-oriented architecture or we

431
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,040
already have it but we've been building

432
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,169
that since 2014 and it's now really

433
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,700
becoming more and more life gradually

434
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:57,750
and there's attribute-based access

435
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:02,630
management is now you can't almost can

436
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:05,460
do without and this is what I call the

437
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,010
the 7ne that

438
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,510
could be anyone in any type of his life

439
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:15,360
cycle status from any from anonymous to

440
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,970
completely identified enrolled customer

441
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,580
or any of their relations it could be a

442
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:24,110
machine it could be even a process in

443
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,850
our service that wants to do something

444
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:29,600
there so it's not just human users

445
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,969
there's a lot of variety in between

446
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,699
devices are of course more spread the

447
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,039
time zone so you can do your 1 million

448
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,110
payments from a beam from a tree in

449
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:43,980
Vietnam on holiday now well that's maybe

450
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:46,889
a bit too much but as you see the place

451
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,679
is the time the networks the apps or the

452
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,529
device that you come from it's all in

453
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,059
constants change in there could be the

454
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,360
constellations could be different for

455
00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:00,470
every transaction that you're doing and

456
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:04,289
the seventh because these are only six

457
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,000
any requests it depends what you want to

458
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,990
do if you want to see public data no

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,429
problem

460
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,500
I don't need to do your access

461
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,460
management very strictly but there is

462
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,789
not just the context of who is doing

463
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:20,610
this now but also what do they want and

464
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:22,919
especially in banking there's easy

465
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,299
countable thing you can just count how

466
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,159
much money you know they want to

467
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:28,559
transfer of course they have more

468
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,740
activities but it's something you can

469
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,870
express in figures but with attribute

470
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,450
based access management's you can make a

471
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,639
risk rating for the context where the

472
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,960
person is doing this transaction and

473
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:46,200
combine it with the transaction risk

474
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,880
that you want to provide if you combine

475
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,220
that it becomes really complex so you

476
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,020
see there is a lot of data involved and

477
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,020
that's why we have a very big

478
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,620
architecture looked like this the blocks

479
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,379
the colored blocks are giving some

480
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,820
information on for instance the blue

481
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,399
line is authorized a how about

482
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,309
authorizations the green one is about

483
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:10,289
the asset information and watch device

484
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:12,210
or what stuff do you want to go to

485
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,250
because this is also working for

486
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,100
employees and people going to their

487
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,080
internal systems this is not used for

488
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,039
customers this is for both

489
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,678
and also yeah sessions and users and

490
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,019
identities are also managed because the

491
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,649
session is also user requesting access

492
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:34,649
to some server or service so you see

493
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:37,559
four layers on the Left the service

494
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:41,100
layer this is the data layer then this

495
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:44,789
layer for the processes the business

496
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,939
processes for the in the presentation

497
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:51,179
layer layer on the top now this is just

498
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,029
a summary of what is being done the real

499
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,309
world is a lot deeper and we also have a

500
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:58,529
very complex legacy system that we need

501
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:06,750
to come from so this was a five-year

502
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:10,019
project and we're in year three now okay

503
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,659
what do you need to do attribute based

504
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:17,179
access management or what is attribute

505
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:21,019
based access management it is something

506
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:25,230
it is real-time decision making about

507
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:28,889
authorizations including the context

508
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:31,200
risk and transaction risk so you don't

509
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:35,158
have a predefined set of authorizations

510
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,380
linked to your identity no every time

511
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,279
you come in you want something the risk

512
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,320
assessment is done based on data and of

513
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,590
course we're not calculating the

514
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:51,570
complete set all the time

515
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:56,428
no it's I think that the certain stuff

516
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:58,830
you can pre define like the limits how

517
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:01,139
much you can pin at the machine that

518
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,519
could be a very static value so you

519
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:05,309
don't need to calculate that all the

520
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,250
time or it can be half products half

521
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:11,519
calculated and you need to add one so

522
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:15,929
what do you need you need a user profile

523
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:18,000
database you need identity Federation

524
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,460
because you need a lot of identities

525
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,429
from other areas a golden sources of

526
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,889
things and identities of people from

527
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,929
other areas you need trust level

528
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:31,379
framework and that's very important a

529
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,330
trust level framework is something that

530
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,540
measures

531
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:38,090
trust or security or no

532
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,120
it measures post on the one hand it

533
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:44,030
measures the risk for the context that

534
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,290
you are in and it's then in the middle

535
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:51,500
we have a 10-step layers ten levels of

536
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:54,950
risk that connects the risk level of

537
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,770
your logon contacts with the risk level

538
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,980
of the transaction so it means if you

539
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,980
are on a very very floppy environment

540
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:06,590
which we think is very high risk your

541
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,110
authorizations can be less if you're

542
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:12,919
very secure authorizations can be high

543
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,830
and flexible access management often in

544
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:19,880
many cases in the market it means that

545
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:23,480
your authentication is step up or step

546
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,240
down that's flexible in this case the

547
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,950
authorization is also flexible so if you

548
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,420
can't authenticate because you don't

549
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,330
have the right device and stuff with you

550
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,460
then it means that we are going to lower

551
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,280
your authorizations instead of because

552
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,320
we can't step up so it's not the

553
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,530
computer says no because I didn't bring

554
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,260
my identifier for my whatever pass

555
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,910
opinion or whatever it means that yeah

556
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,450
okay you can do it but not the same

557
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:53,000
amount different transaction so a both

558
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:57,080
ends it's flexible and how is it done

559
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,770
it's done on rules rule sets and those

560
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,899
rules are stored in rule engines and

561
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:08,780
actually they are policies they're sort

562
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:12,920
of expressing the technical enforcement

563
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:15,500
rules for functional roles so if your

564
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,080
daily limit has already been exceeded

565
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,770
you can't do any more transactions today

566
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,080
that's a rule for the transaction if you

567
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,790
are a secretary and you are in the

568
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,870
office and you're working on your work

569
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:33,200
laptop you can go to your bosses file to

570
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:35,989
see the latest financials to give him

571
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,360
information or to whatever if you're at

572
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:41,450
home you can't now it sounds like you

573
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,909
need a lot of rules but we've done a

574
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,470
reference visit at no idea bank in IP

575
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,590
number looks at node a about

576
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,570
sort of their friends or as they're now

577
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:54,530
in some areas they are role models in

578
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:57,379
some areas their peers so no they are

579
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,178
bank we visited Stockholm and they have

580
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,090
already done this and they're running

581
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:06,350
role based and rule based and are doing

582
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:08,870
it with not so many rules but a lot of

583
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,449
attributes that constantly varied so the

584
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,049
variables are not the rules they're

585
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:18,140
simple but the attributes so again data

586
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:21,500
quality is important of course when you

587
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:26,299
have rules a rule can be set up by

588
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,919
someone who does the business and from

589
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:29,960
retail and they want to do marketing and

590
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,850
they want whatever and sell a lot and

591
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,100
then there's the legal guy and he says

592
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,639
no this rule can't be done because there

593
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,830
is a privacy violation so it's very easy

594
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,690
to make rules that are opposing each

595
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:46,039
other and how do I know that one rule is

596
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:50,059
undoing another rule or they are

597
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:52,158
clashing well that's easy you know

598
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,750
because they will look at the same

599
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,580
attributes they will read the same

600
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,360
attributes value if it's something about

601
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,399
daily limit below zero or above zero the

602
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,750
daily limit attribute will be involved

603
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,130
so you know that these rules are

604
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,850
touching each other and could be

605
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,830
potentially clashing now what most of

606
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,730
the software vendors doing the exact

607
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,889
amount

608
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,919
forcement with attribute based access

609
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:19,130
management terms have is the governance

610
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,770
who owns the rules how do you decide who

611
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:25,490
is able to change a rule when you have a

612
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,260
bank with 22,000 employees with hundreds

613
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,419
of business lines Lobley different

614
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,309
jurisdictions if there's a central rule

615
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,740
engine who is deciding about this and

616
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,780
that's not so easy so that's something

617
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,820
it's a governance topic of course and we

618
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,678
designed that by ourselves and you can

619
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:44,299
easily autumn eyes it because it's a

620
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,070
rule set about dealing with rules yeah

621
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,530
actually that's expressed by this

622
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:53,299
picture that's this needs a rule set as

623
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:56,059
well then we have another building block

624
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:58,549
the data classifier if you want to do

625
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,210
data protection what we want on the

626
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:01,789
level

627
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,000
of the data itself you need to know what

628
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:07,700
data is important if that's just all the

629
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,330
same yeah fine-grained access management

630
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,820
on data sets on the data layer it's not

631
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,750
so easy and we did a POC with automated

632
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,360
data classification I think there were

633
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:22,159
2,500 documents in the store and we had

634
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,399
them scanned by three or four different

635
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:30,649
tools as a POC and we looked at the

636
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:33,520
results can you guess how many what the

637
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:36,139
percentage was of correct correct

638
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,779
classification like a human would have

639
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:43,549
done anyone can mention a figure a

640
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:45,789
percentage how correct could it be 20

641
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:52,158
correct anyone else

642
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:53,990
half 1890 year it was 95 actually and

643
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,120
that's quite surprising now we were

644
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,760
looking at documents like Word documents

645
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,309
PDFs and one thing that we had to define

646
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,529
is that it's in one language only

647
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:05,480
because if you have 20 languages they

648
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:07,820
look at the semantics in the documents

649
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,940
it looks at the date of origination it

650
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,620
looks at the source data a lot of data

651
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,110
attributes that are not the data itself

652
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,500
tell a lot about the quality and about

653
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:20,539
the confidentiality once you've seen one

654
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,880
document in this template shape of the

655
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:25,669
financial report and the engine knows

656
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,620
that this is a financial report every

657
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:29,990
next thing in the same template will be

658
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,729
classified correctly as well and most of

659
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,850
the cases where the classification was

660
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:38,480
not correct on confidentiality I think

661
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,279
we had 16 parameters that was because it

662
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,799
wasn't readable well enough because the

663
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:45,049
print was not clear or the scanning

664
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,750
didn't work well so that's promising

665
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:50,139
but still I don't know how to express

666
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:54,500
but banks have a lot of data at least

667
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:56,270
that still bit work to do and I think

668
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,580
that there needs to be human

669
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,330
intervention as well to validate whether

670
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,678
yes if I did the right job token

671
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,689
management system of course a few

672
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,320
federated even if you all these types of

673
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:12,200
access authentication that could be

674
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,990
validated also from different parties

675
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,929
from different federated domains you

676
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,789
need to know what's valid and even

677
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:21,919
internally in a bank you have many types

678
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:26,149
of tokens already even for employees

679
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,080
then the session integrator that's when

680
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:30,289
you have this service-oriented

681
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,139
architecture a session is actually the

682
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:36,200
process and it is not always persistent

683
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:37,610
it could not always be the same process

684
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,190
it could be different processes through

685
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,320
different api's making a different track

686
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:45,399
through your landscape and it needs to

687
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,960
be traced and then you have service

688
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:50,768
tokens and you have a lot of complexity

689
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,500
to make sure that this session is not

690
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:56,210
hijacked by external services or so so

691
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,190
that's one of the difficult problems we

692
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,539
had to solve and in 2014 there was

693
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,570
nothing on the market we could do it

694
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:05,658
with today these things are as the API

695
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,549
economy is starting it's coming out that

696
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,200
there are some solutions for it but

697
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:10,908
that's a very difficult problem when you

698
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,870
have a service-oriented architecture and

699
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:17,539
the data is and sessions of the real

700
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:21,559
users of course connectors and

701
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:23,360
interfaces and and of course for

702
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:26,000
attributes it's very important to have

703
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,299
their data quality data management and

704
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,419
metadata and it's a penumbral we have a

705
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:34,370
dedicated data management department so

706
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:37,039
in IT there are six departments the

707
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,229
infrastructure departments held a by the

708
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,539
clouds and the managed thing the

709
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,549
services department they run things then

710
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,539
he have their developments people the

711
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:46,519
solutions people

712
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:51,080
there's the Caesar Department and then

713
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:54,740
there's also the data quality management

714
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,649
department that's a department that

715
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,649
really decides about data structures

716
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:03,139
data architecture but we also run a

717
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:05,840
really large bank wide program for data

718
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:09,260
quality and that's all about nature data

719
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,418
and I think that's yeah data-driven then

720
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,360
you need to do this so it's taken very

721
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,950
seriously and of course the rules you

722
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,959
need to educate the business on their

723
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,299
ownership they who owns what and how

724
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,850
does it work I in my experience in the

725
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:24,918
past 15 years people find it very very

726
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,760
difficult to understand role based

727
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,820
access manage

728
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,950
so this is going to be more difficult

729
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:34,490
and well how does it look

730
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:36,940
the pip pop pip pip pop ready pay maybe

731
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,830
some of you have already seen it before

732
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,230
there's an a quest access request it

733
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:45,620
goes to the policy enforcement points

734
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,540
the big the big guy at the door the

735
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:52,159
gateway then the request goes to the

736
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:56,060
policy decision points which asks from

737
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,370
the administration points the rules and

738
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,100
the policies it gets their attributes

739
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,750
from the information point and then it

740
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,659
comes back with the decision and the

741
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:09,429
enforcement point as really and forcing

742
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:14,270
the access one knows and we do that with

743
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:16,580
some thing like encryption you could

744
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:20,210
still store all the data in full clear

745
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,460
text and only and then encrypt

746
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,750
everything they can't see or you could

747
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,870
do the other way around encrypt of

748
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,980
complete data set and only decrypt

749
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,138
according to the policy enforcement

750
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,960
point that's part of the data that can

751
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,030
be seen so it means that any person with

752
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,220
attribute based access management's can

753
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,649
see only the rates are they can see in

754
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,918
this context in this role at this moment

755
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:45,830
this device and they can only see this

756
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:49,330
part of the data really on the field

757
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:53,569
lead level even part of the data field

758
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:56,719
just decided on a very moment day to the

759
00:34:53,570 --> 00:35:00,770
request take some time that is

760
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:05,089
decryption but yeah this is now quite

761
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:09,080
common now what are the features context

762
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:12,440
where rule-based fine-grained access

763
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,650
decisions real-time step-up

764
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,530
authentication when your context is not

765
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,940
safe enough step down or Thor ization if

766
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,490
you can't see into anything

767
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,610
it's far more flexible on row based

768
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,830
because it's real-time and I think that

769
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,680
the hybrid solution is the best roles

770
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,600
are very handy in the very good but they

771
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,910
can't do this fine grained stuff so you

772
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,700
could add some attribute based with it

773
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,779
so the rules are in your access

774
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,180
management system you don't need

775
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,340
every rule for accessing data level in

776
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,450
your application but you do it you

777
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,580
enforce it with the access tooling that

778
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,529
makes it very easy to change rules if

779
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,440
you have a trust level framework like we

780
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:59,370
have if your iPhone is hacked in the iOS

781
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:02,460
is compromised lovely for instance you

782
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:05,940
could I can in my tool set just bring

783
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:10,860
down the trust level for all I phones of

784
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,870
this type of make iOS I could push a

785
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,940
message to the user and I could bring

786
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,440
down the authorization level because the

787
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,420
trust level is going down for that

788
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,030
device so it's also a maintenance

789
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,040
question because that doesn't remain a

790
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,260
risk never remains the same next minute

791
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,850
it's different and but it's very easy

792
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,610
because just by changing the risk

793
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:32,250
settings or the rule trust level

794
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:39,180
settings I can change the access

795
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:40,830
enforcement ok well the data set or the

796
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:45,990
transaction or whatever you want to do

797
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:49,080
has a trust level as well and that

798
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:51,299
happens with the context as well and you

799
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,180
can immediately change your iPhone when

800
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,490
you're the implementation is the best

801
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,399
way of doing it that's why how we do it

802
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:03,120
evolve from role based to attribute

803
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:07,440
based because surprise our role is also

804
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:11,549
a rule and you can express any role in

805
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,530
the semantics as a rule or even you can

806
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,810
make it's an attribute the roll number

807
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:20,400
and then I think that that's a hybrid

808
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:23,009
situation because fully attribute based

809
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,510
yeah if you have legacy you have to roll

810
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,780
out for a complete bank it's almost

811
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,940
impossible and I think governance and

812
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,240
business involvement is the most crucial

813
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:37,230
things you look at educating the users

814
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:42,750
when you're talking in a company so this

815
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:44,970
is the summary digitization data is used

816
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,840
for not just information but also

817
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:53,279
operations decisions automated decisions

818
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:56,370
a lot of connectivity D parameterization

819
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,790
the big fortress well a lot of types of

820
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,170
platforms a lot of clouds almost every

821
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,000
big multinational has more than one

822
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,380
cloud and a lot of clouds they don't

823
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,990
know

824
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,390
real-time data our retrieval from

825
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:13,500
different sources and your own store

826
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:16,710
with to AP's api's contacts with users x

827
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,690
devices micro-services automatic

828
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,290
decision making artificial intelligent

829
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,540
um's that's the context and this is what

830
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:29,370
we do in Identity and Access Management

831
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:31,970
to sort of support this now you can read

832
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:36,450
for yourself more flexible data-driven

833
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:41,629
decisions and this is about my last

834
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,629
slide I think time for questions

835
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,380
[Applause]

836
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:35,680
yeah yeah then in in a B number Bank if

837
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:39,010
we block your credit card you will be

838
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,890
contacted you won't be just locked there

839
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,560
and there also it it this is the engine

840
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:48,910
that enables all this it's not the

841
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,830
decision how the process will be when

842
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,660
they block your credit card that's up to

843
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,960
the business but I can assure you we

844
00:39:52,660 --> 00:40:00,509
have I don't brought this slide here but

845
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:04,060
we have the access management is

846
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,860
intelligence or rule based but behind

847
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,720
the access door

848
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,720
there is the fraud engine with its

849
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,430
algorithms and its rules which is

850
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,279
already working we had a patent for that

851
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,310
in the US since four years and there

852
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,080
they look at the black side of things to

853
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,529
block you for instance for your credit

854
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,470
card

855
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:26,080
the I am engine looks at the white side

856
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:28,779
of things to make sure that you're doing

857
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:33,040
whatever you can and they are working

858
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:35,530
together so and that's a sort of gray

859
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,390
area in the middle and for credit cards

860
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,340
indeed there will be a red flag if

861
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:43,569
you're in a situation where something is

862
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:45,160
not according to the fraud detection and

863
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,110
they will contact you but it's the

864
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,859
business who decides that this is just

865
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:52,780
the engine that enables it so if this

866
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:56,110
would happen and this would be coming

867
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,180
known to someone in the business or the

868
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,710
guy who decides on these rules that's

869
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,470
why the governance on the rules should

870
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,750
be very clear then they should change

871
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,680
the rules either in the fraud engine or

872
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,680
in the I am

873
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:24,538
yeah mm-hmm

874
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:26,730
yeah actually what the another thing

875
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:29,490
that's looking at it before you

876
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,410
implement the role rule you need to test

877
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,439
it that's one of the difficult things

878
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,779
you set rules you play the rules with

879
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,900
the attributes and you know now listen

880
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:42,510
this and this will be the outcome but

881
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,890
when you think okay then you have to

882
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:48,059
change the rules and the most difficult

883
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:50,940
thing in this rule based is what rules

884
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:53,390
do I need with what attributes to get

885
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,670
this and this in this outcome so

886
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:01,020
reverse-engineer the decision that you

887
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:06,109
want yeah that's a that's yeah you can

888
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,109
talk for hours on that yeah

889
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:27,190
yeah yeah they'll push ya now 90% of the

890
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,040
business is done through the mobile

891
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,810
phone and then the business decides on

892
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,590
how their community its their customer

893
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:37,450
we're just under the surface but they

894
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,470
also asked the same question but they

895
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:43,990
can push buttons or they can push

896
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:47,439
messages to the customer to explain why

897
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:49,629
it works and what we see from all this

898
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,550
from the fraud detection and we know the

899
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:59,190
patterns of behavior of customers most

900
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:01,540
patterns are very very consistent so

901
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:03,580
there may be diversity in what they do

902
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:05,680
but most customers are pretty consistent

903
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,480
in their behavior so if they have once

904
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,029
learned that this is working like this

905
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,880
and oh maybe I can do step up and I have

906
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:15,400
built a POC a sort of mock-up demo when

907
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,810
we started this where yeah I didn't

908
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,510
bring it in because it's too much time

909
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:21,630
maybe but really you can see select your

910
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:24,910
logon methods and then you can just

911
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:29,400
present the customer with choices that's

912
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,399
yeah all about a good user interface

913
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:43,810
yeah but it's it's still your same app

914
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:47,810
on your phone and you have your own

915
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:49,910
settings there so yeah but it's all

916
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,590
about design of the interface I I agree

917
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,440
with that if that's not well done then

918
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:57,820
these problems may occur so I need to

919
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,820
educate the business also in this

920
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,900
PII data as defined by GDP are in

921
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:32,480
different variations there are two sides

922
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,780
to it one side is that security uses

923
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,630
data about your context and about you

924
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,750
which it has always done biometric data

925
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,820
for instance for authentication we're

926
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,670
not storing that and we're hashing it

927
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,430
and then making sure we're not ever

928
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:52,010
making it available or storing it on the

929
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:55,310
iPhone or sending it across or whatever

930
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:58,190
that's one side on the other side a data

931
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:02,900
classification to know what sources

932
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:05,839
what areas contain VII is very important

933
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:09,829
so this is I think that privacy being

934
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,230
privacy compliant in the usage or but

935
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,869
agreements with owners or the data

936
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,750
possessor is part of your data quality

937
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:20,300
so you need to ring-fence

938
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:23,450
the systems and the areas inside your

939
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:25,400
company that contain PII and that's how

940
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:27,910
we do it through this data quality

941
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,910
Department
