1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,940
good what I want to present today in

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,369
this talk is actually some reporting on

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,539
research analysis we have been doing on

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,119
domain names that have been registered

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,980
on the dot EU TLD so we have actually

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:21,120
been analyzing all the registrations in

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,640
dot EU I'm actually trying to understand

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,320
how large bunches of malicious domain

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,660
names are being registered by malicious

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,369
actors and the work at present today

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,039
here is joint work between a research

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,750
lab at k-11 and also here it which is

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,700
the registry for dot EU so together

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,210
actually we did this analysis we go into

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,680
the insights that you can present today

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,670
how will the talk look like I will first

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,800
start with a little bit of research

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,960
context what do we exactly mean with

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,970
malicious domain names how do you ACTU

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,980
actually work what is the main idea what

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,649
do we actually want to research in this

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,940
analysis let me go a little bit deeper

23
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,100
into the data set that we have been

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,269
using and during the analysis the

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,540
malicious domain names that we actually

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,460
found in the dot au TLB and then I will

27
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,649
show you some of the insights we found

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,069
in on the doodle analysis we studied the

29
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:09,689
domain names from 14 months long those

30
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,579
insights was actually trying to

31
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,708
understand how the malicious actors work

32
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,479
and more important if you understand how

33
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,130
they work can we actually make it nice

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,020
order for them can we actually make it

35
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,509
much harder for them to register domain

36
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,039
names and the last two parts in that the

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,719
presentation will be rather short they

38
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,039
were actually looking forward if you now

39
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,499
did all that work of doing the manual

40
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:30,420
analysis how can we automate this to do

41
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:32,969
this on a more regular timeframe but

42
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,649
also on more TL DS and secondly if you

43
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,689
have all the information available how

44
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,819
attack will actually work maybe it takes

45
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,678
the time to take the next step how can

46
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,569
we actually prevent or detect this as

47
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:45,539
close as possible to the registration

48
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,359
time but first a little bit of context

49
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,310
so what are those malicious domain names

50
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,839
well most of you here already very

51
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,539
familiar with the fact that domain names

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,340
or key factor in Internet and also for

53
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,709
attackers they're actually using this as

54
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,779
kind of an enabler to launch our attacks

55
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,909
for spam they need domains to send

56
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:04,529
domains for their mails from to

57
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,569
communicate with a command and control

58
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:08,609
and botnets they need domain names

59
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,590
because they are actually much easier to

60
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,750
replace or to update than fixed IP

61
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,270
addresses same for fishing and for more

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,990
aware and the trend that we see recently

63
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,530
we

64
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,000
in the malleus community is that they

65
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,130
actually trying to avoid blacklisting

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
they're trying to be much more than hit

67
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,400
and run strategy so they actually using

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,990
in the main name and then they disperse

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,060
it they go to the next domain name

70
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,500
because once it's blacklist you can't do

71
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,910
anything with the domain name most of

72
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,560
the mail service will book it and so on

73
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,420
so you see that there's actually a very

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,210
fast flux and the use of the main names

75
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,269
for one particular attack and it's a

76
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,700
single-shot after study in 2013 over

77
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,470
these shows 60% of the malicious domain

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,390
names after one day is not used anymore

79
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,190
so you just use it for less than one day

80
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,100
you throw it away and you go to the next

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,320
domain name so that's the ID but if that

82
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,359
is the context we're working in one of

83
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,010
the richest hypothesis we had is if

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,450
malicious actors need so many domain

85
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,519
names well they actually need to

86
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,260
register domain names in bulk because

87
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,240
they need for a longer period of time a

88
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,799
continuous stream of new fresh domain

89
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,250
names that they can use for abusive

90
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,960
measures maybe that is the hypothesis we

91
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,850
can actually validate that but also we

92
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,610
can actually search one step further are

93
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,680
we able to identify such bold behavior

94
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,540
in registrations based on certain

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,650
commonalities common patterns that we

96
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,530
see between those malicious

97
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,300
registrations as I already set the long

98
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,770
term goal if you have such patterns if

99
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,870
you understand how that registration

100
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,640
process is working then maybe we can I

101
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,260
go one step further and detect and

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,149
prevent them before they do any

103
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,269
malicious harm or any harm and our

104
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,470
systems that's the main idea of this

105
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,300
presentation of course in order to do

106
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,800
such analysis we need data we need to

107
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,060
actually see the registration data we

108
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,670
need to actually be searching for

109
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,950
patterns in that data set so this

110
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,679
correlation between this net and arid

111
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,250
dot-eu is it actually run by error to

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,500
the registry

113
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,630
it's a seventh largest country code TLD

114
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,760
that we have they have about I would say

115
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,710
four million domain names now in their

116
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,560
data set and the data set that we have

117
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,030
been using in our analysis is only

118
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,800
domain names that were for the first

119
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,050
time registered so if the main name is

120
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,760
transferred or re-regulate we did not

121
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,430
take that into account in our analysis

122
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,269
but in our analysis during 14 months we

123
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,770
had 800 24,000 registrations about 2.5

124
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,080
percent of them were flagged as

125
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,760
malicious by external parties so this is

126
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,109
the data set we were working on all the

127
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,330
graphs and so all the figures you will

128
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,900
see today obey

129
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,310
on this data set what information did we

130
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,710
have available of course the basic

131
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,479
information about the domain name also

132
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,080
which register has been used went

133
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,139
already registered very normal of course

134
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,198
we also have as part of our process

135
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,659
information about the registrant who is

136
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,639
actually registering this domain name we

137
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:54,770
have a company name name the language

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,349
being used the email address phone even

139
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,530
a personal address the main idea of

140
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:03,050
doing registrations in the dot EU TLD is

141
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,460
you need to provide correct contact

142
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,949
information in order to register a

143
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,299
domain name of course you also need some

144
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,289
technical details to actually operate

145
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,699
with you don't know my name

146
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,590
so also named self informations

147
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,550
available and if you are using name

148
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,619
service within your own domain

149
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,539
you also need glue records IP addresses

150
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,699
but actually boots said the whole way of

151
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,080
actually looking at your name server so

152
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,879
this is the information that we got

153
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,090
available by actually collaborating

154
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,639
together with eret little au registry we

155
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,799
did enrich that data set with two parts

156
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,789
first we went to want to know which of

157
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,860
those domain names are actually

158
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,840
malicious because we can see eight

159
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,129
hundred thousand domain names we need to

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,560
know which are the ones that work they

161
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,419
are interested in your analysis and for

162
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,090
that we actually queried three sources

163
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,900
of malicious behavior the black lists we

164
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,560
used Spamhaus

165
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,508
we also create sure and we also use the

166
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,729
Google Safe Browsing list and we did

167
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:55,009
this typically on a daily basis for 13

168
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,279
days and then every week repeated until

169
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,110
six months after registration this is

170
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,389
one part now we know which domain names

171
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,789
in our data set or malicious the second

172
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,800
thing is we also wanted to see where the

173
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,639
name servers are located so we wanted to

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,589
have actually the geolocation

175
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,449
information of the name servers and

176
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:12,770
their field we use the next month

177
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,599
free database to look up the name

178
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,250
service at the time of registration ok

179
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,628
now we have all the components we know

180
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,069
which data should be using all their

181
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,330
instance that we have been mating we

182
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:25,219
know what we actually want to search for

183
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,639
now it's time to actually go and look

184
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:30,529
and at longer tweedle analysis but first

185
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
let me introduce you the concept of a

186
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,639
campaign so campaign is a set of

187
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,219
registrations that are registered with

188
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,020
malicious intent there's most probably

189
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,699
from the same actor so the same

190
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,830
organization the same team the same

191
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,310
person and now typically register over

192
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,080
longer

193
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,910
period of time so this correlates with

194
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,380
the hypothesis we had they'll being

195
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,980
registered in bulk over a longer period

196
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,380
of time of course within a dataset we

197
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,760
actually have to query data so for us

198
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,770
our approximation is something that we

199
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,870
can money we'll select based on a common

200
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,000
pattern in our data set and that runs

201
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,250
for a longer period of time and the

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,690
common pattern is linkable - it's the

203
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,010
same actor of the same team doing it

204
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,540
because they're using the same contact

205
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,640
information they have the same pattern

206
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,120
devils using the same tools to actually

207
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,800
create registrant information of course

208
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,300
this is all vague maybe let's look a

209
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,670
little bit deeper in one particular

210
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,890
example of a campaign

211
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,470
this is campaign c11 you will see

212
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,210
numbers later on and campaigns but this

213
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,310
campaign was running for about eight

214
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,979
months from June to February and

215
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,840
consists about twelve hundred domain

216
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,490
names that were actually flagged by

217
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,109
external parties so we did not say that

218
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,270
there are bunches external party was

219
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,130
saying that those were malicious how did

220
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,870
it look well mainly look to the

221
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,890
registration information that was used

222
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,590
the contact information of the

223
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:49,400
registrant they were all using the same

224
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,409
fixed email provider namely a private

225
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,070
domain name used for email communication

226
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,650
they had in that domain name two email

227
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,360
accounts three phone numbers and two

228
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,010
streets and I were using that them

229
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,560
separately registering but they're

230
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,300
actually combining the same emails phone

231
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,790
numbers and streets over and over to

232
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,740
create new registrant information they

233
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,720
also used four registers back to back

234
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,580
so actually sequentially over those

235
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,620
eight months time they used four

236
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,270
different registers to actually provide

237
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,680
them the services to register domain

238
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,840
names in the registry so you see already

239
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,160
quite a lot registrations for one

240
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,349
particular campaign so we actually

241
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,570
assume that this is all from one actor

242
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,370
if you're looking a little bit more to

243
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,840
the different campaigns this is the

244
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,450
overview that actually sketches a

245
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,160
highlight on what did we investigate so

246
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,070
we have the full period of 14 months

247
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,510
here we have 20 different campaigns so

248
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,960
this is or 20 different so actually

249
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,610
criteria that we used to isolate regular

250
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,160
set of registrations potentially coming

251
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,030
from the same actor we see some of them

252
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,480
are actually going up to 2000 registries

253
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,209
some of them are only about 100 120

254
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,790
registrations

255
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:01,709
and the the size of the bullets on the

256
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,660
line or actually the sizes of how many

257
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,089
oh and tens was that campaign on day by

258
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,368
day basis and you see it goes up to four

259
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,999
hundred registrations that one day one

260
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:15,149
campaign can deliver so some of them are

261
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:17,040
a little bit more on strict days some of

262
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,929
them have a very strict pattern that are

263
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,599
doing it on a very regular basis over a

264
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:23,490
longer period of time so this is the

265
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,869
base ID but of course this is just the

266
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,819
graph that we say this is the end result

267
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:28,679
let's now go and to look a little bit

268
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:31,050
deeper and what we actually found us not

269
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,720
interesting insights in those campaigns

270
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,170
but first let me recap how we actually

271
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,699
did that campaign identification process

272
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:42,540
because it helps to understand how we

273
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:44,248
came to the concept of campaigns so in

274
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,319
order to actually do that this is a more

275
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,639
iterative process we typically start

276
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,410
from all the munches domains that we

277
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,959
have our data set but there of course

278
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,939
you have like 21,000 domain names where

279
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,618
do you start looking at to find certain

280
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:58,040
selection criteria that actually can

281
00:09:55,619 --> 00:10:00,179
link similar registrations to each other

282
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,649
well we have different tactics that we

283
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,929
have been using for instance you can

284
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,059
look two days that are very intensive it

285
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:09,990
publishes in registrations you couldn't

286
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:12,360
look to registration details or reused

287
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,399
quite a lot princes one mail provider or

288
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,559
one street or one email this is actually

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,290
being used in a lot of email accusations

290
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,569
over time then that's a good point

291
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,920
you could also look to registrations

292
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:24,540
that have recognized or patents for

293
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,118
instance we found email addresses with

294
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,860
very distinct patterns like this one as

295
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:31,529
a kind of a number and then a certain

296
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,220
mail provider and you also see the

297
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:37,649
frequent combination of two illogical

298
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,209
combinations of legislation for instance

299
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,189
a certain country and a certain mail

300
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:44,160
provider that only appears within the

301
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:46,139
magis registration data set and we then

302
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,279
apply this on the benign and the

303
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:52,410
malicious data data parts and try to see

304
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,420
which of those criteria do fit well and

305
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,279
the malicious set and do not pop up a

306
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,599
lot of results in the benign set because

307
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,399
that's the kind of grid of identifiers

308
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:05,149
it's really a good precise at indicator

309
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,149
for malicious traffic yeah

310
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:17,480
we will do that we'll discuss this later

311
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:20,660
but this isn't it no no here is it's

312
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,639
just if it's one a 50/50 or 60/40 it's a

313
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,290
really good indicator if you see that if

314
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,209
you apply to the militias it's only

315
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,310
giving a fraction of 2% it's actually

316
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,930
10% fraction in the benign then it might

317
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,699
not be such a good selector but we'll

318
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,620
discuss a little bit later on the the

319
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:37,310
way we can actually extend blacklist but

320
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,959
that's a good point so to give you the

321
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,388
example here we see the graph which

322
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,189
actually shows you the relative number

323
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,290
of registrations on a daily basis so you

324
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,639
see that this is the malicious number we

325
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,439
have the same graphs for the the benign

326
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,180
numbers with the malicious number have

327
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,350
actually spikes in traffic but they

328
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,029
actually have days where a lot of

329
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,130
malicious registrations have been

330
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,630
registered and those are good starting

331
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,910
points for instance for your analysis

332
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,139
or in those days there is it is there

333
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,329
any build behavior there where you see

334
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:05,360
for instance 100 of 200 stations or

335
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:06,888
using the same domain name or a mail

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,160
provider or using the same phone number

337
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,079
and so on this is one indicator another

338
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,569
indicator for instance if you say we

339
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,388
have all the malicious email providers

340
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:18,800
set up here we have countries what are

341
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,649
the hot spots of combinations of

342
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,139
countries and mail providers this is the

343
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:26,060
data on the multiset with the threshold

344
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,610
of you need more than 50 registrations

345
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,199
per dot we could do the same with the

346
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,850
benign and then see are there any hot

347
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,589
spots that are actually present in the

348
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,509
malicious set which are not present in

349
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,339
the benign set might be a good starting

350
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,560
point as well and for instance we could

351
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,060
start already with weak points in our

352
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,399
analysis we actually found out that all

353
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,829
the green points belong to campaigns and

354
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,300
the red dots do not belong to campaign

355
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:50,239
so this is actually a good conditioner

356
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:54,800
that those hot spots or a good way to

357
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,630
start to identify the campaigns of

358
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,579
course it's all kind of practically to

359
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,439
iteratively look into a filter data

360
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,459
within the dataset what's more

361
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:03,199
interesting for this audience is

362
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,689
actually if you looked in 20 campaigns

363
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,279
what type of criteria did we use in

364
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:09,349
selection criteria to select this is

365
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,319
this particular campaign so we see that

366
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,519
we're using domain name the register in

367
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,740
the name selves in some of the

368
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,180
registrations but most of the the

369
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,699
campaigns were actually selected based

370
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,430
on data used for the registrant which

371
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,800
name which address which email account

372
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,589
which email provider and those are the

373
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,780
ones that

374
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:31,700
have the most impact in selecting the

375
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:34,980
right campaigns out of the full dataset

376
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,600
good any questions so far before we go

377
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:46,010
into the insights what we found within

378
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:46,010
the campaign's yeah

379
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,269
okay let me reinsert that question after

380
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,420
the first inside because that might

381
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:08,100
actually be good nothing to answer that

382
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,959
what we used here is a full post factum

383
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,189
analysis so we actually have the data we

384
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,689
waited for a few months and then we

385
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:13,230
started the analysis of course then

386
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:15,149
we're looking

387
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,829
when was that know my name being listed

388
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:21,559
on a blacklist and that's actually dead

389
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:21,559
answer there any other questions

390
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,950
the question was why did you get the

391
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,240
data from two sources the registration

392
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,709
data was in the collaboration together

393
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,149
with earth we actually investigated the

394
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,250
data directly all the contact

395
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,470
information so on for the maliciousness

396
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,630
we actually quite the treat sources so

397
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,970
for spam house and sure we send out a

398
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,410
lot of DNS queries to query whether the

399
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,540
main name was in their list of blacklist

400
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,370
sir a blacklist domains and Google Safe

401
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,469
Browsing has an API to query so that's

402
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,120
actually the source we did not use for

403
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,860
instance let's encrypt or transparency

404
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,390
or other sources who actually enrich it

405
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,860
it could be interesting to see if you

406
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,600
enrich that how actually would that

407
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,220
change our analysis of could we find

408
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:13,240
additional campaigns but we did not do

409
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:14,170
that we respect to three providers no we

410
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,670
don't publish them because they're

411
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,649
actually containing personal information

412
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,060
personal identifiable information but

413
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,560
that is actually together with earth we

414
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:27,329
did actually search queries on that

415
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:30,339
database yeah indeed it's collaboration

416
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,750
so to answer the question when not

417
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,700
actually does the meaning is being used

418
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,770
I will transfer a little bit differently

419
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,020
how long did it take before domain name

420
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,449
and Interpol and blacklist and actually

421
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,069
we see here that there's a small window

422
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,980
opportunity once it's on the blacklist

423
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,170
yeah actually there's almost no use for

424
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,240
malicious that then intent possible

425
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,439
anymore so it's actually the moment

426
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,740
you're getting in there it's game over

427
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,480
and we see in a graph that around 75% of

428
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,880
the domain names is already flagged by

429
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,579
black his services of the five days and

430
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,079
after 30 days of registration then 98%

431
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,630
of them are already on the blacklist

432
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,670
and later on we only see two percent

433
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,839
being added to that blacklist service so

434
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,329
in that sense when are they used

435
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,100
typically in a window between zero and

436
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:13,779
five days I would say so which is

437
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,339
actually quite short not necessary the

438
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:17,410
day itself but typically in a short

439
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,380
frame so you might imagine that there

440
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,660
might even be an underground activity

441
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,010
that people are creating no main aims

442
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,680
and then selling them to malicious

443
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,590
actors that the hypothesis that we have

444
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,729
in the way the ecosystem is working

445
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:37,650
so yeah so the delay is because we only

446
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,650
see the data after a some period of time

447
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,860
well we see that even certain of the the

448
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,360
command and control domain names already

449
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,430
in use before the domain name gets

450
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,470
registered so for certain types it is

451
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,390
there the the fact that to be a little

452
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,740
bit later in the game here is because it

453
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,360
takes some time before we actually can

454
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,890
start querying the database so we don't

455
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,320
do it instantly whenever we get a domain

456
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:59,040
name is typically a 6 to 24 hour delay

457
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:04,480
and that's actually popping up there

458
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:08,109
also yes it's almost a nice later slides

459
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,150
but yes we have to give you an ID we are

460
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,979
performing I think 700,000 DNS queries

461
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,230
they to actually get that malicious

462
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,420
activity data so we're doing quite some

463
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,170
doing it more intense would be of peace

464
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,520
but this moment second thing where do

465
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,839
the data come from so I already

466
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,430
mentioned that we have three providers

467
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,708
but what actually is the data that we

468
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,070
see for what other campaigns being used

469
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:32,050
we see these are the typical Buse types

470
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,050
we see the majority of them or actually

471
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,480
being for spam so it's also quite

472
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,250
obvious that for spam there's much more

473
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,780
reporting the moment you get spam in

474
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,010
there you can report you can collect you

475
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,200
can see the four different mail service

476
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,179
domains get blacklist or commanding

477
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,640
control it's much more difficult to get

478
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,870
the whole hold on how many domain names

479
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
are being used for command and control

480
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,699
so in that sense I think the other

481
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,320
numbers that might be muscle more domain

482
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,420
names in a registration data set that

483
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,010
are used for multi activity but since

484
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,390
they are not arriving on blacklist we

485
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,110
don't have them in order malicious data

486
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:07,030
set second insight which of the domain

487
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,560
names which all the providers is be used

488
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,020
for blacklisting and which were actually

489
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,530
interesting well we see between the

490
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,280
Spamhaus

491
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,889
and sir that there's actually a good I

492
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,600
would say coverage by pulling them

493
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,210
together we see certain the campaign's

494
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,129
were only detected by one of those and

495
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,690
for others actually they're actually

496
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,000
finding the complement of each other

497
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,030
which means we actually need multiple

498
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,250
sources to get a good ground truth also

499
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,060
interesting fact if you're looking to

500
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,590
the last column the Google Safe Browsing

501
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,060
less than 2% of the domain names that we

502
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,370
actually consider you know how much the

503
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,179
data set came from Google browsing might

504
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,800
also be late

505
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,810
to the fact that the main names here or

506
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,580
more info structural and rated to spam

507
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,889
and there's always reported within the

508
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,480
browser again it depends on which are

509
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,890
the use cases that you're looking for so

510
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,350
in that sense when I'm talking about

511
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,690
malicious campaigns keep in mind it's

512
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:04,000
mainly what is being used for spam and

513
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:05,710
phishing good I already showed you the

514
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,840
graph and if you looked at the graph you

515
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,240
might already see with the 20 campaigns

516
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,280
certain things are popping up you see

517
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,590
some interesting things that already in

518
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,110
there and the first thing is there might

519
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,179
be actually a large variety in the way

520
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,550
campaigns are running so for instance

521
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,610
here we have a very smart campaign it's

522
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,590
only 37 days but it's quite intensive it

523
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,459
already has about 2,000 registrations in

524
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,689
those 37 days at the same moment we also

525
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,270
see within our data set that our

526
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,700
campaigns running over about 300 days

527
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,760
reusing registrant information and only

528
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,740
having 154 registrations so it's not

529
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,740
that all the actors are actually abusing

530
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,840
or registering the same boat number of

531
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,380
domain names with the same tools with

532
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,929
the same intensity another interesting

533
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,660
inside that we had is it seemed that the

534
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,430
malicious actors or humans as well in

535
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,620
the graph that they found here we're

536
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,540
putting the order of the day either

537
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,750
there at the moment that registration

538
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,879
has been done over day by day basis and

539
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,470
you see the the greenish blue line is

540
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,450
actually the benign registrations and

541
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,060
their daily share and you see they're

542
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,550
all more registrations during the week

543
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,720
LS in the weekend button you're looking

544
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,760
to the malicious registration we see

545
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,710
that despite so much order so you see

546
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,330
almost no registrations during the

547
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,340
weekend and most of the military good

548
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,790
stationing or happening during the week

549
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,100
of course we can't say that this is

550
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:33,159
purely because the match is actus or

551
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,560
working on business hours it it could be

552
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,450
we can only make hypotheses about this

553
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,970
another hypothesis could also be it is

554
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,640
much more interesting for them to mimic

555
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,500
the office hours because then actually

556
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,180
might go a little bit more under radar

557
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,100
if they would do all the registrations

558
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,780
on a continuous basis they would

559
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,939
actually the differentiate versus the

560
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,649
benign traffic but maybe they did that

561
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,090
they just overdid it

562
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,140
they're doing too much okay station

563
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,740
through the week first of the weekend

564
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,330
but we

565
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:03,280
such a pattern okay we can't make a

566
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,210
conclusive answer why this but more

567
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,860
interesting if you're looking through

568
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,570
the time of the year so we're doing the

569
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,159
same analysis for the full period of

570
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,500
time 14 months

571
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,360
is only the malicious traffic you know

572
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,480
again we see that it's like a summer

573
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,928
break a Christmas break and a spring

574
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,670
break I'm not sure what are they

575
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,010
actually taking holiday I hope they do

576
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,990
because it's from that time happy to

577
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,540
make a holiday but could also be that is

578
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,520
because they want to be as effective as

579
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,990
possible it could be if they're at lunch

580
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,360
you can use spam campaign during the

581
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,010
summer break that they actually has less

582
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,770
effect than doing the same spank

583
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,080
campaign in June or August so also there

584
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,150
we might see the pattern but we're not

585
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,740
sure if it's actually a fact that they

586
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,120
are actually taking a holiday or the

587
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:52,360
fact that actually trying to make it as

588
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:54,428
most effective as possible we saw

589
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,000
certain topics for instance on May 1st

590
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:59,740
and so on small spikes before and after

591
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,170
but also you have to take into account

592
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,240
therefore the one days they could also

593
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,040
be certain effects at the resource or

594
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,230
registers because they're using the

595
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,000
normal ecosystem to register domain

596
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,650
names it could be a spike on Black

597
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,420
Friday could be because one of the

598
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,370
resources are just giving them very very

599
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,380
cheap domain names so in that sense we

600
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,969
didn't derive in too much deeper than

601
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,860
the weak pattern that big pattern was

602
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,510
continued over the whole year though the

603
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,360
Year pattern we can see if you dive in

604
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,220
deeper details there are so many effects

605
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,229
that you have not under control that can

606
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,200
influence the data but but indeed that

607
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,840
could be effects there as well but a

608
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,610
little bit more about the business hours

609
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,620
we try to actually see at what time of

610
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,659
the day did they register and that's not

611
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,790
for all the campaigns but some campaigns

612
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,580
have actually quite distinct patterns

613
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,649
for instance let's look at see 18 18 18

614
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,260
we see that they're typically working in

615
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,520
box from 8 to 10 hours it's not that I'm

616
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,530
working continuously they're doing it

617
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,129
slow but all the domain registration has

618
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,320
always done in a kind of period of time

619
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,540
interesting again is mimicking or is it

620
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,950
actually that normal behavior we can't

621
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:08,860
actually know for sure yeah it's also

622
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:12,780
time zone shifts that's true

623
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:19,169
I actually think it's through the West

624
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:21,549
because there later in our time zone and

625
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,980
could also be that they're just lazy and

626
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,340
also only get up late at the morning and

627
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,620
so on

628
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,389
not sure but again we only see the data

629
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,559
we don't see the person after data it

630
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,900
would be interesting to see the one

631
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,678
behind the data more interesting on the

632
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,970
C 11 we see a morning and an afternoon

633
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,600
do they actually take lunch breaks of

634
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,740
about two hours it is quite long again

635
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,750
we don't know for sure

636
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,490
we only see that certain campaigns or

637
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,169
actually reflecting certain behavior

638
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:52,000
that we did not expect when we started

639
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:54,340
this analysis but but be reassured we

640
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,870
think about automation some others do

641
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,030
think about automation as well so here

642
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,580
we see campaign that is doing kind of

643
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,590
not so intensive campaign only few

644
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,178
registrations per day but it's always

645
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,340
doing it at the same hours and it's

646
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:09,070
actually doing it from January almost

647
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,840
two times a day and if you even mind

648
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,668
this European summer time this is at all

649
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,230
side that all system was just changing

650
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,580
through the summer time but you see

651
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,890
there are actually most of their

652
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,149
activity is always on the same time it's

653
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,309
just a chrome type or anything else

654
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,740
running on this system so not all of

655
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,840
them are working according to office

656
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,660
hours not all of them or just human

657
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,520
typing in things I didn't put it in the

658
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,559
presentation but one of the interesting

659
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,049
things we found actually typing mistakes

660
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,389
in registering deformation domain names

661
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,320
and so on so it might actually be that

662
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,390
they have a list of things that they

663
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,250
have to pull and it's easier and cheaper

664
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:47,140
to type it in and automate so now the

665
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,610
question is who is doing all that stuff

666
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,919
who is actually registering all those

667
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,469
domain names or who is facilitating that

668
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,360
so the first thing that we looked at is

669
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,950
what the register is actually enabling

670
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,379
them and we saw for instance register 5

671
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,750
we of course obviously anonymized this

672
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,730
register is actually responsible for 50%

673
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,100
of all the malicious domain names in our

674
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:12,640
data set which is kind of interesting is

675
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,928
that register of bat intent not sure it

676
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,330
could be that he's actually the cheapest

677
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,669
one and that the the malicious actors

678
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,530
are just being very cost effective in

679
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:22,300
reducing their their main names it could

680
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,720
also be because the whole ecosystem of

681
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,908
DNS

682
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,530
working with registrar's and resells I

683
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:29,140
thought a lot of results have actually

684
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,460
good contacts with this registrar or you

685
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,470
can pay in Bitcoin so they can many

686
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,809
different reasons but we see that this

687
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,360
one is popping out also their toxicity

688
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,799
actually means that more than one-third

689
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,658
of the domains that that register is

690
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,850
registering we already know for sure it

691
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:47,409
will be malicious remember the average

692
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:49,418
was 2.5 let's look at the domain names

693
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,280
well that email provides the domain

694
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:53,350
names of the email providers so of

695
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,110
course we see here in the top tree the

696
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,840
free public email providers that we can

697
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,969
use we see Gmail and AOL for instance is

698
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,149
interesting to compare we see that Gmail

699
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,220
has like 20% of the contact information

700
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,710
used for malicious domain names as a

701
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,909
gmail address about 10% has an a well

702
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:15,520
address interesting here Gmail if we

703
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:18,309
look into the toxicity only have 2% so

704
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,389
Gmail's are more likely used in benign

705
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,600
registration and in malicious

706
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,669
registrations whereas if you look to AOL

707
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,799
if you do a new registration with an AOL

708
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:28,780
address well our system will probably

709
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,030
already give you a red flag just because

710
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,980
of your email address keep that in mind

711
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,510
we see that almost half of the

712
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,370
registrations done with an AWOL address

713
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,070
in recent information is just malicious

714
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:42,070
in our data set

715
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:44,080
and the third thing I want to focus in

716
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,200
here in the top enables so these are

717
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,299
fixed email addresses used by attackers

718
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,750
if you just take the top three email

719
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:53,770
addresses used by registrants in the the

720
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,289
registration database

721
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,520
they already account for around 70

722
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,480
percent of all the malicious

723
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,000
registrations that we have in our

724
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,679
database and also interesting here we

725
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,650
see for instance the first and the third

726
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,330
email address is close to 100% toxicity

727
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,490
actually means that whatever they're

728
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:13,449
registered with I'm sure it's actually

729
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,919
with malicious intent well those are the

730
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,620
things that are not flagged on external

731
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,419
services but we can actually assume that

732
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,189
the error or test before they starting

733
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:24,400
to run or certain domains are not used

734
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:28,600
or not seen by the blacklist services or

735
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,220
reported to coming back on the the idea

736
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,469
of we have campaigns here we have

737
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,380
blacklist they do not exactly match one

738
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,690
on one here we actually try to to see if

739
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,330
you say we have about 20

740
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,490
thousand domain names that are in the

741
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,409
set of blacklisted data we also have

742
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,690
about twenty twenty-one percent of the

743
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:48,330
main names that are campaigns we see

744
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,980
60,000 of them or shared so that means

745
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,419
that if you say it's a part of a

746
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,730
campaign it's also being flagged

747
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,170
externally we were interesting to see

748
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,120
what what is actually happening in those

749
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,830
campaigns they are using the same

750
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,270
campaign criteria as the wounded are

751
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,790
being flagged but they are not flagged

752
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,220
so we did actually do a manual analysis

753
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,540
of those about four thousand domains you

754
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,210
see whether those domain names were

755
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,550
actually malicious intent or mistakes on

756
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,140
our site were false positives and our

757
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,120
conclusion is there that less than one

758
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,280
percent of them are false positives so

759
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,310
in that whole set about two hundred of

760
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,410
the domain names or actually potentially

761
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,850
benign we don't know for sure that all

762
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,730
the rest we actually could validate but

763
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,320
ever used for malicious intent that

764
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,480
actually means if you are using this

765
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,159
kind of analysis techniques there is

766
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,840
actually the potential to extend the

767
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,880
existing blacklist services with an

768
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,919
additional about 20% of extra

769
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,820
information which might be nice just

770
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,850
because of looking through the

771
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,129
registrant information on a domain name

772
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,469
and the last insight I would like to

773
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,170
discuss today is the fact that attackers

774
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,700
they are clever as well they adapt over

775
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,170
time so I already mentioned the

776
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,790
beginning that they have adaptive

777
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,250
strategies for instance this campaign C

778
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,420
11 has four different registrar's and is

779
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,850
actually jumping from register to

780
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,040
register we see certain small pikes on

781
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,540
the first one it might be that the

782
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,760
resale is from time to time also for

783
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,670
instance taking the cheapest Road or a

784
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,020
registration but the registers is

785
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,060
something obviously that we can see in a

786
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,270
graph but we saw much more variation

787
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:18,120
within the adaptations done by the magis

788
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:20,520
actus so for instance if you are looking

789
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,429
the registers we see some of them are

790
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,070
using three to four three registers in

791
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,060
line with the graph we saw before but

792
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,030
they're actually creating fake

793
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,889
identities over and over so in order to

794
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,480
actually register the domain name a

795
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,830
malicious actor need registered

796
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,140
information they need an email address a

797
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,000
phone number and address and they're

798
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,130
actually using tools or they do it

799
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,800
manually to create new fake addresses

800
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,230
new fake numbers new email addresses and

801
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,419
you see cert of them or actually just

802
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,530
stick into one phone number or one email

803
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:53,410
address but some of them are actual

804
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,300
using 20 50 70 of those attended peace

805
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,460
and what we saw in our dataset is that

806
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,159
they're often having actually a kind of

807
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,200
a pool of street names a pool of names a

808
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,580
pool of phone numbers and then I ran

809
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,950
them combining them to new registered

810
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,810
information which a little bit helped us

811
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:13,060
and actually compiling this kind of

812
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:15,070
analysis then the question is of course

813
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,290
now we have done a whole manual analysis

814
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,090
it's a one-time thing that we did there

815
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,740
are two options either we can try to

816
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,389
automate this analysis and even improve

817
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,600
with automatic tools the things that we

818
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,340
now found manually this is number one we

819
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,439
can actually also try to go to this tech

820
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,659
fact that we say now we can actually use

821
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,910
an information to protect the TLD to

822
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,980
protect the end users so let me first

823
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,930
look into how can we automate the

824
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,700
campaign identification and then look

825
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:43,270
into how can we actually improve the

826
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,250
quality of domain names and it eld so

827
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,870
the first one what we try to do is

828
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,760
actually now we actually grouped based

829
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,129
on similarities and patterns different

830
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,870
regulations together we can also use

831
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,190
machine learning techniques and one of

832
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,199
the techniques that we used in our study

833
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,840
was agglomerative clustering where

834
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,860
actually we actually grouping

835
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,320
registration together based on

836
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,719
similarities between the registrations

837
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,570
until we actually find a certain optimum

838
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,540
we did that and we found that we when we

839
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:12,550
have 432 clusters which actually thirty

840
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:15,220
forty four hundred and thirty two groups

841
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,440
of domain names the 30 largest clusters

842
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,000
already represent 92 percent of our data

843
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,490
set which was far as a good cutoff to

844
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,120
say let's look in it 30 largest clusters

845
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:28,690
within that machine learning set and

846
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,399
here we map it on the x-axis we see the

847
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,530
clusters that all automatically compiled

848
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,070
by the computer by the agglomerative

849
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:38,320
clustering on y-axis we see the 20

850
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,450
campaigns that we have and we're trying

851
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,310
to validate how well did we do where can

852
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,530
we improve why do we better then

853
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,899
automate it and so these are the three

854
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,820
insights that we have on this part so

855
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:53,320
what are the findings here well good

856
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:56,020
news the green ones here or about 26 of

857
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,470
those clusters we can find exactly one

858
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,480
campaign that matches that cluster a

859
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,680
campaign can exist out of multiple of

860
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,180
those clusters which actually means that

861
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,100
there are multiple similar

862
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,810
registrations rolling through the same

863
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,959
campaign but we see there's a one-on-one

864
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:15,270
mapping unfortunately it's not pays for

865
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,850
all of those receive for instance that

866
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,710
for three of them we see one cluster

867
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,480
which actually means very similar

868
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,670
registrations and they end up in our

869
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,820
analysis in two different campaigns and

870
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,530
we see it four three four three periods

871
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,740
that actually makes an assumption that

872
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,720
it's not 20 actors but about seventeen

873
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,390
actors at all being active within the

874
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,520
dot EU TLD and indeed for some of them

875
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,810
you can actually visually see there's

876
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,590
some correlation for instance the first

877
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:47,230
c1 and c2 also in time correct quite

878
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,820
nice and also if we inspected manually

879
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,730
what are the relations between the two

880
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,409
campaigns we see that it while reusing

881
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,940
certain the registration data bit in

882
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,730
between number using for instance the

883
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,560
same phone number and so on so if you

884
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,820
would have been doing or manual criteria

885
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,429
analysis even a little bit better

886
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:06,040
probably we would have ended up with c2

887
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,990
and c3 being one campaign and the same

888
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,840
for the other two so this is something

889
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,090
the automatic tool can help to improve

890
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,810
identification process the second thing

891
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:19,629
we see clusters that are not mapped to

892
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,740
any of the campaigns interesting that

893
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,070
means that we missed something and

894
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,990
indeed with this cluster 16 we did so

895
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,419
many validation and then the depth that

896
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:31,450
we were too restrictive in specifying

897
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,580
campaign C 20 so in the same days with

898
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,160
the same patterns but different email

899
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,780
provider plus the 16 was active so if it

900
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,020
would actually combine the manual and

901
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:44,980
automated but for sure we would say C 16

902
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:47,590
here is belonging to campaign 2000 time

903
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,900
at ik tools can improve so it's all bad

904
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,510
as we so do so badly in doing the manual

905
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:56,830
analysis luckily we found also finding 3

906
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:58,540
there was one cluster plus I campaign 15

907
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,090
it was not present in any of the 30

908
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,470
clusters that we found here and then we

909
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,449
started to looking in what is happening

910
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,990
here why does this actually not end up

911
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,760
in the the logit clusters well then we

912
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,489
looked into the smaller clusters so we

913
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,600
remember we had about 400 clusters so

914
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,699
we're looking into the other clusters

915
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,040
which of them all belonging to campaign

916
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:21,549
C 15 so the green dots

917
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,199
or the campaign and the red dots here or

918
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,660
all clusters contributing to that

919
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,580
campaign and we see that they have a lot

920
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,250
of small clusters with very similar

921
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,620
registration details even running on the

922
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,929
same days but they have a lot of those

923
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,909
different clusters so it looks like this

924
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,520
campaign is much more advanced actually

925
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:43,449
trying to circumvent automatic detection

926
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,639
by the string pills and indeed if you're

927
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,049
looking to see 15 what was actually the

928
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,969
pattern so let me give you a little bit

929
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,520
inside remember in the beginning we saw

930
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:53,739
quite easy campaign criteria where we

931
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,600
say well by using one de Mol provider

932
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:57,279
there were few streets and phone numbers

933
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,140
well this one was much clever and I

934
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,480
would even say we give him the award of

935
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,520
the best of was skating campaign in our

936
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,590
data set

937
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,880
it actually is about 500 domains that

938
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,090
were registered over a long period of

939
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,340
time 258 days and that were actually

940
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,620
using a generation tool to create fake

941
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,570
identities so they actually used the LA

942
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,460
virtual tool they loaded it with dutch

943
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:21,070
information and then also complement in

944
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,900
the last months with English surname

945
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:26,800
lost engine secrets and they actually

946
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,720
created 98 registrants with that then

947
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,730
the next step what were the domain names

948
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,109
looking like well interesting because of

949
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,180
this audience that were actually Dutch

950
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,190
words so this was also the reason why we

951
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,379
by analyzing the domain names it popped

952
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:40,930
up that have also gotten similar is some

953
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,310
rarities between different clusters so

954
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,470
they're actually using a large

955
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,060
vocabulary of Dutch words and they're

956
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,709
always combining two or three words and

957
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,720
there might even be letters in between

958
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,340
one binding letter in between which does

959
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,040
not make any sense in Dutch but we'll

960
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:57,580
done by the person typing in those words

961
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,680
and we see luckily that the same Dutch

962
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,630
words in that dataset or being reused

963
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,649
among different sets of registries

964
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,350
registrants

965
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,990
so within 98 if they would each

966
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,759
individually use a small set of domain

967
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,620
names and create them it will be very

968
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,930
hard for us to link them but now because

969
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,670
they were using the same word across 98

970
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,379
registrants we could easily see that

971
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,530
there were relationships between those

972
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,030
98 registrants we saw also certain

973
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,290
patterns in the way that were describing

974
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,970
Street and song say there made some

975
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,190
mistakes and doing your registration

976
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:29,680
which helped us to see but it gives you

977
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,900
the idea it's very hard to automatically

978
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,230
find out that all those registrations

979
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,700
together also interesting detailed they

980
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,749
actually have kind of not fully

981
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,689
automated but they were always

982
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:43,689
registering their registrants and

983
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:45,220
batches of 8 16 24 or 32 which was for

984
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,190
us an actual validation that we found

985
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,720
all of them but again we can do this

986
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,819
manually it's very hard to do this

987
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,769
automatically so actually I would

988
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:56,319
advocate after doing both manual and

989
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:58,029
automated we probably need both of both

990
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:59,769
worlds we actually need the best of both

991
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:02,380
worlds to actually combine both the

992
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:04,899
insight that we easily can see by human

993
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,630
reading to data also combined with a

994
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:16,720
tool that is actually doing it in a very

995
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:18,160
resistant way yeah and also well there

996
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,259
because they were using a generation

997
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,970
tool they were also reusing certain

998
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:32,799
registration details across different

999
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:34,930
registrants No so the question was is it

1000
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:37,210
correct to say that only the last three

1001
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:39,009
bullets were actually helping to detect

1002
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,410
it in a manual analysis I think it's

1003
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,089
true for a large part of the analysis

1004
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:46,598
there were certain things that were

1005
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:47,049
being reused but a lot of our tool as

1006
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,420
well

1007
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:50,619
so that we could link and they also made

1008
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,170
some mistakes in the way that were

1009
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,910
entering street names which also was

1010
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,829
something unique compared to all the

1011
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,450
other campaigns within our data set but

1012
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:00,309
indeed it was mainly because of the

1013
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:04,509
Dutch words that we had the good trigger

1014
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:07,539
we need to investigate also interesting

1015
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:09,220
this was the campaign that was not seen

1016
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:12,749
very well with blacklist I think only

1017
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:15,488
50% of them were on blacklist services

1018
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:18,129
so with that actually going to the end

1019
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:19,420
of my talk so I will promise you to tell

1020
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,089
a little bit more how can we automate

1021
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,220
this and actually making TLD more secure

1022
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,190
well how can we go with detection of

1023
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,558
prevention and there the insight is if

1024
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,119
you now know all those characteristics

1025
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:32,619
of how with the mainers or actually

1026
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,749
creating new domain names for malicious

1027
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,940
use what is the next step that we need

1028
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:39,160
to do but actually at registration time

1029
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,700
already detect or prevent malicious

1030
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,529
domain names how far can we go there so

1031
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,848
what we did is actually we again used

1032
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:47,289
machine learning tools

1033
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:48,849
we used agglomerative clustering based

1034
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,859
on the similarity similar as we did in

1035
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:52,420
the previous exercise we also using

1036
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:54,999
classification based on the reputation

1037
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,130
of a phone number email address register

1038
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,890
and so on and we're actually combining

1039
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,839
this in a kind of prediction service and

1040
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,479
we now have already early results over

1041
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,788
the large data sets on the past that be

1042
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:08,589
around between 60 and 70% of the

1043
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:11,259
malicious domain names can already be

1044
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:13,328
found at the time of registration with a

1045
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:14,979
very very low false positive rate like

1046
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:17,709
to registration reading stations a day

1047
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:19,689
which actually means we can easy a route

1048
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:21,339
over the more than half of all the

1049
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,079
messages domain names just by making it

1050
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,969
much harder for the domain use to make

1051
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,089
their Gator registrations into the

1052
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:30,880
system and as we speak we're actually

1053
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:32,769
deploying this as part of Eris trust and

1054
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,569
security program to actually prevent

1055
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:38,910
those domain names from being registered

1056
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:41,949
in the near future within the dot-eu TLD

1057
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:44,348
so let me conclude we actually analyzed

1058
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:45,729
40 months of registration data we saw

1059
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:49,059
the hidden strategies but already

1060
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:50,468
mentioned in literature we saw some very

1061
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:52,029
long running campaigns and some of the

1062
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:54,339
campaigns already started at the

1063
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:56,259
beginning or even continued after or

1064
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:58,269
data set was ending so it actually means

1065
00:39:56,259 --> 00:40:00,789
that this is actually an underestimation

1066
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:03,999
of how long campaigns are running we see

1067
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:05,410
variety and intensity duration but more

1068
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,749
important we see a variety and how

1069
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:10,749
adaptive they are to actually lure

1070
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:12,038
around the blacklist services we saw

1071
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:13,868
some interesting alignments with

1072
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:17,380
business activity on purpose or

1073
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:19,150
mimicking we don't know we saw that the

1074
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,499
top two facilitators have a huge

1075
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,660
footprint they actually the top three

1076
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:25,238
facilitators registrar's email addresses

1077
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,759
or email providers actually represent a

1078
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,799
large fraction of our data set and we

1079
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,420
also saw that with the campaign analysis

1080
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:35,229
we actually can extend you know how we

1081
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,519
already have in blacklist services we

1082
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:39,129
saw that we can actually work towards

1083
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,238
automatic campaign identification and it

1084
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,119
would actually be nice interplay between

1085
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,739
manual and automated and we also see

1086
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,630
that we can go to proactive detection

1087
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,339
and prevention and I hope within six

1088
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,079
months I can give you an update on how

1089
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:51,729
successful this is actually in practice

1090
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,279
about EU TLD

1091
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:56,198
if you want to know more we also have a

1092
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:57,819
paper published with much more details

1093
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,229
on all the different parts of the

1094
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,779
campaign analysis you can easily

1095
00:40:59,229 --> 00:41:02,060
download

1096
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,310
only role provided there and with that

1097
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm open for questions all for lunch you

1098
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:25,690
decide questions well I will be honest

1099
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,220
we didn't say all the details we had

1100
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,810
nice interesting conversations with the

1101
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,480
team members and also with the dot au

1102
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,799
TLD we give you the flavor but there are

1103
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,660
much more details of actually helping us

1104
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,460
in detecting and that's the reason why

1105
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,140
we don't present the full data set that

1106
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,220
we don't present this extra criteria but

1107
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,629
give you a lot of flavor

1108
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,040
we used email dress we used to street

1109
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,410
name and so on but you're fully right

1110
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,580
the more the more we disclose the easier

1111
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:52,970
it is for attackers to actually apply it

1112
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:54,830
even on all the domains of course we

1113
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,910
like the idea that the Dutch are the

1114
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:01,819
best but what is your confidence that

1115
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:04,339
that you haven't missed campaigns in

1116
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,830
your analysis yeah so we did for sure

1117
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:09,380
miss campaigns from all the domains that

1118
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:12,200
were blacklisted by spam house and all

1119
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,150
those 80% of them ended up in one of the

1120
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,069
20 campaigns so I would say the 20

1121
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,750
campaigns already have like an 80%

1122
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,090
coverage of the existing black services

1123
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,670
if I look - how many domains are

1124
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,620
probably probably generated by DJ and so

1125
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,450
on I would say the 2.5 is probably an

1126
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,250
underestimate so we're missing things

1127
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,589
but we started from the point what do we

1128
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,820
see from the blacklist services also for

1129
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,630
the DJ's it's much more difficult

1130
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,690
because a lot of domain name

1131
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,070
registrations with DJ footprints or not

1132
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,840
registered by the malicious actors but

1133
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,810
actually by security researchers which

1134
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:44,780
makes it much more difficult yeah

1135
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:47,990
question so and you researched it for a

1136
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,610
you top-level domain right do you have I

1137
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,919
have two questions do you have an idea

1138
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,960
why this EU domain was used in the first

1139
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,600
place and if you put these security

1140
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,070
measures in place are there not moving

1141
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,440
to another top-level domain

1142
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,930
very quickly so that that the effect of

1143
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,630
these security measures are very easily

1144
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,940
mitigated so why did we start with EU

1145
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,860
well in order to actually have the idea

1146
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,800
of actually working on improving

1147
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,370
security this is the amount of the

1148
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,960
people that

1149
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,400
actually running the WD that's the

1150
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,080
reason why we started there this is a

1151
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,220
kind of close collaboration ready for

1152
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,049
many years that we actually trying to

1153
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,029
improve the security there so that's the

1154
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:24,230
reason there you collect your rights

1155
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,000
that actually by raising the bar on

1156
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,280
one's own it will actually make it more

1157
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,660
pushing to other zones but the main idea

1158
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,400
is that we want to be very open so that

1159
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,440
the LDS or often communicating to each

1160
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,180
other in many conferences so we're

1161
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,640
presenting this work as well the IDS I

1162
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,990
raise the bar together it will be a

1163
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,089
little bit harder for the attacker we

1164
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,979
will never be able to completely rude it

1165
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:45,320
but the attacker has to spend more money

1166
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,500
and it's less effective in doing that

1167
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,790
that's the main ID and in that sense it

1168
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,530
might be the first step but were not the

1169
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,330
only one working on this we see that all

1170
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,520
the large T all these like for comments

1171
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,930
one are also trying to improve the

1172
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:03,230
number of multi degree stations being

1173
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:05,660
dropped one quick last question yeah

1174
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:09,530
okay so sorry

1175
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,620
so fishing best practices recommend that

1176
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:15,970
he use already classified domains

1177
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,859
because a lot of organization use

1178
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:23,660
devices such as IBM blue code if I'm not

1179
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:26,090
mistaken and the idea is you try to

1180
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:30,350
leverage the trust or classification

1181
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:33,970
those tools already use into pretty much

1182
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:37,160
starts from a trusted position right and

1183
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:42,459
the question is why did you decide not

1184
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:45,830
to consider re-registration or yeah

1185
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:48,260
registration of or actually purchasing

1186
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:51,200
of already registered domain so there

1187
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,640
are two reasons why we actually closed

1188
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,549
the scope the newly registered domain

1189
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,080
names I would say the first one is the

1190
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,430
context we need to grind through to know

1191
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,279
actually what a domain name is malicious

1192
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:02,990
or benign and when we are actually doing

1193
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,220
a registration or transfers that

1194
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,290
actually means that domain names are

1195
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,520
already a reputation and in that sense

1196
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,710
it could already because they have a

1197
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,450
benign reputation that moment if you

1198
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:13,360
don't have a clear view on how these or

1199
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,500
things are evolving so this is one thing

1200
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,810
the other thing is with the new legal

1201
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,100
registrations we we we can still do

1202
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,900
something we can actually prevent them

1203
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,640
from being active if you say we have a

1204
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,820
domain name there's already active for

1205
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,078
about five years eight years what are

1206
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,969
the means that you have in that

1207
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,769
in place you say now we will start

1208
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:32,599
preventing it from a registry point of

1209
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,549
view you have no means of actually

1210
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,499
something that might have legitimate

1211
00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:38,269
traffic that gets reported and then

1212
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:40,038
start to block where's the impact of

1213
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,569
something that is newly registered then

1214
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:43,400
you can start communicating your legal

1215
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:45,049
team can contact them and asking what is

1216
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,390
the purpose of this domain name do you

1217
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:48,410
have all the documents and so on and

1218
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,109
that's the reason why we focused on

1219
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,430
honor the newly but I think even the

1220
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:54,469
ones that all registered already in the

1221
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,569
past might actually provide additional

1222
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:59,299
context to see even for the newly ones

1223
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:01,219
those might be name cells with a lot of

1224
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:02,869
toxicity for instance and in that it

1225
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:04,969
could improve it but I think it's much

1226
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,709
hard to do the detecting prevention

1227
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:09,529
because once the domain name isn't as

1228
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:12,169
active it's much harder to to do any

1229
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:14,709
regulation on it okay

1230
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,709
thank you

1231
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,570
[Applause]
