um so good morning good afternoon good

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,380
evening uh wherever this finds you

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,880
whether you're watching it live we're

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,799
actually recorded afterwards I hope it

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,380
finds you well so just let's get these

41
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,759

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,040
all right so the team of 30 million

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,320
players now hopefully we'll all be doing

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,299
this in person very very soon and

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,159
there's some amazing ohos events coming

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,140
up that you can join in with to do just

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,119
that but for today we're still virtual

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,340
so we're gonna keep this going the way

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,299
we have done for the last couple of

50
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,740
years

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,439
um as faran said my name is Laura

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,880
um but I'm not here today to talk about

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,100
what I do professionally I'm here to

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,180
talk about something I'm quite

55
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,520
passionate about and something that you

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,560
can join in with with your team your

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
organization with your organization is

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
you know thousands of Engineers or just

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
yourself

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,700
um and I'm really very passionate about

61
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,860
it now a little bit about my background

62
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,500
I've done lots of things my mom is very

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,360
very proud but other than that you don't

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
need to worry about it the reason though

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,819
I put the slide up is because we all

66
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,620
have a journey that looks like this that

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,959
has lots of different things in it at

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,940
different times and all of those

69
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,980
experiences whether in our personal life

70
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,620
or professional life they shape the way

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,260
that we think about security and in fact

72
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,900
this talk comes from something in most

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,879
of our lives that shaped my thinking of

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,440
security

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,540
now I'm going to have a caveat I don't

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,160
normally do disclaimers at the start of

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,660
talks but I'm going to because this is

78
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,580
very important

79
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,620
um I wanted to acknowledge that I'm

80
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900
going to use the covert situation from

81
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,640
the last two years

82
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,180
um as an analogy in this talk now I'm

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,580
not using that as humor I'm not using it

84
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,060
to lighten or to show disservice to what

85
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,159
has been a really horrible situation for

86
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,040
many many people but I think I think

87
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,420
you'll agree by the end of this talk

88
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,640
that there's an importance in drawing

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,260
analogies when they are found in the

90
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,879
world around us because it can change

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
the way we think and so if we can use a

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
bad thing to come up with a new way of

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,540
doing something then that can be a very

94
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,180
powerful lesson so please note no

95
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,860
offense is intended

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,780
um and to those who have suffered any

97
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,940
hardship or harm from the last few years

98
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,739
you have my complete support and

99
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,720
sympathies

100
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
so let's talk about it the team of 30

101
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,860
million

102
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,140
whether you know it or not there are 30

103
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,879
million approximately software

104
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,720
developers in the world right now now I

105
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,400
don't know about you but that number is

106
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,220
mind-blowing to me um I can't really

107
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,959
comprehend how many people that is I'm

108
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,540
here at RSA at the moment you're joining

109
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,400
me from a glamorous hotel room at six

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,440
o'clock in the morning uh where there

111
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
are 27 000 people here and for me that

112
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,420
feels like a huge number so I can't

113
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
really begin to imagine all of the

114
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,959
software developers we have in the world

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
and it turns out that we're adding an

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,079
astonishing 1.2 million of those a year

117
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,000
now if you also includes software

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,979
testers that's another five million

119
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,160
people so that's a lot of people now

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,500
this got me thinking

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,440
security has historically we talk a lot

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,180
about appsec engineers and security

123
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,919
Specialists and I've been one for a

124
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,240
number of years many of the people who

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
will watch this talk are that way

126
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,139
but what if just you know theoretically

127
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:44,759
instead of having you know the team of a

128
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,160
few thousand at SEC Engineers globally

129
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,220
we could become the team of 30 million

130
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,020
now let me tell you a little bit of

131
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,540
story of where this came from

132
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,699
now I spend a lot of time with

133
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,979
development teams like many of you do

134
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,620
um looking at how mature they are and

135
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,720
what I've discovered shouldn't be a

136
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
surprise really it's that while we do

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,220
talk a lot about some of the very

138
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,199
Cutting Edge teams the Netflix of those

139
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,360
who you know on the very very bleeding

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,340
edge of Technology they're doing appsec

141
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,660
at speed that most of us can't

142
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,479
comprehend that only represents two

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,419
percent of our global population of

144
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,919
organizations

145
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,320
the rest of us in what we call

146
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,180
fragmented exploration are emerging

147
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,100
which means that we're trying to do

148
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,780
stuff or we're not sure where to begin

149
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,580
and that's okay

150
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,380
now what's this got to do with the team

151
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,960
of 30 million well if we all focus on

152
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,580
just the cutting-edge companies and what

153
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,199
they're doing and hopefully it helps our

154
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,500
ecosystem now we're missed opportunity

155
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,479
for this massive Collective of

156
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,580
organizations to contribute together and

157
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,960
in this talk I'm going to show you how

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
to do it but let me start with a bit of

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
a story

160
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,800
it was April 2020. like most of us the

161
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,720
world was shifting very very rapidly and

162
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,400
in New Zealand where I live

163
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,500
that was no different we were about to

164
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,320
enter a lockdown like many have stood in

165
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,199
that period we were learning about

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,600
pandemics firsthand now even if you'd

167
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
read about them before there's something

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
about living through one that is very

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,100
different

170
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,380
and we started learning about infections

171
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,940
and N numbers

172
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,039
and I remember sitting there maybe

173
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,960
perhaps it's just part being a security

174
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,240
person that you see in their situation

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
and you see security problems you just

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,900
can't help it

177
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,639
um but I remember sitting there and

178
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,960
looking at what people were talking

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,259
about about you know contagious viruses

180
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,639
and going

181
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,580
I suppose if one person is sick can they

182
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,080
spread it to two people and they spread

183
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,419
it to four and so on and so forth

184
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,580
this looks a lot like malicious software

185
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,259
this looks a lot like viruses and

186
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,620
malware we've seen this before now

187
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,780
While most of my family were happily

188
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,639
embracing making sourdough or doing

189
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,039
whatever else you did in the pandemic

190
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,500
I started thinking well if we looked at

191
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,960
how we respond to a pandemic are the

192
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,819
parallels we can draw in information

193
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,000
security that would allow us to

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,940
to change the way we do it and perhaps

195
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,539
protect large populations of people

196
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,360
now why am I thinking this well it's

197
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
because whenever you have something

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,940
that's a shared human event you

199
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,500
automatically have a language that

200
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,940
translates between large groups of

201
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,919
people this is this does what we call

202
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,199
reducing cognitive load so it makes it

203
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,940
much much easier to understand the

204
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,020
concept because people already

205
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,419
understand the foundations so there's an

206
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,580
opportunity there

207
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,699
now what I noticed was in New Zealand we

208
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,979
actually had a five-stage approach to

209
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,139
managing covid now I don't think anyone

210
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,580
really called it this five-stage

211
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,319
approach but when I started looking at

212
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,880
it and pulling the data together there

213
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
were five steps we were taking

214
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,960
and those five steps it turns out are

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
things that you can take into your

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,680
organization and if we take them into

217
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,020
all of our organizations then we can

218
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
actually start protecting applications

219
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,039
on a scale we've never done before so

220
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,139
let me walk you through it

221
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,840
now just a bit of a kind of take-home

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,180
thought for you I'm going to outline

223
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,639
five different methods here

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,500
um and they can apply to companies that

225
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,259
have no resources no team and equally to

226
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,759
big companies that have massive

227
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,840
resources

228
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,720
pick the bits that work for you because

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,840
the thing with sharing security

230
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,460
responsibility or collaborating in

231
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,800
security is it's not about us all doing

232
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
everything and spending a million

233
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,099
dollars each year on security it's about

234
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,039
every little step we do as a combined

235
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,799
population coming together to make us

236
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,140
all safer and more secure

237
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,000
so let's get stuck in with the first

238
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,839
stage of this that's what I call tracing

239
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,240
so tracing what was it in the covered

240
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,339
sense well in New Zealand like many of

241
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,440
you we had an application for contact

242
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
racing so the idea in the coveted sense

243
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,180
was if somebody was infected and they

244
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,100
were getting sick then you wanted to

245
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,380
contact all of the people that they have

246
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,300
been around so that you could warn them

247
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,880
that they might too be getting sick and

248
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,580
so that they isolate and take steps okay

249
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,980
great fantastic so we have the routine

250
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,019
where it sits in the covert world so how

251
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,740
do we as security folk as developers

252
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,480
adapt this to be part of our world how

253
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,820
can we use tracing to protect Global

254
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,440
software

255
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,899
well there's a thing with how we

256
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,580
approach securing our products at the

257
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,740
moment now I code as well as being a

258
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,839
security person and I you know I have a

259
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,459
team of people I work with to build an

260
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,380
education platform so that's awesome

261
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,019
but you can it's very easy and I do it

262
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,060
myself to see yourself as the center of

263
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,800
the universe much like we did you know

264
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,080
back in the the very very olden days

265
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,120
where we didn't really understand how

266
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,440
the planets worked and how things

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,779
rotated around the sun we thought you

268
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:46,980
know we were the center of the universe

269
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,240
we were the most important thing that

270
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,740
was the only thing to focus on in fact

271
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,260
tracing encourages us rather than think

272
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,820
about ourselves as the center of the

273
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
universe but to consider a position in

274
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,660
the universe

275
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,820
now this here

276
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,220
is a picture that I've taken from Anne

277
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,260
wanker now this QR code you're seeing on

278
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,839
screen will take you to this uh page

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,160
itself so please don't worry I'm not

280
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,180
going to Rickroll you I'm not that

281
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,500
person

282
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,399
um

283
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,980
but I'm showing you because it's a way

284
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,800
of visualizing the universe we sit in so

285
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm Vanka in this case is visualizing

286
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,540
the connections between the browserfi

287
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,600
npm package and all of the other

288
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,180
packages it connects to so by connects

289
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,519
to it means they inherit from or are

290
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,519
connected to it by other code now

291
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,800
you may install browser if I which will

292
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,779
be you know several tens of lines of

293
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,540
code but in fact by doing so you end up

294
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,820
connected to an ecosystem and all

295
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,920
software is like this right we don't

296
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,019
build everything from scratch anymore if

297
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,000
you're that person that's cool at all

298
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,220
but it's a quite an inefficient way to

299
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,019
build software now we're all used to the

300
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,079
idea that when we build code we bring in

301
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,240
other people's code to augment it to do

302
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
those functions that it's not worth

303
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,899
Wireless building ourselves or in some

304
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,940
cases it's not safe for us to build

305
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,820
ourselves for example cryptography we've

306
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,040
been saying for a very long time use

307
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,560
good quality components that you can

308
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,839
trust because well that makes you more

309
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,279
safe and secure

310
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,440
so what does this graph in this universe

311
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,019
have to do with protecting our Global

312
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,700
ecosystem

313
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,760
well firstly let me clarify this isn't

314
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,019
about node because there'll be at least

315
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,279
one person who watches the video who

316
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,380
goes oh no she's going to rant about mpm

317
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,839
that's not true this is a picture from

318
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
libraries.io now I love the team at

319
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,880
libraries.io and what they did they've

320
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
basically become the Librarians of

321
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,079
packet package managers they can tell

322
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,120
you where all of the packages are in the

323
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,240
different ecosystems now npm at the top

324
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,880
corner there has 2.3 million packages

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
that's quite a lot you'll have to admit

326
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,899
but the average package length there's

327
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,120
about 10 lines of code so there's lots

328
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
of them they're very very small if

329
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,899
you're in something else say you're in

330
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,300
Maven or you use nougat or you're in the

331
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,300
python space and using Pippi you equally

332
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,760
have hundreds of thousands of packages

333
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,920
at your disposal

334
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
now when we start looking at contact

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
tracing or tracing in our software

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,640
ecosystem it's all about understanding

337
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,339
how we relate to the packages that our

338
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,500
software is made from and the software

339
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,480
our software is made from

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,700
this gets quite confusing but let me go

341
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,079
a little bit further

342
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,060
what we're talking about here is what we

343
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,279
call transitive risk the risk you

344
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,680
inherit from those connected to or

345
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,160
successive members of the sequence so if

346
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,680
I use package a and package a uses

347
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,899
package B and package B uses Package C

348
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,680
we're all connected and related now in

349
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,019
some circumstances not all but in some

350
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,260
circumstances you can inherit risk from

351
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,899
Package C even though your two steps

352
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,300
removed from it and this is much like

353
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,700
the human risk we learned about in covid

354
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,800
by being connected to people and having

355
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,680
those interactions with them we can find

356
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,600
that security vulnerabilities come our

357
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,380
way

358
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,360
so how can manage transitive security

359
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,060
risk what does it mean for us

360
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,820
well we have to draw our own graph much

361
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,279
like Ivanka does it for npm we have to

362
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,620
figure out what we're connected to now

363
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,899
in some environments that might be

364
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,160
really straightforward you just pull

365
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,079
your package into pencil list fantastic

366
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,399
job done

367
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,500
but for many of us that's not the case

368
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,240
now if you're an environment that has

369
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,040
grown over a number of years your

370
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,899
dependency is probably doesn't include

371
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,839
one ecosystem it might include many

372
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,820
it may include components that were

373
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,040
built years and years and years ago we

374
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
call these a legacy or Foundation

375
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,420
components now you might not have a

376
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,740
package dependency list for those

377
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,180
because well they may not have been

378
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,700
built in a long time

379
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,019
you might find that well you know what

380
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,660
you build from each of those components

381
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,000
that you build from also has its list of

382
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,459
dependencies and so you end up with this

383
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,880
big graph so nodes and edges where

384
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,700
you're visualizing how much of the world

385
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
software you touch with your simple

386
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,120
application

387
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,279
and the more complicated and more

388
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,200
densely uh interconnected your

389
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,540
application is the more impact that

390
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,540
ecosystem has on you so you start to

391
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,600
feel the real visceral impact of the

392
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
software development community that we

393
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,540
live in

394
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,820
now why this matters is what we would

395
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,800
call in this huge space a supply chain

396
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,820
attack

397
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,079
now

398
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,500
supply chain attacks in security have

399
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,139
been gaining a lot of press so whether

400
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,180
you've seen solar winds or you saw the

401
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,220
log for J vulnerability

402
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,779
you may not think of them as supply

403
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,940
chain attacks but they are in the sense

404
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,760
that they are used by many applications

405
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,839
and organizations and in such as such

406
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,699
when they are compromised the ripple

407
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,800
effect through that transitive uh

408
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,540
vulnerability that transitive risk that

409
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,199
we've talked about is huge now if you

410
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,940
were affected by log for Jay you will

411
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,139
know this because you probably had some

412
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,300
work to do that day but if you were not

413
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,100
if you're using a different ecosystem or

414
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,019
language you may not have experienced

415
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,880
this first hand yet

416
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,639
supply chain risk is increasing and it's

417
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,740
going to increase a lot more and I'm

418
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,540
going to explain why

419
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,519
I want to use Heroku as an example now

420
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,620
if there's anyone from Heroku or using

421
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,360
Heroku that is watching this talk please

422
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,180
no this is not about a criticism in any

423
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,160
way you just happen to be in the Press

424
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
at the moment

425
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
um so I've been taking my stories and

426
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
statistics from very recent events and I

427
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,360
have to give my support and kudos to all

428
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,100
those involved in the current activities

429
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,300
going on there

430
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,019
now Heroku have recently undergone a

431
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,740
nasty supply chain attack so there uh

432
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
they are if you are not aware a platform

433
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,399
was a service organization so they allow

434
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,620
you to roll up spin up applications very

435
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,880
very quickly

436
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,100
um in their hosted infrastructure

437
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,139
they host at the moment and this is

438
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,000
taken from their website 13 million

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,459
applications and have 9 000 paying

440
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,800
customers globally now if you're an

441
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,620
attacker you are fundamentally quite

442
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,120
lazy now I don't say it in a bad way

443
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,220
lazy in the sense that why would you

444
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,920
attack nine thousand five hundred

445
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,260
customers or 30 million applications

446
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,540
independently when you can go after a

447
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,519
shared component uh share component

448
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,199
could be a library or it could be a

449
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,760
hosting provider

450
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,220
in this case it's a hosting provider now

451
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,260
just three of the case studies literally

452
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,300
taken from the hurricane website the

453
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,279
types of applications that are hosted on

454
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,560
us we have go to meeting now in the

455
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,839
world of pandemics having access to

456
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,279
video chat software has been pretty

457
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,380
important so there's some certain things

458
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,540
happening software like that we have a

459
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,060
DNS provider now it doesn't take a lot

460
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,220
of imagination to see what you would do

461
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,199
if you were able to compromise a DNS

462
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,660
provider you're literally rerouting the

463
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,040
traffic of the internet

464
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
now depend on what that DNS provider is

465
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,720
providing the records for it depends on

466
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,120
how important that attack would be and

467
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,420
then we have a medical company again all

468
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,980
of these are by no fault of their own

469
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,720
they chose well they chose the

470
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,419
technology they trusted but a compromise

471
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,819
happened in the supply chain and here

472
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,160
they are they're being associated now

473
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
just to repeat none of these companies

474
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,699
have done anything wrong I'm not saying

475
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,140
they're vulnerable today they've their

476
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,339
instant response teams will have been

477
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,780
over this for a number of weeks and

478
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,780
months however it makes you think it

479
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,339
makes you think of the power of that

480
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,900
connection and the vulnerability we

481
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,660
inherit from it much like in covid where

482
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,220
we were vulnerable because as people

483
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,840
we're connected to each other and we

484
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,120
interact with each other in technology

485
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,400
we inherit the same risk

486
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,260
so we have to come up with a way that we

487
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,600
can contact trace or understand those

488
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,039
risks that we inherit from each other

489
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,919
and it starts at the very beginning it

490
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,600
starts with us choosing our software

491
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,419
I've just chosen a package at random I

492
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,179
literally went to Google and I googled

493
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,539
for open source crypto Library fabulous

494
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,000
now many of us have chosen libraries in

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,039
the past of course we have and I'm going

496
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,320
to be really honest many of the studies

497
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,120
are particularly mature framework for

498
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,440
choosing those libraries you know our

499
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,660
first concern is does it do the job that

500
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,820
it says it's going to do and then many

501
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,140
of us will look at things like well does

502
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,080
it have lots of stars or are there lots

503
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,120
of people using it

504
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,340
so contact tracing starts with

505
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,140
understand the technology you use the

506
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,360
technology we use starts with choosing

507
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,760
the right things so how can we make sure

508
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
that we start our contact tracing

509
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
efforts by having a great really

510
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,679
well-defined list of software we can

511
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,360
trust to begin with

512
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,179
well we could have an open source

513
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,880
evaluation set of questions now all of

514
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,020
these slides will be shared afterwards

515
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,640
I'll be releasing a white paper free of

516
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
charge that will have all of these

517
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,460
questions in so you can go and use them

518
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,900
in your teams

519
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,679
um

520
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,539
but these are the questions we need to

521
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,120
start asking about every single library

522
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,220
and framework that we do now no tool is

523
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,740
going to do this for you I would love to

524
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,700
say there was going to be a tool that's

525
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,320
faulty problems that isn't there are

526
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,700
tools that will help with part of this

527
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,799
so for example the OS dependency Checker

528
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
where it's going to tell you are there

529
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,039
known vulnerabilities that's a great

530
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,360
project if you haven't used you should

531
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,039
go check that out

532
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,900
um but other things we should look at is

533
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,940
the code fresh is there active

534
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,740
contribution is it regularly released

535
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,320
and maintained does it have existing

536
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,880
issues not just in the security sense

537
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,740
but in the functionality senses how

538
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,260
frequently are they found

539
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,240
what is the project culture is it a

540
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,000
great safe place to share cups or is it

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,919
a bit of a toxic mess

542
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,200
you do all of this internally if you're

543
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,179
a colleague's code base you would be

544
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,120
looking for these just naturally

545
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,220
um it's time now that we start looking

546
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,740
for them in an organized way when we

547
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,240
take in open source libraries and

548
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,559
software

549
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,160
now hey the the Keynotes were those in

550
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,919
there is we are understanding that we're

551
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,720
connected to lots of other libraries and

552
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,760
Frameworks and they are connected to

553
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,980
other libraries and Frameworks and much

554
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,720
like we did in covert we understood our

555
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,539
risk via contact tracing understanding

556
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,299
that graph that we sit in is really key

557
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,100
to understanding our exposure and risk

558
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,140
because step one of identifying if

559
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,179
something bad has happened if you know

560
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,340
that a component in your your ecosystem

561
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,640
has been compromised you can map out if

562
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,280
you're likely to be In Harm's Way too

563
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,140
change your Technologies consistently

564
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,600
and then you're able to understand that

565
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,919
you know each has a really good

566
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,679
technology to start with and that you've

567
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,419
considered risk to begin with now that's

568
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,740
not to say that there won't be risk in

569
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,200
the future but there will be uh at least

570
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,360
a little bit more to stand on and keep

571
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,400
up to date with secure keep up to date

572
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,580
the security news so that you can know

573
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,440
when you need to respond

574
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,840
now speaking of which let's move on to

575
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,360
our second stage so X second stage is

576
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,860
what we call distancing

577
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,260
so distancing in the covert times let's

578
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,360
talk about that now these posters from

579
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,740
New Zealand your countries will have

580
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,179
done different things but we had all of

581
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,799
these around they were everywhere you

582
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,059
couldn't walk without seeing a yellow

583
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,559
poster

584
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,600
um so wearing a face mask to keep your

585
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,660
mouth and face physically distant from

586
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,360
other people's you know liquids let's

587
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,740
call it that

588
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,480
um staying home if you're sick keeping

589
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
at least a meter apart or six feet if

590
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,960
you're in the U.S

591
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,480
all of these were very very important to

592
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,220
help us reduce risk

593
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,020
so what does distancing mean in our

594
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,400
software well this is where we start

595
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,919
talking about architecture now if you're

596
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,720
a software developer you may not have

597
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,220
ever considered yourself an architect

598
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,620
but you really are and sometimes the way

599
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,179
that we separate software architecture

600
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:34,919
from software development has been a

601
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,299
little bit dangerous

602
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,340
in software an architect isn't just

603
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,440
somebody who designs a system passively

604
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,240
it's also somebody who supervises its

605
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,039
implementation and make sure we're

606
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,500
understanding the connections uh between

607
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,179
our elements and planning them in such a

608
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,000
way that the risk is reduced so how can

609
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,100
we use analysis software architecture

610
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,880
and social distancing to create safety

611
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,400
in our applications well firstly let's

612
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,900
understand a little bit about basic

613
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,240
architecture at applications no longer

614
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,240
look like this we very rarely now have a

615
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
hard external framing which you know

616
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,020
contains our soft squidgy very

617
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,820
vulnerable and valuable middle

618
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,860
most her applications don't even look

619
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,080
like this anymore you know where we have

620
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,360
polite components and we know where they

621
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,740
are and what they're doing

622
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,539
most of our applications grow very

623
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,120
fluidly and very fast and they spread

624
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,919
out and in covert times has also

625
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,960
included a lot of applications that

626
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,880
suddenly went online or suddenly were

627
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,559
exposed to other sources because we

628
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,140
weren't physically in office anymore

629
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,140
distancing is about understanding how

630
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,559
our architecture has been built and how

631
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,480
we can put controls and barriers in

632
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,200
place between elements to prevent risk

633
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,700
now I'm going to use a really simple

634
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,140
example it's not even using technology

635
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,120
so forgive me for that but the reason

636
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,500
for that firstly at six o'clock in the

637
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,419
morning secondly it's because sometimes

638
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,980
you need to take it away from the tech

639
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,840
to really kind of find you grounded

640
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
let's talk about bears and honey now

641
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
obviously bears do like honey they're

642
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,500
like a lot of other things too but

643
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,059
unless she's honey in this example and

644
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,860
assume that your application had the

645
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,179
equivalent of honey in the middle of it

646
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,740
and your attacker which is our

647
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,659
equivalent of our bear is really going

648
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,000
to be Keen to get hold of that honey

649
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,520
now distancing in our architectural

650
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,580
sense is putting controls between our

651
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,919
bear and our honey that's going to

652
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,720
prevent the bear from getting it now

653
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,580
those could be preventative controls so

654
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,260
putting a bear trapper in the way for

655
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,220
example

656
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,740
it's going to stop the bear because if

657
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,360
the bear happens to Spring the Trap

658
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
they're going to get hurt

659
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,659
but there's a problem with this and we

660
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,860
can't just put bear traps and that's

661
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,020
because if you cover the entire floor in

662
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,940
Bear traps well you're not going to be

663
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,080
able to do much in your environment

664
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,220
anymore that's kind of like security

665
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,419
right if you put too many security

666
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,580
controls in it becomes a little bit

667
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,340
unworkable and there's a balance between

668
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,200
the number of preventative controls we

669
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,120
can put in place and the effectiveness

670
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,520
they're going to have so as well as

671
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,260
preventative controls we put other

672
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,240
controls in so things like detective

673
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,340
controls ones that are going to spot the

674
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,840
bad things that are happening and tell

675
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,220
us

676
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,280
now we balance out having a mix of these

677
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,559
preventative and detective controls so

678
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,860
that our ecosystem in this case you know

679
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,620
our pot of Honey is protected in a

680
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,080
layered way so that if one thing fails

681
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,299
so our bear trap doesn't trigger then

682
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,280
we'll spot it quickly and we can trigger

683
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,380
our honey incident response plan okay

684
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm stretching this in altitude far too

685
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,940
thin now so let's carry on

686
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,059
what we're talking to and goodness me I

687
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,740
never thought I'd say this in a talk is

688
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,860
zero trust now please don't worry I'm

689
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,539
not here to sell you a magic box that's

690
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,860
going to do zero across I'm not going to

691
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,840
sell you anything in this talk

692
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,940
um zero trust though is the idea of

693
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,220
trusting nothing assuming every element

694
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,200
of your system can be compromised that

695
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,539
nothing is supposed to be there and

696
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,059
acting accordingly now in our bad

697
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,559
situation that means that we don't

698
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,299
assume there won't be a bear now the

699
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,799
likelihood is very low that there is

700
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,000
going to be a bear in your environment

701
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,740
and to be honest it's very low that

702
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,659
chance that the thing you're protecting

703
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,120
is a tub of honey but there is a chance

704
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,360
and if it happened to exist then you

705
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,860
could Implement an environment that

706
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,840
meant I kind of protect against Bears

707
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,140
even if it's very unlikely to happen

708
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,000
and we can choose an application

709
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,820
security to use a range of controls in

710
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,500
our environment as Architects as

711
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,320
software developer Architects to protect

712
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,679
what matters most now distancing in

713
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,779
software is about the layering of these

714
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,480
controls to create barriers between our

715
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,940
sense developments not to stop things

716
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,539
not to slow things down but to ensure

717
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,220
that everything that is there should be

718
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,380
there and that everything that we're

719
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,600
doing we understand and that we validate

720
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
and buy on each occasion

721
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,320
maybe you should be familiar with many

722
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,700
years controls I'm not going to dig deep

723
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,960
into those today

724
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,480
but you can use this slide later as a

725
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,740
reminder so you can go digging into

726
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,120
these things if any of these concepts

727
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,340
are new to you

728
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,919
now this diagram here I really like and

729
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,419
you know why I like it because it comes

730
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,640
from OS but a bit of the oau space you

731
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,220
may not have encountered yet

732
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,860
um this is from the threat assessment

733
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,220
cookbook which is a really amazing group

734
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,900
of

735
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,539
um free to use software design patterns

736
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,120
for security now they've been

737
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,440
contributed to by a range of

738
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,360
organizations and that the or repo is

739
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,260
growing

740
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,779
but what I like about them is that they

741
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,240
outline structures and Architectural

742
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,799
structures that will distance and

743
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,299
separate your components from each other

744
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,520
in logical ways which preserve the

745
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,020
Integra the integrity and functionality

746
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,679
of your system whilst also allowing you

747
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,900
to get the job done and protect things

748
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,880
so and this one here is for payment

749
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,380
system so if any of you are watching you

750
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,880
build Payment Systems along this will

751
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,640
seem very familiar

752
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,400
using these design patterns can be a

753
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,740
really great way for you to start

754
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,299
looking at your architecture and

755
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,100
comparing now I don't mean you need to

756
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,539
have a pretty architecture diagram that

757
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,120
you built in physio I mean draw it on a

758
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,100
whiteboard and look at these design pens

759
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,559
and go okay does this work is this what

760
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,539
I'm doing what I've done that could be

761
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,919
changed

762
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,020
what we're talking about here is threat

763
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,460
assessment threat modeling and we have

764
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,260
some wonderful resources in the OS

765
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,760
community and beyond that you can go

766
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,340
check out on this the idea being is I

767
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,779
want you to give you and your team

768
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,299
permission to bring this to your every

769
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,700
practice I want you to look at the

770
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,500
architecture of your built components

771
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,779
not just the code and the syntax but how

772
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,240
that all fits together in a structured

773
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,860
way now some of the resources you want

774
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,779
to check out after this so OS threat

775
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,760
Dragon it's cute little logos here on

776
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,440
the screen for you now the threat model

777
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
in cookbook that I've just mentioned and

778
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,220
the threat modeling Manifesto which is

779
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,140
not part of OAS but many of the members

780
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,539
overlap all of these are going to give

781
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,460
you a guideline of where to start with

782
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,740
distancing keeping your application

783
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,260
architecture separated and protected

784
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,200
using layered controls to ensure that

785
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,220
one element is protected from another

786
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,720
so how to get started with distance in

787
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,700
your three steps to success so design

788
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,260
for Security even if you think you're

789
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,580
just the software developer I don't

790
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,960
there's such thing as such as the

791
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,940
software developer but you are also an

792
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,860
architect so consider the architect of

793
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,659
how all your components fit together

794
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,240
Embrace zero trust but not in the hypey

795
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,980
way I don't mean going and buying

796
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,179
something please don't go and do that

797
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,460
but embrace it in the way where you're

798
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,260
separating components and that you're

799
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,059
trusting nothing in your architecture so

800
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,279
that you're making and taking steps that

801
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,080
will allow you to make your choices all

802
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,159
the way through

803
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,679
then make architecture a team sport use

804
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,380
the tools provided by oasp and others to

805
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,120
do threat assessments to look at your

806
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,179
architecture in a new light

807
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,000
next up testing now testing should be

808
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,620
Familiar of all of the concepts that

809
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,880
covert has introduced that we already

810
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,919
know about it should be testing

811
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,080
now testing is very important right in

812
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
covert times it told us we were sick it

813
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,679
told us when we were contagious this is

814
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,360
one of again our posters from New

815
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,240
Zealand we had a list of symptoms what

816
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,580
we would look for to know a bad thing

817
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,620
was happening and then a response we

818
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,940
would take in this case go and get a

819
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,980
test and then stay home

820
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,960
so how does this work in our software

821
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,220
development life cycle if we were to

822
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,100
apply the same thinking of covid uh to

823
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,380
our life cycle well firstly we need to

824
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,179
get over the idea that testing only

825
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,460
happens in one place now I haven't done

826
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,960
it as a traditional Circle here because

827
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,960
well you can imagine as a circle but all

828
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,580
of the steps are the same we've been

829
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,200
teaching the same concept now for 20

830
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,100
years

831
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,799
and testing is always listed at the end

832
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,200
and I always find that quite sad because

833
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
I actually think we should be testing

834
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,039
and validating all the way through but I

835
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,179
guess it wouldn't be much of a life

836
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,679
cycle if everything was at every stage

837
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,740
it becomes a bit like the Multiverse so

838
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,960
where can we fit testing in and how does

839
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,260
it work uh to put our entire Global

840
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,820
ecosystem

841
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,500
well the first thing we want to do is

842
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
understand that there are many types of

843
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,100
testing many that were overlooking on

844
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,940
the whole

845
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm not here to talk about penetration

846
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,360
testing today we've talked about that a

847
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,799
lot there are dozens and dozens of talks

848
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,760
out there about the importance of

849
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,200
penetration testing

850
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,720
but to be honest I want us as a

851
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,100
community to make penetration testers

852
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,960
work really really hard I want to make

853
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,120
them quite upset uh to pen testers who

854
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,340
are watching I'm really sorry about that

855
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,960
um I love you

856
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,240
what I want us to do is to have done so

857
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,980
much testing before they get involved

858
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,159
that we do make them sweat that they

859
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,620
don't have to look for low-hanging fruit

860
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,480
now we could do this in two ways the

861
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,980
first is vulnerability scanning so the

862
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,080
idea that we look for common signs that

863
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,600
something has gone wrong and we can then

864
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,640
go investigate this further now in

865
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,279
covidland that is the equivalent of you

866
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,899
having to have your temperature checked

867
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,760
when you go into a store which happened

868
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,039
very commonly in New Zealand

869
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,020
and I will having a temperature check

870
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,880
tell you if you have covered absolutely

871
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,220
not but it will tell you're sick because

872
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,600
if it shows you've got a fever there's

873
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,640
something wrong you get a fever when

874
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,399
you're unwell so vulnerability scanning

875
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,020
is the equivalent of getting a

876
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,580
temperature check it's looking for One

877
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,980
symptom that could be linked to many

878
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,840
problems but it's telling you you need

879
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,940
to go investigate further and we can put

880
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,679
vulnerability scanning throughout our

881
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,480
application whether we're scanning the

882
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,039
as built application in our production

883
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,700
environments or with the scanning in the

884
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,419
build pipeline as part of our CI CD

885
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,399
the other side of this is automated

886
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,860
testing so where vulnerability scanning

887
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,720
is looking for symptoms that could mean

888
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,700
you have a vulnerability automated

889
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,799
testing is looking for a very specific

890
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,440
combination of symptoms that could

891
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,840
confirm a very specific issue now it

892
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
takes a lot longer you know running a

893
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,500
vulnerability scanner is find a tool put

894
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,539
it into your life cycle hit go deal with

895
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,279
the report do a little bit of tuning but

896
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,020
automated testing requires us to write

897
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,880
tests

898
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,980
now in the curved world this is our PCR

899
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,799
test Tessa I write tests but in our

900
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,760
software world that's something

901
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,320
different

902
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,940
these are tests that we could run

903
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,039
manually so if you have not embraced

904
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,960
automation testing yet I'm not judging I

905
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,340
know that happens

906
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,580
but you could build manual tests or run

907
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,220
tools that check your packages for

908
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,720
common security vulnerabilities you

909
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,480
could do that today you could build a

910
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,039
separate testing Pipeline and build

911
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,440
automation tests that run alongside your

912
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
main cicd pipeline right now

913
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,340
or you could integrate them into your

914
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,799
pipeline so if alongside you writing

915
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,299
your functional unit tests for example

916
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,360
if you're in the Java space or junit

917
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,880
you could write security tests alongside

918
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,220
now there's been some amazing talks on

919
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,779
this in fact one of the reasons for this

920
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,220
talk is to kind of draw your attention

921
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,779
to some amazing things that already

922
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:36,179
exist that we're not using in a coherent

923
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:36,899
way

924
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,700
so while there hasn't been massive

925
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,559
adoption of things like bdd security and

926
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,779
Mitten they were a really really good

927
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,480
examples of how we can use automation

928
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,460
testing languages and cucumber style

929
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,659
Frameworks

930
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,000
to hook into security tools and put them

931
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,200
in our life cycle

932
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,419
now admittedly they take a lot longer to

933
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,100
run than some of their standard tests

934
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,299
because they're hooking into big

935
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,580
scanning Frameworks in some cases

936
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,740
but it's an opportunity to put security

937
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,840
testing exactly where it needs to be in

938
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,159
your life cycle and that's frequently

939
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,200
done with every commit

940
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,640
now some of you will be looking at this

941
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,200
going well it's okay I've moved my

942
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,760
testing into a parallel thing because it

943
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,919
was too slow it slowed down my cicd

944
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
Pipeline and so I've had to move it out

945
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,600
and we bring it back in at the end

946
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,120
if that is something you're doing I want

947
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,159
you to make sure that you are really

948
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:24,720
understanding what happens because when

949
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,240
you take testing out to the side in

950
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,740
covert terms it will be the equivalent

951
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,019
of you doing a covert test and then just

952
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,899
going about your business and just okay

953
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,580
I'll wait for the result before I decide

954
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,320
what I do next

955
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,260
now that's not a great idea because in

956
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,700
that period of time between taking a

957
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,080
test and getting the results you could

958
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,700
find out you could actually be

959
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,200
contagious so you're going to spread

960
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,220
harm

961
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,140
when we do parallel testing we do the

962
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,279
same thing

963
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,380
we've taken the test out and we feed the

964
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,419
results back in later which means those

965
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,220
results come back in after the code is

966
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,960
completed in fact in some cases a couple

967
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,100
of weeks after the code has been

968
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,260
completed that's really difficult for

969
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,880
them to go back and revisit that code

970
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,220
you want to take the action straight

971
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,080
away after the test so keeping it

972
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,580
integrated in your pipeline is really

973
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,679
important

974
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,260
when you're choosing a tool for example

975
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,359
a dependency Checker so going back to my

976
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,159
recommendation of using OAS dependency

977
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,080
Checker or any of the many tools that

978
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,119
are available in that space

979
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,739
here's a list of things you want to be

980
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,300
considering does it support the language

981
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,460
and ecosystem you use

982
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,379
what kinds of vulnerabilities can it

983
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,300
detect because not all scanners can find

984
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,440
all things

985
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,359
how accurate is it how many false

986
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,040
positives will it give

987
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,899
does it work with binaries now I'm

988
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,399
asking this very specifically because

989
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,679
there are many of us who have components

990
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,540
in our ecosystem but we only have the

991
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,179
binaries for perhaps it's a binary that

992
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,219
we've inherited or we include because

993
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,320
we're using it as a dependency

994
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,239
does it integrate with your IDE so it

995
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,460
can come close to you how hard is it to

996
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,379
use how painful does it work

997
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,240
continuously or automatically all of

998
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,760
these are super important so again this

999
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
checklist is available afterwards you

1000
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,180
can bring this in whenever you choose a

1001
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,160
new testing tool to make sure it's going

1002
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,859
to fit your circumstances

1003
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,720
so how can you get started with testing

1004
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,060
which is phase three of our approach to

1005
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,240
a Global Security across all of our

1006
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,000
dependencies and a team of 30 million

1007
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,900
firstly automate your dependency

1008
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,940
checking so use OS dependency Checker

1009
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,099
and get that stuck in today

1010
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,720
if you have another tool that's already

1011
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,460
doing this make sure it's turned on make

1012
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,200
sure it's enforcing because I find many

1013
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
many organizations have these in and

1014
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,560
they never get configured properly so go

1015
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,700
check

1016
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,160
consider your legacy projects now the

1017
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,320
problem with automated testing and with

1018
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,480
dependency Checkers is that they only

1019
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,619
run

1020
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:41,760
um if they're integrated into your

1021
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,579
pipeline when the pipeline runs so if

1022
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,900
you know your pipeline doesn't run

1023
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,400
anymore because that software is under

1024
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,920
under active development then figure out

1025
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,540
what you're going to do about that

1026
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,280
make sure that you're building it

1027
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,859
occasionally or find out alternative

1028
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,260
methods for you to consider and look at

1029
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,420
your legacy projects while the code in

1030
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,859
your legacy projects may not have

1031
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,660
changed and therefore it's going to do

1032
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,579
the same thing you did at the start the

1033
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,680
attack ecosystem is changing all the

1034
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,960
time and so it's important we revisit

1035
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,119
and old tools with new eyes when we

1036
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,640
understand about new tactics for attack

1037
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,440
or new vulnerabilities that have been

1038
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,579
found

1039
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,400
finally make it break so there's no

1040
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,960
point in running a vulnerability scanner

1041
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,880
or automated testing if you're not going

1042
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,099
to listen to the results so make sure

1043
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,020
your testing has the power to break your

1044
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,760
build and if you know that you've been

1045
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,440
putting exceptions in place and just

1046
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,000
going well I'll come back to that later

1047
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,980
stop

1048
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,040
take a breath and let it break because

1049
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,839
it's really importantly fixing these

1050
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,800
things one small low no low criticality

1051
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,079
issue combined with many other low

1052
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
criticality issues very quickly becomes

1053
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,700
a serious problem so make it break and

1054
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,680
fix them now rather than saving it up

1055
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,359
for a lot of work later

1056
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,420
next up prevention step four of our

1057
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,119
approach to the team of 30 million

1058
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,400
so again with our lovely posters now I'm

1059
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,300
going to call out the artists are

1060
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,440
involved in these I thought they were

1061
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,760
nice to wander around if you're going to

1062
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,079
have posters everywhere at least they're

1063
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,700
friendly

1064
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,700
prevention is really important now

1065
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,079
prevention and covert is about

1066
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,520
vaccination I'm not here to talk to you

1067
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,440
about that but that's what it looked

1068
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
like

1069
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,260
prevention and software though is

1070
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,160
something completely different

1071
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,579
prevention in software is about updating

1072
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,140
and patching now

1073
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,060
I'm not here to tread the world

1074
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,859
traveling ground if you should pack your

1075
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,359
stuff and you should patch it regularly

1076
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,820
you know this we know this but if you

1077
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,980
were to raise your hand right now if you

1078
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,380
had a package in your ecosystem that you

1079
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,760
knew was out of date that you're still

1080
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,859
using I'm certain that almost everyone

1081
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,780
who watches this talk would say yes to

1082
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,700
that at some point

1083
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,560
and that's because there's many reasons

1084
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,180
why that happens and it's not just

1085
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,400
laziness sometimes it's laziness but

1086
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,440
mostly it's not let's talk about some

1087
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,820
reasons why that happens and why

1088
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,240
prevention is more than just patching

1089
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,359
so there are three common scenarios

1090
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,040
where we can't update her libraries

1091
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,780
where it becomes difficult firstly it's

1092
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,099
a legacy project

1093
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,859
they may not make libraries and patches

1094
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,660
for your system anymore

1095
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,160
um I work with a range of organizations

1096
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,140
all around the world from giant Banks to

1097
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,260
Tiny non-profits and many of them use

1098
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,599
software but there's nobody around that

1099
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,640
supports it anymore in some cases those

1100
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,480
coders those developers are long retired

1101
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,339
so we can't just go in and patch that

1102
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,339
stuff because this system is fragile it

1103
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,500
is vulnerable in a different way

1104
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,720
sometimes we can't update because well

1105
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,940
security changes aren't put in on their

1106
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,920
own in a patch update often they're

1107
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,079
bundled with functional updates so while

1108
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,700
you may want to fix the vulnerability in

1109
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,619
the code you don't necessarily want to

1110
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,599
inherit all of the changes functionality

1111
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,400
it's going to bring with you and we call

1112
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,440
that a breaking change so what do we do

1113
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,160
then

1114
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,380
because you can't suddenly miraculously

1115
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,240
make your team available to do two weeks

1116
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,560
of work just because you need a security

1117
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,940
update

1118
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,560
it could be there's no patch available

1119
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,920
now it's unusual and patches do come

1120
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,420
with time but if you're using an open

1121
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,980
source library or framework that hasn't

1122
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,560
got a big population or that is not

1123
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,420
particularly security experience and I

1124
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,700
say that with no judgment at all then

1125
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,920
there might not be some patches that are

1126
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,619
available some time

1127
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,540
we have to have a plan as a community

1128
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,839
for what we can do when we can't patch

1129
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,640
now this is the equivalent of my

1130
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,859
situation at home I care for an 80 year

1131
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,200
old she's very very vulnerable and so

1132
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,700
getting things like vaccinations for us

1133
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,680
is difficult because she has many

1134
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,119
conditions that makes that a little bit

1135
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,220
more challenging

1136
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,440
we had to have a plan as a family how do

1137
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,540
we protect her when she can't be

1138
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,180
protected in typical ways

1139
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,940
same in software how do we do this well

1140
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,680
we start identifying the projects and

1141
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,940
the libraries that we know we can't

1142
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,760
update easily and we have a plan we do

1143
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,920
something else instead

1144
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,560
so what are our options well we can fork

1145
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,900
and fix so if it's an open source piece

1146
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,280
of software you take it you fix it

1147
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,960
yourself put it in place

1148
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,180
the problem with this is that you've now

1149
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,760
created another problem for yourself

1150
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,020
you've taken this outside of the

1151
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,619
ecosystem and is now in a space whereby

1152
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,859
it is not going to be able to get

1153
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:17,460
updates from the main trunk now that's a

1154
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,599
problem right because you might have

1155
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,859
solved one problem but you're now going

1156
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,720
to inherit more later you've taken

1157
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,460
long-term ownership of that piece of

1158
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,240
code

1159
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,460
now ideally we would all contribute back

1160
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,260
and we'd all push that Upstream to the

1161
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,240
open source project but there's many

1162
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,859
organizations that don't let us do it if

1163
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,180
you know your organization is one of

1164
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,740
those then perhaps that's something you

1165
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,780
can go and push with after this talk go

1166
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,280
and ask if you can push changes back

1167
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,540
Upstream

1168
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,940
we could ignore it yellow what's the

1169
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,800
worst that could happen no please don't

1170
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,220
do this this is a terrible idea

1171
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,740
but we could and many people will do

1172
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,079
or we could change Library

1173
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,760
you know let's just choose something

1174
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,099
else if we know there's a problem in

1175
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,320
react let's choose angular if we know

1176
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,540
there's a problem in Java oh let's

1177
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,280
become.net developers so that's a bit

1178
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,500
extreme let's not do that but we could

1179
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,960
do now the problem with changing library

1180
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,480
in this way is a solution to a problem

1181
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,599
with vulnerabilities is that we have not

1182
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,220
necessarily solved the problem we may

1183
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,200
have just inherited new problems as a

1184
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,319
result

1185
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,940
we inherit problems in this situation

1186
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,220
such as key person risk so for example

1187
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,540
if you're moving from an established

1188
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,280
technology which has had a string of

1189
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,480
vulnerability so for example you're

1190
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,579
moving from a WordPress project to use

1191
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,220
something home built yes WordPress has a

1192
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,599
lot of vulnerabilities but there's a lot

1193
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,980
of people in the world that understand

1194
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,740
how to keep WordPress safe if you move

1195
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,240
to your own custom stack or something

1196
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,240
more obscure or Edge case you might find

1197
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,500
there's very few people who can help you

1198
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,000
with that and so this is a trade-off

1199
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,099
here when we're protecting libraries

1200
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,960
that cannot be patched and we decide

1201
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,000
well instead of using that I can't patch

1202
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,680
it I'll choose something else you might

1203
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,440
introduce a human risk I want you to

1204
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,000
reduce human Risk by letting people have

1205
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,220
holidays let them have time off don't

1206
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,540
change your libraries to Technologies

1207
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,800
nobody else can support it's going to

1208
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,280
hurt you later

1209
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,040
so how are we going to do this we're

1210
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,560
going to look at edge cases find all of

1211
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,839
the components in your architecture that

1212
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,820
you don't build that you don't have the

1213
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,800
source code for that were written by an

1214
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,960
intern in 2006 and nobody knows where

1215
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,640
that code went

1216
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,460
find the things you can't fix because

1217
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,579
with github's dependabot or any

1218
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,099
automated patching tool because there's

1219
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,079
going to be lots of them out there our

1220
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,940
current modern tooling is built for the

1221
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,800
top five percent of applications who can

1222
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,800
run it the rest of us we have a lot of

1223
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,380
other challenges to find your edge cases

1224
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,060
and know what you're going to do whether

1225
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,140
it's you're going to fork and fix

1226
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,700
something whether you're going to ignore

1227
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,140
it whether you're going to layer some

1228
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,400
other controls and go back to our

1229
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,440
distancing approach whether you're going

1230
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,780
to monitor really really closely

1231
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,599
you have to do something

1232
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,640
so here's your top three things you can

1233
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,560
go and do straight after this talk so

1234
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,540
you can define a patching policy Define

1235
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,640
it very concisely and preferably as code

1236
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,520
now defining its code is a step forward

1237
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,280
for many of us but you can do this and

1238
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,260
set your containerization set your

1239
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,480
infrastructure to have patching built

1240
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,000
into its Cadence set it in your build

1241
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,740
pipelines to automatically build and

1242
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,200
Patch if you can do that automate it

1243
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,940
where you can because people like us

1244
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,520
were busy and we're going to forget so

1245
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,660
make sure that you don't take any

1246
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,400
chances and risks make sure that your

1247
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,900
automation will do it for you when you

1248
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,800
can't

1249
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,859
and the most important of all I want to

1250
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,839
talk more about the software that we

1251
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,240
cannot patch the software that we can't

1252
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,460
use modern dependency Checkers on the

1253
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,859
software that lives deep down inside our

1254
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,560
ecosystems that is underpinning what we

1255
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,599
do and let's make a plan for that

1256
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,079
because it's exceptionally important

1257
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,660
so finally

1258
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,359
response now in covert response we had

1259
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,220
isolation you went home you stayed home

1260
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,740
till you were better you took a test

1261
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,619
now you might also be no uh notice that

1262
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,359
we have other incident response plans we

1263
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,980
see day to day so this one I've taken

1264
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,560
from our New Zealand um you're used to

1265
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,180
seeing incident response plans in all

1266
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,920
parts of your life but incident response

1267
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,380
and security often just lives in the

1268
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,359
security team

1269
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,520
I want us to move past incident

1270
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,319
responses being just in the core network

1271
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,359
security team or in your Global Security

1272
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,760
team to being a repeatable process

1273
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,500
wherever you are in the organization for

1274
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,480
assessing and responding to unseen or

1275
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,579
unexpected events

1276
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,619
now I want us to start building

1277
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,200
application security and application

1278
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,359
development incident response plans I'm

1279
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,040
going to explain why

1280
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,020
instant response is just a repeatable

1281
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,579
set of steps that we do every time

1282
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,560
something bad happens it's nothing fancy

1283
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,660
it starts with identifying as a problem

1284
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,339
so how did you know that about things

1285
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,040
happened verifying that it is indeed a

1286
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,319
problem containing it so it can't spread

1287
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,260
and then responding to fix it so in

1288
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,819
covert that would have been identifying

1289
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,819
it I have a fever I feel unwell

1290
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:01,140
verifying it taking a test to confirm

1291
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,720
that containing it by staying home and

1292
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,520
responding to it by treating the

1293
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,319
symptoms of having a fever and staying

1294
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,540
there until you get a clean test in your

1295
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,920
verification stage and then you go about

1296
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,300
your business

1297
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,460
so why do we need to do this in

1298
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,020
application development

1299
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,940
well there are situations in application

1300
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,859
development that will not fit into your

1301
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,740
organization's response plan for example

1302
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,740
what if there was a scenario where an

1303
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,000
account has been compromised in your

1304
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,040
application that could be through a

1305
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,480
technical vulnerability like SQL

1306
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,740
injection or it could be an account

1307
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,420
compromise like password guessing a

1308
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,940
brute forcing credential stuffing

1309
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,000
now in that case you do need to do a few

1310
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,800
things you need to get together a team

1311
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,119
and you need to respond in the

1312
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,579
application security sense now this is

1313
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,839
not something your network team can

1314
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,220
respond to they don't understand it's

1315
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,359
going to be passed straight from the

1316
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,160
people who report it normally in your

1317
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,020
customer success team straight through

1318
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,020
to your developers so they need a plan

1319
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,880
now creating this plan is quite good fun

1320
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,220
if any of you like me a bit of a nerd

1321
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,440
um it's a bit like d d you gather

1322
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,599
together your team you plan for your

1323
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,920
scenario

1324
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,859
you then test your scenario and you

1325
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,480
learn so in the case of our compromise

1326
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,819
password you gather together not just

1327
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,500
people from your application development

1328
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,660
team but security folk perhaps leaving a

1329
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,400
customer success team and you go right

1330
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,260
what's happened well somebody has rung

1331
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,640
in and they've said my accountant and

1332
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,619
compromises are suspicious transactions

1333
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:25,140
and you work through what you would need

1334
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,240
to do as a team what loss would you need

1335
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,680
to find what information do you need to

1336
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,540
have available how do you verify this

1337
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,400
how do you check that's a real thing and

1338
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,680
how bad is it is it one okay or is it

1339
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,480
dozens of accounts has it happened just

1340
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,400
once or hundreds of times and all of

1341
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,480
this is going to help you understand

1342
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,760
what you need to do next

1343
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,160
then we're into containment so do we

1344
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,599
need to look at the individual's account

1345
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,880
cut all access so we need to do it over

1346
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,560
multiple accounts all of this is very

1347
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,240
application specific this is not about

1348
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,460
your network and Beyond so have a plan

1349
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,020
in your team

1350
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,040
next up remediation so do we need to fix

1351
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,560
it is it user error did they choose a

1352
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,060
poor password or a password that they

1353
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,640
used elsewhere or did we let them choose

1354
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,079
a poor password or did our

1355
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,000
authentication system fail

1356
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,099
all of these things have different types

1357
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,079
of outcomes and Remediation efforts so

1358
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,700
document those

1359
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,740
when you run your tests you're in a safe

1360
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,180
way but don't just read the document and

1361
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,040
go oh yeah it looks like a document I

1362
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,780
want you to get together and really walk

1363
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,579
through it get the date you'd need from

1364
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,079
the logs get the conversations going

1365
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,640
customer success and make sure everyone

1366
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,140
knows what they would do in a real thing

1367
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,240
much like when we do a fire drill we

1368
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,520
actually leave the building in an

1369
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,500
instant response test I want you to run

1370
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,780
through the test properly

1371
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,119
and finally learn from it look at your

1372
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,700
plan figure out what you have

1373
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,740
um learned to them from it and then make

1374
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,359
changes to your environment

1375
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,099
so the three things to get started with

1376
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,079
response incident response in this case

1377
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,359
have a documented incident response plan

1378
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,680
now it doesn't need to be a PDF and a

1379
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,880
draw it doesn't need to be fancy if

1380
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,260
you're a Trello organization you really

1381
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,300
love Trello you do it there if you are

1382
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,680
the type of organization who wants to do

1383
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,500
it in markdown in GitHub I don't judge

1384
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,880
wherever you do it whatever works for

1385
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,020
your culture

1386
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,819
test your plan with the real team and

1387
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,800
make it an application development

1388
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,800
security incident response plan so that

1389
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,359
you know what to do for those very

1390
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,220
specific incidents that only affect you

1391
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,140
that you're going to be remediating

1392
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,960
and review your plan frequently choose a

1393
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,819
different scenario each time and run

1394
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,140
through it and then by the end of the

1395
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,819
year you'll have lots of playbooks for

1396
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,500
different types of scenarios that mean

1397
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,660
that when something bad happens you can

1398
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,000
respond quickly identify things verify

1399
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,240
as a problem contain them and remediate

1400
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,400
so we've had five things that we did in

1401
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,020
the pandemic we weren't even realizing

1402
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,420
were the key to us protecting ourselves

1403
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,359
from the software we're connected to

1404
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,460
keeping our distance and protecting

1405
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,960
things from each other in case something

1406
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,060
bad happens

1407
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,700
identifying problems through testing and

1408
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,500
vulnerability scanning prevention

1409
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,780
through patching and prevention through

1410
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,040
protecting those things that cannot be

1411
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,560
patched and responding with an organized

1412
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,619
incident response plan to keep ourselves

1413
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:04,680
safe we have to keep all of us safe and

1414
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,940
that just doesn't mean our team that

1415
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,800
we're in it means all of the software

1416
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,859
that we use every single day

1417
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,560
so my challenge to you it looks like I'm

1418
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,880
perfectly on time because it just can be

1419
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,640
the two minute warning is are you ready

1420
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,960
to join the team of 30 million and do

1421
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,819
you know why that team has to exist well

1422
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:26,400
because in the world right now there are

1423
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,140
30 million software developers but there

1424
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,060
are many many pieces of software

1425
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,380
millions and millions of pieces of

1426
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,660
software and they need every single one

1427
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,940
of us to take care of them because it's

1428
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,920
not about one big organization being the

1429
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,720
two percent of The Cutting Edge of this

1430
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,520
and doing everything they can to protect

1431
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,280
their stuff it's about everyone working

1432
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,319
together so that even those in the least

1433
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,000
mature organizations are tiny

1434
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,560
non-profits they're little high growth

1435
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,540
companies that shop that just got online

1436
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,280
because their business wanted to survive

1437
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,420
in covid

1438
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,700
all of us have to protect each other and

1439
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,079
that means understanding how we connect

1440
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,359
to each other as an ecosystem how our

1441
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,339
software connects to each other and what

1442
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:04,079
happens when that goes wrong so that we

1443
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,359
can protect ourselves in coherent and

1444
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:09,300
cohesive ways so join me in the team of

1445
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,460
13 million take these five steps into

1446
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,319
your world and hopefully we can all be

1447
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,720
safe together

1448
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,280
if you have any questions now's a good

1449
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,680
time the lovely faran will be looking in

1450
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,240
Hoover for that and if not you can

1451
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,280
contact me by email it's up on the

1452
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,660
screen right now you can find me on

1453
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,780
Twitter at lady underscore nerd but

1454
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,280
remember the underscore it's very

1455
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,839
important the other lady nerd doesn't do

1456
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,078
security

1457
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,180
thank you so much uh thank you Laura we

1458
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,040
have a couple of questions on the Q a

1459
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,500
screen I'm gonna shoot that out to you

1460
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,200
so the first question is what's your

1461
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,480
experience with uh automating

1462
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,660
third-party libraries updates developers

1463
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,700
get cold feet in many cases as the

1464
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,779
application might break

1465
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,500
yeah and it's a really good question

1466
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,280
because you know we have like in some

1467
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,079
there are some cases where it's really

1468
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,940
safe to just update you know it's a very

1469
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,280
small patch it's a very small change

1470
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,140
um and if you if it's smaller contained

1471
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,880
then you can feel quite comfortable that

1472
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,440
you can test it significantly enough

1473
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,599
that once you make that change it's fine

1474
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,660
but the problem is that you know you see

1475
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,680
some of the patches come through

1476
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,480
particularly if you say in the maven or

1477
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,040
nougat environments where patches come

1478
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,780
through for very big Frameworks and

1479
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,240
those patches themselves are huge

1480
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,619
um so you're looking at them having to

1481
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,660
review that and try and understand have

1482
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,160
they documented in their changelog

1483
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,359
everything that's going to change in

1484
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:33,300
this how coherently has it been tested

1485
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,819
before it was released no I don't envy

1486
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,200
any of the developers at Microsoft for

1487
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,460
example because when they release a

1488
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,380
patch they have to test it on every

1489
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,819
single version of every piece of

1490
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,440
software it interacts with

1491
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,040
so you know I I feel feel your pain on

1492
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,680
it what I would say is is really

1493
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,900
understanding the scope and scale of the

1494
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,000
patch each time so if that's your litmus

1495
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,260
test how big is the library that's

1496
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,300
changing if it's a node package for

1497
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,220
example and the code is seven lines just

1498
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,720
read the code

1499
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,579
if it's something much much bigger

1500
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:04,200
you're going to need to work with your

1501
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,540
team to add the time into your Sprints

1502
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,119
or to into your workflow really kind of

1503
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,460
dig into where has this changed and how

1504
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,099
confident I am uh that it's something to

1505
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,380
break everything now crudely that could

1506
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,200
come down to diffing the code even if

1507
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,880
the changelog says it does X Y and Z

1508
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,200
just diff it see what changed

1509
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,079
thank you Laura uh the second question

1510
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,059
is more of like a broader question you

1511
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:31,440
might not be able to answer it in a

1512
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,720
one-liner what do you think are the most

1513
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,339
important aspects of a security

1514
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,800
landscape so if you are starting from a

1515
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,660
level zero where should you be starting

1516
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,119
your security hardening first

1517
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,460
absolutely now I'm going to do a bit of

1518
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,920
a plug to some here I'm not commercial

1519
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,260
involved um but there is a white paper

1520
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,119
that I released a little while ago and

1521
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,339
how to do a security roadmap so you can

1522
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,140
get started with that but here's some

1523
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,460
things to start with firstly there's

1524
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,200
some amazing resources to know us that

1525
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,300
you can get started with so go check out

1526
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,859
the application security verification

1527
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:03,839
standard that's going to give you the

1528
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,540
tears of applications and sensitivity of

1529
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,040
risk and a whole set of controls you

1530
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,079
consider even if you just get the level

1531
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,420
one controls in place that's an amazing

1532
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,619
first step

1533
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,480
other thing you can consider is there

1534
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,220
are a number of free checklists and

1535
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,260
maturity models that they can use so I

1536
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,079
always had Sam at the security Assurance

1537
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,000
majority must model

1538
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,119
um but there's also one um if you Google

1539
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,200
for um CTO SAS security checklist there

1540
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,760
is a free checklist out there that can

1541
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,040
give you like a really like step-by-step

1542
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,140
plan of which bits and pieces to put in

1543
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,359
place now outside of those to compress

1544
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,579
what they tell you into some little bits

1545
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,200
to think about firstly

1546
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,180
start the very beginning with protecting

1547
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,680
your accounts one of the most important

1548
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,020
things you can do as an individual and

1549
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,300
as an organization as a developer is

1550
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,740
make sure that you have really good

1551
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,520
password and secret hygiene because even

1552
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,559
if somebody doesn't know you exist your

1553
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,020
resources such as your Cloud hosting

1554
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,780
environment uh access to your code can

1555
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,740
be a really great Avenue for

1556
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,119
compromising other things or for doing

1557
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,339
things like mining Bitcoin so protect

1558
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,359
your accounts multi-factor

1559
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,160
authentication being a must

1560
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,440
get used to reviewing the technology

1561
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,780
You're Building from so not just is it

1562
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,980
the right technology because it does the

1563
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,020
job but is it a good choice for other

1564
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,760
reasons including security

1565
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,819
and also find your community so security

1566
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:26,099
is huge like saying I do security in my

1567
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,540
applications is like saying I'm moving

1568
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,099
to Europe that's that's a lot of things

1569
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,680
to consider so

1570
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,599
find your community and find other

1571
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,980
people who've been along that Journey

1572
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,960
who can share not just what worked

1573
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,460
because that's exciting but not that

1574
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,780
interesting

1575
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,880
um but share what didn't work

1576
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,319
because they're going to tell you the

1577
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:44,760
things they failed at and I've learned

1578
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,680
so much in my career by sharing honestly

1579
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,700
and openly

1580
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,740
what hasn't worked or what did you wish

1581
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,419
you'd done earlier so try those

1582
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,020
uh

1583
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,540
and the next question is uh what do you

1584
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,760
think software developers are missing in

1585
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,500
terms of security knowledge these days

1586
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,059
um I think the size to it I think we we

1587
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:09,240
focus a lot on syntax like every time we

1588
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,980
talk about security we talk a lot about

1589
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,839
things like the hours top 10 it ends up

1590
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:14,460
in syntax here's how to not do

1591
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,200
cross-site scripting he's had to not do

1592
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,960
SQL injection but for me security

1593
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,059
doesn't begin at code it begins at

1594
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,859
having a crazy idea so you know there

1595
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:23,819
are people in the world right now

1596
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,859
literally trying to send people to Mars

1597
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:27,839
it's amazing it's a Sci-Fi feature made

1598
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,760
real but that didn't start with code it

1599
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,740
started with an idea of oh I wonder if I

1600
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,660
could send someone to Mars security

1601
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,940
starts there and I think the most

1602
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,380
important thing that we can do in ltf

1603
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,520
teams and the thing that we don't

1604
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,160
discuss enough is how we can work with

1605
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,339
our product owners uh ux designers uh

1606
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,079
analysts all of those roles in the

1607
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,119
software team to really think about

1608
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,880
security at every single step so are we

1609
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,980
designing our user interface that will

1610
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,200
encourage secure behaviors or actually

1611
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,900
are we encouraging bad behavior are we

1612
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,880
looking at architecture regularly are we

1613
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,460
doing threat assessment are we if we're

1614
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,140
building machine Learning Systems which

1615
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,359
is happening a lot now are we

1616
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,160
considering where the data is coming and

1617
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,780
where our algorithm came from and how we

1618
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,880
can trust those so it's looking beyond

1619
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,920
the syntax which is great and how

1620
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,839
security becomes one of the illites so

1621
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,059
with performance and scalability and

1622
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:20,220
accessibility and usability and how it

1623
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,079
mixes with all of those that's what I

1624
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,119
think we need for our developers so less

1625
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,099
syntax more systems

1626
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:29,520
that makes absolute sense and to the

1627
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,460
last question uh what was the impact of

1628
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,319
covid-19 on cyber security

1629
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,500
I think

1630
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,300
we we were an unusual industry for

1631
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,520
covert 19. so many Industries got really

1632
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,740
hurt by this but you know cyber security

1633
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,599
actually you know we had more to do than

1634
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,579
we've ever had because the threat

1635
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,559
landscape changed and in fact I think

1636
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,059
we'll see that change continue for a

1637
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:55,380
number of years and that's because

1638
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,000
anytime something bad happens in the

1639
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,800
world and there's hardship there will

1640
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,619
always be more instability and crime and

1641
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,140
people doing bad things

1642
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,079
um I think for for me what I saw was a

1643
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,180
lot of companies had to move a lot

1644
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,559
quicker than they were comfortable with

1645
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,200
so they had to make decisions to survive

1646
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,000
so they put technology online that they

1647
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,160
hadn't thought through they acquired

1648
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,480
Technologies and built from things

1649
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,859
they'd never used before because they

1650
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,420
had to do it quicker to support their

1651
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,460
team and that made people very

1652
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,280
uncomfortable it led to risk but also it

1653
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,099
led to Innovation so I think you know

1654
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:31,619
yes we introduced risks and I you know

1655
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:32,880
if you look at the early days of Zoom

1656
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,740
for example there was a lot we learned

1657
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,960
very quickly about the security of um

1658
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,619
online meetings but at the same time

1659
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,760
hundreds of thousands of businesses who

1660
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,099
had not really been into that first and

1661
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,079
now in the cloud and doing business

1662
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,420
online by default and that's wonderful

1663
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,460
so in a way it's been a catalyst for

1664
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,260
some very exciting technology and so for

1665
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,900
security people we're now living in an

1666
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,819
age where some of the Technologies we

1667
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,319
never thought would be built are being

1668
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,480
built and used and so now we can Embrace

1669
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,160
that but we need to just be careful we

1670
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,780
don't burn out as a result of all of

1671
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,099
this rapid change and that we stay

1672
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,079
healthy as this continues for probably

1673
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:09,240
many years to come

1674
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,660
got it thank you

1675
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,280
uh that brings us to the end of q a

1676
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,780
thank you Laura for the great

1677
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,460
presentation this gave us a lot of

1678
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,960
insights and knowledge about security

1679
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,960
landscape and if you have any more

1680
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,700
questions feel free to contact Laura on
