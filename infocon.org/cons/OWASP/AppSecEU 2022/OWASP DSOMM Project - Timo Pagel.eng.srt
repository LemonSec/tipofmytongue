questions you will submit let me

24
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,400
introduce demo Timo has been an I.T

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,340
industry for over 20 years

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,040
after a career as a system administrator

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,260
and web developer he advises customers

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,560
as a devsecopes consultant and trainer

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,740
the focus is on security test automation

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,080
for software and infrastructure and

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,119
evaluation of complex applications in

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,140
the cloud

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,020
in his spare time he teaches web and

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,240
application security at various

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,140
technical colleges welcome Timo we are

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,920
happy to see you here and please over to

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,079
you

38
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,880
thank you for the nice introduction

39
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,398
let me share my screen

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,020
yeah so uh today we will talk about

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,098
measuring uh your security maturity uh

42
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,860
in your team or your organization

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,080
depending on on your role

44
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,840
and the tool for that is the overall

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,180
statistic of maturity model I will start

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,060
with some slides but then we will

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,000
quickly go to the application itself and

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,500
analyze uh how the model is uh presented

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,720
in that application how it can make use

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,239
of the application around it

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,720
quick words about me I'm a devsecops

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
consultant

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,459
and I love open source projects like the

54
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,680
Juice Shop like the testicles of Duty

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
model like the Uber security prints

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,700
project

57
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,940
or a defect dojo and many others and I I

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,760
contribute to them

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,239
so what is the target of maturity models

60
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,959
in general going glass uh presented a

61
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,160
definition which I have slightly

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,620
adjusted here uh but but the base is

63
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,860
from Brian uh so uh the Target or

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,840
maturity models is to analyze current

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,140
software security practices build a

66
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,019
security program in defined iterations

67
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,659
show Progressive Improvement in Secure

68
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,000
practices and Define and measure secure

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,180
related activities

70
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,019
so here is story of what I what I did I

71
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,780
created a plan for the

72
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,319
um for the tests for a company and we

73
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,200
wanted to uh introduce these tests over

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,280
time range of one or two years

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,140
uh from that we have done so far only

76
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,599
one third so that's why it's important

77
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,620
to do it in small iterations

78
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,299
continuously improved because it doesn't

79
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,040
make sense from what I have recognized

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,500
to make a big plan in the start

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,620
all right so as we know now the

82
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,379
definition of maturity models

83
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,620
um uh I would like uh that you fill out

84
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,760
to pull uh the the pull in the app so

85
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,100
that we can figure out how many of you

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,680
are fully aware of your Dev stack of

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,079
maturity how many of you are partially

88
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,259
aware and who is not aware you will find

89
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,400
the poll in the uh app uh on the on the

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,479
right

91
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
please fill it out

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,620
um what I mean by area of influence is

93
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,419
because you depending on your rule your

94
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,000
area of influence might be your team or

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,919
the whole organization or as an

96
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,580
architect often some teams or as a

97
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,340
product owner often you have multiple

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,919
teams so that's why I say area of

99
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,520
influence so in your area of influence

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,580
um are you fully aware of the deficit of

101
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,000
maturity do you have the insights or are

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,380
you partially aware or are you not aware

103
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,340
so far we have answers which are all

104
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,698
partially aware

105
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,300
so that means that you do have some

106
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,900
insights but are not uh not the whole

107
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,940
coverage that is that is a good start

108
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,520
because it means you will be able to

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,500
quickly fill out the second Ops maturity

110
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,199
model to gain even more insights I will

111
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,900
show you in this talk how how to do that

112
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,780
beforehand we need to uh get to know a

113
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,800
bit

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
um the devstick Ops maturity in gen

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,680
material model in general uh so we have

116
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
the devops dimensions uh then we have

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
sub dimensions for these different

118
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,620
dimensions and in the sub Dimensions you

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,940
have multiple levels four levels uh it

120
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,419
starts with maturity one

121
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,600
um and as high as the maturity goes as

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,639
higher is uh the the

123
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
effort of implementation these

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,020
activities or as less are security

125
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,060
benefits is in there maybe you have

126
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,520
other benefits from certain uh

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919
activities uh which are not in the area

128
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
of security but we focus obviously on

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,699
security in the model

130
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,940
these are the different dimensions uh

131
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,500
built and deployment culture and

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,780
organization information gathering

133
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,880
hardening and test and verification

134
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,800
as I said we have uh four maturity

135
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,479
levels

136
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,259
um and level one means that you have a

137
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,240
basic understanding of security level

138
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,699
two means that you have an adoption of

139
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,280
basic security practices level three

140
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,039
means uh that you have a high adoption

141
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,319
of security practices and level four

142
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,740
means that you have advanced deployment

143
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,740
of security practices at scale so that

144
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,340
that are that are uh words here mainly

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,240
it's level one uh you you have a little

146
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,720
security and level four means you have a

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,280
very very high uh security level reached

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,180
now you might ask why are there some

149
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,180
spots White

150
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,900
so these white spots come because uh the

151
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,380
model is created in a way uh where it

152
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,960
makes sense to have activities so when

153
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,940
it doesn't make sense to have here in

154
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,940
application tests for example

155
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,000
um

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,340
activities at level one because you

157
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,440
first have to do other activities at

158
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,419
level one and so you can start with

159
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,300
level two that's why it's white so there

160
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,460
is nothing uh which makes sense in level

161
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,500
two that's why it's white some other

162
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,639
maturity models are are created in a way

163
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,319
that they are very structured they

164
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,180
wouldn't allow such things but I say

165
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,699
it's important uh to focus on the

166
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,919
activities and they are done in the

167
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,539
right order that's why we have white

168
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,819
spots

169
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,639
um these are a simplified view of

170
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,440
dependencies uh which can be across

171
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
different subdimensions

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,099
so on in the build uh subdimension on

173
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,080
level one you have defined build process

174
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
and that is for example the base for all

175
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,580
the different tests we do because in

176
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,219
case the build isn't defined it's very

177
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,880
hard uh to perform static testing

178
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,760
because you need to know where is the

179
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,380
source code checked out during the build

180
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,140
processes that you can Define please my

181
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,060
aesthetic test will test this specific

182
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,360
folder or these specific artifacts but

183
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,740
therefore it needs to be defined where

184
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,320
they are Define build process here means

185
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,420
for example that you have a code it

186
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,000
doesn't need to be documented uh in in

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the word document or a Wiki page it just

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,279
needs to be defined so that you can

189
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,100
reproduce it and mostly you will do this

190
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,260
uh in code in your build server for

191
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,959
example in a Jenkins file or you can

192
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,760
also do it for example in GitHub actions

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,180
or and so on

194
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,420
then on level two on the on the next

195
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,360
that is continuously everyone on in the

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,220
test and verification you have for

197
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,980
example uh the subdimension static depth

198
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,920
and in there uh we have tests of server

199
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,300
side components with normal abilities

200
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,120
when you're very precise this is uh it's

201
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,060
a software composition analyzes uh but

202
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,700
as this doesn't make sense to put it in

203
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,120
a in a in an own sub-dimension it's here

204
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,060
in static nerve and

205
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,920
um this doesn't have more dependencies

206
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
but you can see that the static analysis

207
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,420
for important server-side components

208
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,220
here that

209
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,300
um

210
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,260
um has on level four other uh other

211
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,680
things which depend on the static

212
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,060
analyze ones for important server side

213
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,339
components so that can be for example a

214
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,779
tool like uh find security bugs

215
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,279
um

216
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,100
um and first you just analyze important

217
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,440
components maybe oxidation components

218
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,220
later or safe written components and

219
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,399
afterwards maybe you do rendering that

220
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,140
means that even the open source codes

221
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,380
you pull uh you want to perform static

222
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,180
analysis

223
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,899
um

224
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,600
this is a level four that is very very

225
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,120
high maturity so here you can see that

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,339
level four mostly is something which

227
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,380
you're not targeting mostly you are

228
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,980
targeting level one and level two maybe

229
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,459
some things from Level C uh and and some

230
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,800
activities from level four but your main

231
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,500
target should be to fill out level one

232
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,920
and two

233
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,300
um yeah when you are in case you're a

234
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,640
developer you should start with your own

235
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,860
team

236
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,519
and now as I said as this is uh it

237
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,220
showcase let us take a look at the

238
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,920
application here so

239
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,940
um this is the application

240
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,640
um which has a

241
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
Dimension and the sub Dimension which I

242
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,140
have presented beforehand and the

243
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,779
different uh maturity levels so you can

244
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,540
for example take a look at the dimension

245
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,820
build and deployment then the build and

246
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,440
here we have the defined build process

247
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,420
which we have seen in the slide

248
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,620
beforehand you can hover and get to know

249
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,339
um a brief understanding so it informs

250
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,860
you about the risk when you're not half

251
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,839
a defined pay process and the

252
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,779
opportunity what do you gain when you

253
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,240
have a defined pay process when we click

254
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,000
on it while we are in the metrics we get

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,880
even more information like examples how

256
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,480
you can assess if you have this or not

257
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,600
for example to show your build Pipeline

258
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,040
and

259
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,220
um exemplary a job and then you know

260
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,620
okay is this there or not

261
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,940
um then another way is that you show

262
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,339
that every team member has access to

263
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,480
that paid server uh or and you can also

264
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
provide evidence in a way that uh paying

265
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,459
your jobs are fixed depending on your

266
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,620
scope you might do it for your own for

267
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,760
your team then you don't need to be so

268
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,399
precise these are just helpful in case

269
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
you do it to document your security

270
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,700
maturity for someone else

271
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,360
um

272
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,300
then it might make sense to fully cover

273
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,639
these assessment questions and document

274
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,440
it

275
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,839
in addition we get implementation hints

276
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,959
because this is a very uh yeah this is

277
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,260
an abstract an abstract uh information

278
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,660
here which doesn't go into much detail

279
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,300
sometimes it helps to get two examples

280
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,240
like you can see down here so you have

281
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,060
an example uh and here is these are

282
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,779
mainly hints for for

283
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,720
documentation hence not Tools in this

284
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,100
case

285
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,459
um but I I think you understand that the

286
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,279
tool is often helpful uh when when when

287
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,260
you when you don't understand the

288
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,899
description in addition we get uh yeah

289
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,300
some some metrics about this activity so

290
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,139
is it is it a high value a medium level

291
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,779
value or a low value or even a very high

292
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,240
value or very low value uh how much

293
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,100
knowledge do you need to implement this

294
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,200
how much is the required time to do it

295
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,260
and what are the the resources you need

296
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,800
in addition you have a mapping tour over

297
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,139
Sam here or the over software issues

298
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,380
maturity model and to the

299
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,660
um either so that you can also map to

300
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,240
the iso appendix dimension

301
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,420
um you can scroll through it and see all

302
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,760
the different sub-dimension specific

303
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,839
activities inside

304
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,000
and in the end you get some statistics

305
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,339
of how many activities are there how

306
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,579
many dimensions how many sub-dimensions

307
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,060
are there

308
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,360
um it doesn't make sense in this

309
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,459
presentation to go through all the

310
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,820
different activities but uh we can we

311
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,740
can go through some samples so that you

312
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,959
get an understanding of what is required

313
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,300
in different sub Dimensions so we talked

314
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,000
already about builds in deployment it's

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,579
about the deployment process so nowadays

316
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,560
you define that for example in agricity

317
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,459
or other two words so that means Define

318
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,440
deployment process then we have patch

319
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
management you might utilize a tool like

320
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,980
Dependable renovate to automate pull

321
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,680
requests to the dismant here and by

322
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,720
having this automated pull requests you

323
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,060
should Define a policy how fast should

324
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,459
these different open pull requests

325
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,800
getting merged maybe you take in count

326
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,260
uh take into account that there is a

327
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,420
security flag or not which highlights

328
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,040
that there is a vulnerability which is

329
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,220
getting fixed and so on then in the

330
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,260
design phase we are talking mainly about

331
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,959
thread modeling and how to evolve threat

332
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,600
modeling

333
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,940
in the education

334
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,519
[Music]

335
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,380
um

336
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,839
sub-dimension uh it's about training and

337
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,480
how you enhance the culture

338
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,339
um so it's very important that there's

339
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,740
not one architect in a big organization

340
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,560
it should be in a way that the architect

341
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,899
has different satellites in the team

342
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,120
called security Champions or security

343
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,639
ambassadors and that is what this

344
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,120
educational guidance is about then we

345
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,579
have process where it's about how you

346
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,100
can shift to the right

347
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,600
um so what are the things the activities

348
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,639
you have to do on the right like you you

349
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,000
get an idea about how critical are the

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,220
applications which you're having what

351
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,040
are the plans you are having in mind

352
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,760
when you're having prepared when uh for

353
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,880
example a system is not available

354
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,420
then application hardening uh here yeah

355
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,079
I make my life very easy here uh because

356
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,959
uh the decent references here over to

357
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,259
other maturity models which is

358
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,079
um the application security verification

359
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,920
standard and the mobile application

360
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,839
security

361
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,940
verification standard so when you want

362
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,180
to take the box here that you have these

363
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,800
implemented

364
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,959
um then you will need to follow these

365
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,800
both standards

366
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,140
then we come to development and Source

367
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,599
control where it's about how do you use

368
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,819
the version control system and the first

369
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,679
question is are you using a Version

370
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,559
Control System uh because that is not

371
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,540
always there sometimes people are in a

372
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,599
low maturity are working with folders to

373
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,179
to perform versioning that is not what I

374
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,559
mean with versioning so this is just

375
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,059
something like it

376
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,599
all right then we come to infrastructure

377
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,460
hardening

378
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,700
um so for example in these modern

379
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,299
environments here every uh every small

380
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,460
system like a container might be able to

381
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,460
talk with other containers in the system

382
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,080
or in the cluster and that is something

383
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,660
which we don't want and this is called

384
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,280
isolated networks for virtual

385
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,620
environments because uh one when you

386
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,940
take a look at this model it's not

387
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,940
defined if you're using a cluster or if

388
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,620
you're using

389
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,140
um playing Docker installation or if

390
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,760
you're using virtual machine so that's

391
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,880
why I try to abstract it a bit but I try

392
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
to be as close as possible at the doing

393
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,500
then we come to logging so in the

394
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,020
logging we it's it's about how is there

395
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,020
a centralized logging and

396
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,960
um is it visualized is it in in time and

397
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,220
so on then monitoring is about the

398
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,600
um

399
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,299
the monitoring of your applications but

400
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,880
uh as you know when you're working with

401
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,220
AWS for example mostly it's recommended

402
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,860
to also create metrics for budget so

403
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,020
when you're you you estimate your budget

404
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,299
for a month and when uh you could create

405
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,660
a threshold and then you inform yourself

406
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,640
uh with alerts that you're over that

407
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,039
budget for example so that is the first

408
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,840
thing which is mostly recommended all

409
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,700
that you have simple application and

410
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,320
system metrics

411
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,679
application tests these are tests which

412
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,380
you create with junit for example so

413
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,520
unit tests acceptance tests and so on

414
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,240
but with a security Focus obviously so

415
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,940
when you're doing tests uh some people

416
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,880
might uh want to to tick the box here

417
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,220
and say yeah I have unit tests but the

418
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,559
question is do you have it focused on

419
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,860
security for example what are the first

420
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,620
tests I would Implement are I would

421
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,380
Implement are

422
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,020
tests for your authorization Frameworks

423
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,140
so that you test for this endpoint I

424
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,840
would like when this input happens that

425
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,539
it's authorized and when this input

426
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,120
happens that it's not authorized so that

427
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,980
are things uh which you do in the

428
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,120
application test then we have

429
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,220
consolidation that's very interesting

430
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,660
here because we have a lot of different

431
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,200
tests we can perform and what you should

432
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,900
question yourself is how do you want to

433
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,059
handle for its positive how do you want

434
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,460
to have the process when you are

435
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,640
uh want to accept a finding for example

436
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
in normal abilities there might not be a

437
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,000
patch right now but you expect it in

438
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,799
five days so how do you want to accept

439
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,900
this so that it you're not getting

440
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,260
alerted again so in in devsec in devops

441
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,580
we want to have everything automated

442
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,440
that means also the test cases are

443
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,960
automated uh and when you have these

444
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,059
tests running let's say every day you

445
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,500
don't want to get informed about the

446
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,179
same vulnerability you took a long a

447
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,640
look at yesterday so you need something

448
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,980
to handle that and here comes the

449
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,780
question do you want to handle it in the

450
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,500
tool itself or are you already planning

451
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,620
to have multiple tools then it's highly

452
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,500
recommended uh to jump directly to level

453
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,419
three and utilize the vulnerability

454
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,679
management system

455
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,780
but when you know you only want to have

456
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,200
one or two different test tools then you

457
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,740
might uh just use the the the

458
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,539
capabilities of their tools and then

459
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,460
down here we come to even more different

460
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,580
tests uh and that you have to adjust it

461
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,020
based on the test intensity

462
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,520
then we come to our implementation

463
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,100
levels here you have the option to

464
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,320
Simply click on the activities to mark

465
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,900
that you have implemented or to mark

466
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,240
that you haven't implemented so mostly

467
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,760
you start with a white metrics and then

468
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,740
you go through uh these different

469
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,080
dimensions as I said I recommend to go

470
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,760
first through level one and two and

471
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,179
don't take a lock so much at level three

472
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,100
um because you will I also I already

473
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,799
Identify some uh mostly you will

474
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,679
identify some missing things so it's

475
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,840
recommended first fill out completely

476
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,600
level one and then two sometimes you

477
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,720
want to adjust the model because there

478
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,520
are a lot of different tests here which

479
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,220
you can perform and for One customer for

480
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,799
example we defined that we don't want to

481
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,900
perform Dynamic tests at all because

482
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,600
they are very uh expensive to implement

483
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,240
and

484
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,460
um that means that we say okay these is

485
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,799
not part of our deficit of security

486
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,419
model in that organization but all the

487
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,360
other things we kept so uh that we just

488
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,360
have uh what I do in that case is to

489
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
mark this here it's great for example

490
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,340
completely are you open and just

491
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,799
mark this series as gray

492
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
um and these ones also and then everyone

493
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,179
knows okay we are not focusing on that

494
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,360
in addition I might also go to level uh

495
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,280
forward level three the mark of that

496
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,860
also sqa is not planned right now

497
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,600
because we want to focus on level two

498
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,980
and level one

499
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,539
by creating uh the model when you want

500
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,940
to adjust it it's also important to take

501
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,880
in mind the ease and the value of

502
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,280
implementation and then you can take a

503
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,299
look here at the different sub

504
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,159
dimensions and take a look at the

505
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,039
different activities in here we also

506
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,919
have mappings

507
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,940
uh mappings to Sam and ISO as I told you

508
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
beforehand in one activity but mostly

509
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,840
when you want to have the mappings you

510
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,880
would like to see it all at once so this

511
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,799
is what this page here is for you can

512
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,600
say okay I would like to only show the

513
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,480
performed activities and then you get

514
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,740
here the mapping to these different uh

515
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,440
to Sam and ISO through the activities

516
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,020
you actually have implemented the Chief

517
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,760
Information Security Officer it might be

518
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,159
very

519
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,919
interested in these in addition uh you

520
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,200
can get a full reports or all the

521
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,059
different things which are described in

522
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,720
the uh in the activities are shown here

523
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,360
uh yes so that you can kind of print it

524
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,919
and give it to an auditor in case you

525
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,220
want to uh we have a page for the usage

526
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,919
so how do you use it actually there is

527
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,620
kind of a level a zero some free

528
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,659
requirements are there for example that

529
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,620
you uh there's a product owner I do have

530
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,620
the buy-in to do it that the upper lab

531
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,559
management uh also wants to create such

532
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,900
a maturity model and stick to it and

533
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,140
improve continuously improve

534
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,900
um yeah in addition to this talk uh here

535
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,659
today you see that uh in the readme of

536
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,360
the project there are a lot of different

537
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,799
uh links with the different points of

538
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,159
different points are in the focus

539
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,480
um

540
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
yeah and the last thing I would like to

541
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
tell you is where you can find the model

542
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,880
uh it's in on GitHub and you can easily

543
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,480
so take a look uh here in the GitHub

544
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,080
repository

545
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,240
yeah thank you uh maybe maybe one last

546
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,400
word for the conclusion so it's very

547
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,380
important that you start just start with

548
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,200
your area of influence and uh go through

549
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,299
the model click the boxes where you the

550
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,500
activities where you think you have

551
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,120
implemented it

552
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,159
um and then plan your next step for

553
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,780
example for the next three months what

554
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,100
do you want to implement in the next

555
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,580
three months don't uh take too much just

556
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,559
one activity that will be enough for

557
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,760
three months

558
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,620
thank you

559
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,900
thank you very much Timo it was perfect

560
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,700
that's very interesting and a lot of

561
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,240
information just 25 minutes thank you so

562
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,220
the first question that I have is it it

563
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,279
is obvious that there is an overlap with

564
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,220
a wasp sum in certain areas are you

565
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,400
actively trying to align or difference

566
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,919
differentiate content with the sum

567
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,840
focusing on technical aspects of Dev

568
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,880
secops instead of mixing application

569
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,340
security aspects might be a good

570
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,539
complementary Way Forward

571
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,779
uh so so the first question was related

572
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,640
to what is the difference between Sam

573
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,000
and Diesel right and the overlap yeah so

574
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,279
yeah are you actually trying to align or

575
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,740
differentiate content with the sum and

576
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,280
uh yeah yeah I

577
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,389
[Music]

578
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,919
activities to Sam

579
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,679
um and that means when you perform a Sam

580
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,600
assessment you get a very broad

581
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,520
description of what you have to

582
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,860
implement for example in when you when

583
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,900
you go to Sam they say please do Dynamic

584
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,340
application security testing but they

585
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,679
don't tell you exactly how you can do it

586
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,779
how you can evolve and that is what you

587
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,820
can see here so in the first step you

588
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,860
just perform a simple scan to get to

589
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,960
know these Dynamic testing tools and

590
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,840
then you enhance the coverage and

591
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,140
um maybe the intensity of the tool so

592
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,260
you you get to improve

593
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,880
um so that is I would say the difference

594
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,940
you you get here more fine granular view

595
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,520
that means it also takes more time to

596
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,200
perform the assessment and want to in

597
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,179
case you want to go through level one to

598
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,580
level four but as I said it's easy to

599
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,740
just do level one and two first and then

600
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,600
later you think about level three and

601
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,980
four

602
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,539
um I would say also the focus is

603
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,820
different uh why you you I would perform

604
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,120
a Sam assessment to convince management

605
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,880
I would perform a a decent assessment

606
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,419
when it's more related to technical uh

607
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,760
to the technical people who also want to

608
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,679
implement it afterwards because then you

609
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,220
can more find more fine granularly use

610
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,380
it also you could create a base model

611
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,260
this decent which will be hard with uh

612
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,460
with the Sam itself

613
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,900
very good thank you very much great

614
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,179
answer and another question

615
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,360
I heard uh DSO participate in the Google

616
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,539
summer of code what the student is doing

617
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,820
there

618
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,679
uh yeah if you have a student uh iron

619
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,520
Prasad uh he is redeveloping uh this

620
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,840
whole application this is a bit old

621
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,400
school right I developed it during my

622
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,679
Master's thesis uh it's written a PHP

623
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,500
completely uh now we will get uh in

624
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,080
angular application

625
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,120
he will create an angry application for

626
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,320
it so in case you use this uh this uh UI

627
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,480
and identify

628
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
um features you would like to have and

629
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,159
now is the right time to create an issue

630
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,620
so that we can we can think about if we

631
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,639
want to put it in the backlog

632
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,880
sounds great that's that's perfect uh so

633
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,580
I hope people can also contact you and

634
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,419
ask more questions if it's uh there is

635
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,520
any relevant questions about the topics

636
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,380
that you've shared right it's you are

637
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,500
open to uh to have more questions after

638
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,740
presentation is that fine yeah great

639
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,900
thank you Timo it was very good very

640
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,299
interesting and we had questions and

641
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,000
thank you for participation and being a

642
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,240
great speaker and uh thank you for your

643
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,419
questions and that's finishing our today

644
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,080
presentation uh please check agenda and

645
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,539
move to the any other presentation you

646
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,159
are interested in but now we are moving

647
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,720
to launch Expo
