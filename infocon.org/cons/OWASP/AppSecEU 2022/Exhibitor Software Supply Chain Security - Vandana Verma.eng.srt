uh

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,100
one uh Verma would you over to you

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,640

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
thank you so much let me just go ahead

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,579
and share my screen

33
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,079
and we can get started

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,939
now before I share my screen I have a

35
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,560
question for everyone

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
how many of you are aware about Supply

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,399
chains

38
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,520
I think a lot of you because when we are

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,200
at ovas conference

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,079
that's something which is very very

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,820
important

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,939
and uh it's something becoming very very

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,479
big when we are talking about issues

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,580
that are spanning across

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,900
now the point comes how exactly do we

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,160
deal with them

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,980
how exactly

48
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,260
these things are changing the scenarios

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,319
and on top of it the most important

50
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,760
thing comes is

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,819
do we even want to talk about them

52
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,700
or how do we want to talk about them

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,760
so today in the talk I would be covering

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,459
that some aspects

55
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,260
which I understand

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,840
which I've seen come across I am sure

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,300
there are many more things

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,480
that you have you are coming across and

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
you want to share with me I would love

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,180
to have your feedback after the session

61
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,400
I would love to understand from you what

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,819
are the questions which actually create

63
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,300
a lot of issues and how exactly I can

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,440
help

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,800
so today's talk is all about supply

66
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,260
chain risks which are actually trying to

67
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,300
impact everyone

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,760
a little bit about myself I am a

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,040

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
and uh

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,599
when I'm not working at sneak I am

72
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,000
actually contributing to our very lovely

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
Community oasp which is open web

74
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,860
application security project and we are

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,620
talking at the conference today

76
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,440
um I am actually serving as a chair

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,739
and I can proudly say that I am first

78

comfortable and my email address is

87
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,940
there on the website if you go to

88
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,080
obas.org and start learning checking out

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,720
board members you would be able to find

90
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,159
that

91
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,340
now coming back to the topic

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,100
we talk about futuristic things

93
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,500
and this is what we feel is a futuristic

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,419
image of something we really want

95
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,120
but while we are dealing with it the

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,639
most important thing comes is that are

97
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,820
we uploading some so are we seeing there

98
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,560
is a data which is getting uploaded

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
somewhere or

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,300
are there any things which are

101
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,880
uh impacting our devices

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,520
there are times where we've come across

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,919
that while there is some software

104
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,780
getting downloaded the data getting

105
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,120
stored in Cloud which is accessible to a

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
lot of people who should not have access

107
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,020
to it

108
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,960
so it's important to understand or what

109
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,160
will happen

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,120
everything that we do would be tracking

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,780
now when the tracking happens

112
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,780
do you want your child uh to be

113
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,380
monitored or do you think that anything

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,500
that you speak at home

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,180
anyone can hear it or for that matter

116
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,479
your neighbor can hear it no we do not

117
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,860
want that

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,100
but the most important comes is that

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,860
in this journey developers play a very

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,960
very big role

121
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
the whole supply chain attack system or

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
landscape

123
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,160
is actually very very big

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,460
it is so big that these attacks are

125
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,180
coming in and we are fizzling there are

126
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,300
times wherein we do not understand how

127
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,720
exactly we should react to these attacks

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,660
and when you are at this talk I am sure

129
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,780
you all care about software security and

130
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,080
that's why we are discussing it

131
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,360
now have you ever thought developers can

132
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,460
be a malware distribution system

133
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,139
I did not

134
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,900
so these incidents like event stream

135
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,259
incident which happened in 2018

136
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,060
where there was a back door which was

137
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,639
implemented or which was part of a

138
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,539
package

139
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,080
and everyone was using it and executing

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,560
it and there was Bitcoin miner

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,160
um or a a script which is stealing the

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
Bitcoins

143
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,100
no

144
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,160
think of it wherein this package is

145
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,800
started in 2011.

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,280
over the period of seven eight years

147
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,220
people got busy people wanted to help

148
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,199
out now

149
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,060
where the volunteers wanted to help out

150
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,979
it's such a good thing

151
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,199
now most important thing comes is that

152
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,639
we vet when we Implement anything

153
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,220
here in this case it was a little Miss

154
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,860
on that now

155
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,639
if you think of as dependencies

156
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,100
that how much do we really know about

157
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,300
them

158
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,960
how much do we know about our own app

159
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,380
for me if I have developed my own app on

160
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,620
open source like my literally my app is

161
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,960
on open source ecosystem

162
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,139
so how much do we do I know about it I

163
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,000
think this is my app

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,400
but actually this is the app that I have

165
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,919
wherein my code is just a little Dot

166
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,039
but rest other thing is actually open

167
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,699
source as per the research done by a lot

168
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,979
of organizations

169
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,860
there's an imp there's a saying 80 to 90

170
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,080
percent of the code

171
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,060
on the internet

172
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,740
is open source

173
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,000
now when when the research says that

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
think of

175
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,620
how much do we understand that like just

176
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,680
10 code or 20 code we are writing rest

177
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,599
is all open source

178
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,819
how crazy that is

179
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,340
it brings us to the point of this

180
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,199
understanding the state of open source

181
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,580
security

182
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,300
but let me take this example wherein

183
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,060
this particular vulnerability if you see

184
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,639
the Java markdown parts are

185
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,759
vulnerability which was actually

186
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,099
reported in 2015.

187
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,139
it took one year to fix that

188
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,799
vulnerability even more than one year

189
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,080
so are we not vulnerable

190
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,200
we are and on top of it

191
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,539
these kind of creatures

192
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,760
they actually keep us awake

193
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,120
Equifax Equifax breach happen like ages

194
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,060
ago we're still talking about it Equifax

195
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,399
has come back more stronger

196
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,580
but again the point comes is that

197
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,740
third party libraries third-party

198
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,000
dependencies

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,540
are actually creating Havoc

200
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,580
but they are useful

201
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,060
can we deny the fact that we took we

202
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,860
cannot use or we would not use open

203
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,260
source in future we can never deny that

204
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,060
we are at a community event which is all

205
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,740
about open

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,880
now it also brings us to the point

207
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,920
are there any open source tools which

208
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,660
are available

209
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,959
absolutely there are tons of Open Source

210
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,800
tools available by ovasp itself you just

211
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,100
need to go to obas.org go to projects

212
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,980
there are wonderful projects

213
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,360
so when I started with obasp I knew that

214
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
it's only or maybe my understanding was

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
just that

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,339
wasp is top 10 or a testing guide but

217
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,440
over the period I realized it's much

218
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,899
more than that there are incredible

219
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,040
projects

220
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
which are there

221
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,080
then there are so many projects which

222
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
are documentation projects

223
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,880
then tooling then what not lab project

224
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,300
so all of these projects actually can

225
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,580
help you set up the whole program upside

226
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,820
program the devsecops program in itself

227
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,160
we have wonderful leaders who are

228
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,220
talking about threat modeling

229
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,279
what I can say is that that all these

230
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,640
things can actually help us in removing

231
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,760
the impact that we have

232
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,180
because supply chain risks are big

233
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,980
software is eating the whole world

234
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,140
and why do I say software is eating the

235
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,380
whole world because we are talking about

236
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,560
it we want the softwares to be here and

237
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,660
in order to understand

238
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,019
there's a software supply chain

239
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,140
came from let's discuss VR today and

240
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,480
where we were from software application

241
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,579
education

242
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,880
Mark Anderson penned his famous why

243
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,399
software is eating the world essay in

244
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,959
the Wall Street Journal in 2011.

245
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,060
12 years back

246
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,180
today the idea that every company needs

247
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,220
to become a software security company is

248
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,000
considered about almost like a cliche

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
now

250
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
think of the iPhone

251
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,839
which is like

252
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,360
a few years old

253
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,740
in 2011 Uber launched publicly in San

254
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,860
Francisco where I am today

255
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,019
which is so

256
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,019
get up begin testing food delivery into

257
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,560
the uh GrubHub game that began testing

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,100
food delivery in 2014.

259
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,640
10 years after it launched

260
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,240
now in 2015

261
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,940
there are so many things which started

262
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,519
changing now we are

263
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,459
in

264
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,000
2021-22 now what we really want to see

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,700
do we still want to see the code we are

266
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,620
testing the softwares

267
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,200
no we want it much more than that while

268
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
the innovation of new users new business

269
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,880
around application continues to

270
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,579
accelerate security within the modern

271
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,880
supply chain has

272
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
struggled to keep up

273
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,680
why when we are talking about all of

274
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,760
this

275
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,740
we're still struggling

276
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,680
and think of this this revolution which

277
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,779
is happening

278
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,339
earlier

279
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,459
we had one premise where we will be

280
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,579
building multiple people building of

281
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,980
servers infrastructures itops and

282
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,399
whatnot and now everything is in buried

283
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,940
in it that's what we call is that devops

284
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,940
devsecops and on top of it what is the

285
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,100
sub process of a supply chain

286
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,880
so it actually for example the ticket

287
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,480
this manufacturing supply chain

288
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,620
so what it says is that we take raw

289
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,000
materials

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,660
it goes to suppliers supplies actually

291
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,959
um have employees work on it goes to

292
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,540
manufacturing goes to wear a house from

293
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,120
Warehouse trucks pick up and then take

294
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,279
it to the consumer it looks so simple

295
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,579
that oh okay or even for that matter

296
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:36,779
food

297
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,579
farmer grows the food it goes to uh the

298
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,500
warehouse from warehouses goes to the

299
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
marketeers and then it goes to stores

300
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,920
stores people pick up and take home

301
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,980
again it's simple but then there are

302
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,959
many steps in that

303
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,700
it this process itself is a big process

304
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,560
and it needs

305
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,480
for proper security

306
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,300
even if a single thing is missed what

307
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,800
will happen

308
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,620
everything will fall apart so software

309
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,600
supply chain which is very similar into

310
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,180
the details of the manufacturing supply

311
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,639
chain because that's easy to understand

312
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,920
in the physical supply chain raw

313
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
materials people and process come

314
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,820
together to create the finished project

315
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,160
but each area and subject

316
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,680
to supply chain attack

317
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,980
I am a consumer even before something

318
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,700
reaches me something can happen

319
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,920
it's in the warehouse

320
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,300
uh people might run no people might uh

321
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,880
not get exactly what they want from the

322
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,320
warehouse

323
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,160
either it has become bad or there are

324
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,699
other issues now

325
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,800
documentation of course is vital

326
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,320
but what we need to do is we need to

327
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
have an automated process and now we

328
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,940
started to talk about the whole

329
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,740
um blockchain process

330
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,699
so that we have it stabilized but then

331
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,220
we're a long way to go

332
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
and the supply chain itself

333
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,420
there are set of materials tools that

334
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,519
from people

335
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,440
in the coding we have libraries and

336
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,459
containers

337
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,740
which again

338
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,959
we quote it with we actually have

339
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,139
ecosystem which sends it to the CI CD

340
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,959
pipeline then the code is stored

341
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,579
somewhere and the consumer starts using

342
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,880
it now think of a situation wherein

343
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,260
there is a binary which is vulnerable as

344
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,500
part of the core itself now the code is

345
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,959
ship to everyone

346
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,260
and everyone is using it

347
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,779
is it easy to be vulnerable

348
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,220
absolutely it is easy to understand

349
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,560
what things are happening

350
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,339
now let me tell you a situation

351
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,060
um did you hear about Solomon's attack

352
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,579
some of us have heard some of us have

353
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,279
not heard so if we go back and look at

354
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,100
this this particular attack what

355
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,720
happened there was a binary which was

356
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,519
added which was shipped now people

357
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,380
started using it and then organizations

358
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,079
realized something was not so right and

359
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,699
they started reporting

360
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,660
but it again boils down why the focus on

361
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,060
the software supply chain is

362
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,079
because of these attacks

363
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,180
exploiting the weakest links

364
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,320
which are trying to infiltrate the data

365
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,259
from the whole chain and there is one

366
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,899
point which is missed in the chain and

367
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,620
anyone can take leverage from it now

368
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,820
let's say my system gets hacked who

369
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,240
knows what data would be lost

370
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,639
how exactly they'll be tracked and now

371
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,040
the cases like solarwinds code core

372
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,799
Vision or Visual Studio code which was

373
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,260
uh where somebody got access to visual

374
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,640
studio code and they were able to get

375
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,939
access to a lot of GitHub accounts

376
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,599
but God's grace they reported it let uh

377
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,699
responsibly but things could have gone

378
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,439
in a wrong direction

379
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,500
as per research from Gartner which

380
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,339
predicts by 2025 45 of the organization

381
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,760
worldwide were experience these attacks

382
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
which is such a huge number

383
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,640
like threefold increase from what we

384
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,220
were yes uh yeah yesterday or probably

385
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,960
last year

386
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,340
now these software chain attacks

387
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,120
wherein Visual Studio code which is used

388
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,020
day in and day out as an IDE or not just

389
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,660
Visual Studio code but any IDE

390
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,240
if that has an issue

391
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,299
their independency confusions there are

392
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,640
container issues if you want to have

393
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,720
apis uh infrastructure wherein it is

394
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
helping us as early as possible but then

395
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,179
these issues keep coming in

396
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,380
keep creating a Havoc keep telling us

397
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,360
let's talk about it let's understand

398
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,120
what exists and what don't exist but

399
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,620
what is the problem

400
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,500
the problem is that we don't

401
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,940
differentiate between supply chain risks

402
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,760
and supply chain vulnerabilities supply

403
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,179
chain vulnerabilities wherein we can

404
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,940
actually if you get to know we can fix

405
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,059
them but for the risks we need to have a

406
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,100
proper threat modeling done

407
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,460
understand where things can go wrong in

408
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,740
our particular sector if we are part of

409
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,860
manufacturing Healthcare concentrating

410
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,919
on those minute details of it that

411
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,460
actually can help us in safeguarding

412
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,500
understanding those conflicts

413
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,419
impossible things

414
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,880
which people say but then

415
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,039
we can understand them

416
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,320
and there are times when we have things

417
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,480
in our environment and which we don't

418
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,120
know so yesterday there was a discussion

419
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,240
here with a few people around cyber

420
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,080
supply chain security Now the discussion

421
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,539
was everything is fine

422
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,600
but how about data classification

423
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,320
till the time we don't understand the

424
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,960
data classification we would be in

425
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,780
trouble till the time we do not maintain

426
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,100
these repositories we will always be in

427
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,380
weak we will always be a weakest link

428
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,500
how many of us do we maintain

429
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,440
s bombs software bill of materials

430
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,320
if you do not have one ovas has

431
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,340
wonderful project which is Cyclone DX I

432
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,320
would really urge everyone to at least

433
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,980
look at it it's a wonderful project

434
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,640
so much time has been invested in that

435
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,539
project

436
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,480
where people are trying to help out

437
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,059
organizations individuals so that they

438
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,860
can take help and then these supply

439
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,440
chain risks can be avoided it's a great

440
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,080
repository it's an amazing one and even

441
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,720
you can contribute to it

442
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,320
now while I say that these attacks keep

443
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,360
happening

444
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,240
from affecting the developer Ides

445
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,660
to affecting the cicd pipelines where

446
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,640
code call was infected

447
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,760
the simplest of thing which can create

448
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,000
issues and now the tool that we do use

449
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,660
day in and day out if they have bugs

450
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,960
it actually stays there or if we have a

451
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,940
container which is

452
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,220
vulnerable from the get-go

453
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,820
are we not impacted we are and that's

454
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,380
what happened with

455
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,559
um solo wins attack and then there's a

456
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,660
more scrutiny which is happening the

457
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,400
White House itself

458
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,340
actually release an advisory or a note

459
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,460
wherein

460
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,559
it specifically said let's start

461
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,020
concentrating on cyber security

462
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,140
and software security

463
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,039
now even though the leadership of the

464
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,120
countries

465
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,280
they are talking about let's have these

466
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,539
uh

467
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,620
things in embedded which can avoid risks

468
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,380
in the whole supply chain

469
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,080
or we would not be able to fix these

470
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,159
issues

471
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,580
we will keep seeing these inherent risks

472
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,020
which is leading to compromising of app

473
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,000
now all of this looks so fancy but then

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,880
if one thing in the pipeline gets

475
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,059
compromised here is a risk to it is a

476
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,700
risk to every portion

477
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,919
now let me give you an example

478
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,240
right now

479
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,880
how much of us uh how many of us know

480
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,539
that how much of a code is

481
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,919
um is maybe open source or connected to

482
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,500
a third party

483
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,940
very few of us

484
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,640
are we tracking each dependency

485
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,500
no we are not tracking each dependency

486
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,799
are we tracking anything and everything

487
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,679
which is downloaded from the internet no

488
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,860
we are a team of 10 developers one

489
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,380
person downloads a library leaves the

490
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,400
team

491
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,960
do we have the list of what he

492
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
downloaded or she downloaded or they

493
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
downloaded no we don't know that's why

494
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
documentation is very very important

495
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,419
that's what it can help us in

496
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:49,520
understanding the foundation

497
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,260
understanding how exactly supply chain

498
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,900
works and what we can do to make sure

499
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,460
that the supply chain attacks are

500
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,039
avoided

501
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,320
nist has released beautiful uh content

502
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,460
about it

503
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,860
and so many other Frameworks which are

504
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,440
there these Frameworks are actually

505
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,720
helping us

506
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,080
weakness VCS is controlled and where we

507
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,480
are talking about ovasp

508
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,980
and on top of it it again helps us in

509
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,840
coming to a point where we have software

510
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,220
bill of material

511
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,760
now I would request you to look at the

512
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,380
different things which are there and

513
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,260
specially Cyclone DX

514
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,059
which is helping us

515
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:37,700
and let's talk about secure code

516
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,780
understanding our own dependencies

517
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,700
containers

518
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,120
s-bombs infrastructure as a code the

519
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,340
custom code that we are trying to run

520
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,260
now

521
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,659
it also brings us to the point

522
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,380
that how much risk aware we are because

523
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,080
of our dependencies and solarwinds is

524
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,260
not just the one the recent example if I

525
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,940
talk about in this whole pipeline

526
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,039
third-party tools secret management and

527
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,760
whatnot block project is a big thing

528
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,460
but especially in December I was on

529
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,840
vacation and suddenly this thing

530
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,919
happened

531
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,280
everyone was talking about it why

532
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,640
didn't we monitor it were we not aware

533
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,100
about whether we are using it or not

534
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,380
and especially this is a logging

535
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,419
platform which most of the organizations

536
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,980
were using

537
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,020
everyone went crazy

538
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,960
but the devsecop thing when we are

539
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,679
trying to integrate it it was integrated

540
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,380
poor inside of an app

541
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,380
still these issues happen issues happen

542
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,840
now are we going to have less or more

543
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,360
software in the future

544
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,220
are we going to have less or more open

545
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,799
source software in the future

546
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,559
we will have more and we will keep

547
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,740
seeing these issues

548
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,419
is a very well known Apache logging

549
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,080
framework which impacted

550
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,919
million dollar

551
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,659
organizations

552
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,600
to the smallest of organizations

553
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,380
but it costed huge amount of money

554
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,559
which specifically comes out saying that

555
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,440
when these things are very prevalent it

556
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,780
it's important to understand

557
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,080
that how exactly Regulatory Compliance

558
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,720
works if something fails

559
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,120
how exactly Cloud security controls are

560
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,820
there and why am I talking about Cloud

561
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,580
security control because we have one

562
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,559
foot in open source another foot in

563
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,520
Cloud

564
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,919
there are third-party applications that

565
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,360
I'm using

566
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,159
which is leading to remote code

567
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,220
executions to server control failures to

568
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,440
what not

569
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
especially controlling these third-party

570
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,299
risks is a big thing

571
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:57,360
because if we don't actually completely

572
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,740
look into it

573
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,299
then what will happen

574
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,840
somebody might be able to deploy malware

575
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,159
ransomers they would be able to take

576
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,980
over our application which will lead to

577
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,400
actually trust issues

578
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,440
and not just that

579
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,080
when these popular platforms keep coming

580
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,900
up with zero day issues it brings us to

581
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,080
the point that let's go ahead and have

582
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,360
an environment wherein even if when

583
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,919
we're sleeping

584
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,600
we can actually

585
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,880
understand okay this is where the

586
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,340
problem is let me fix it

587
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,820
it will not happen overnight for that we

588
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,419
need to have Community like ovasp

589
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:42,240
which actually always make aware people

590
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,000
around software supply chain issues

591
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,179
around software security around

592
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,279
devsecops

593
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,279
there are wonderful people in a vast

594
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,159
Community you can actually take help

595
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,240
from

596
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,880
there are projects which are there to

597
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,299
help you out and if you have any issues

598
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,520
with any of the project understanding

599
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,279
you can reach out to the leaders

600
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,520
they're really helpful every one of the

601
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,559
leader is actually contributing their

602
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,140
valuable time to the project

603
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,779
so there's something that you feel needs

604
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,299
to be changed modified please do make a

605
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,179
pull request to the leaders so that they

606
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,860
can actually update it

607
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,960
everyone is contributing their valuable

608
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,600
time and the mission is to make sure

609
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,880
let's make application security visible

610
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,059
to the people and helpful

611
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,640
it also brings me to the point wherein I

612
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,679
want to share that I started a series on

613
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,960
my YouTube channel around ovasp

614
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,659
Spotlight series which has around 25

615
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,799
projects and this year from July you'll

616
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,539
see more and more projects coming up

617
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,580
where we are trying to cover each

618
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,419
project in 15 minutes

619
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,100
so for dependency vulnerabilities to

620
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,960
application vulnerabilities

621
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,600
attackers are trying to Target the big

622
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,860
ecosystem

623
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,840
application security is becoming more

624
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,260
and more challenging by each passing day

625
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,000
but what we can do is we can understand

626
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,159
the cloud security and open source

627
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,620
security as a mix

628
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,419
by understanding

629
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,720
if we make the security easier developer

630
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,940
friendly and actionable

631
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,940
things can be much more easier things

632
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,000
can be much more helpful

633
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,179
and we can detect these issues as early

634
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,100
as possible

635
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,039
while we talk about these standards we

636
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,440
talk about the security issues we talk

637
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,380
about how do we address them it brings

638
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,640
us to the point

639
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,580
let's have best practices for open

640
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,799
source security which ovasp is trying to

641
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,820
share

642
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,940
and open source is amazing but let's use

643
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,039
it responsibly

644
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,159
let's have security Champions who

645
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,860
actually can Advocate about it like we

646
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,320
are doing today but who is a security

647
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,419
champion

648
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,659
now security Champion is a one

649
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,640
was actually helping different teams

650
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,039
other organization

651
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,500
in driving security

652
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,600
it can be a project manager it can be a

653
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,020
developer it can be a tester it may not

654
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,600
be just a security person or the person

655
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,360
from a security team

656
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,220
we also

657
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,320
it can also help in having a focal point

658
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,659
understanding how exactly we can program

659
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,260
further I am sure a lot of us in the

660
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,919
call today or in the session today are

661
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,559
developers testers or even who wants to

662
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,260
grow up in the cyber security space who

663
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,659
wants to move up the ladder who wants to

664
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,159
take a step further in application

665
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,240
security

666
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,240
that when we have so many people from

667
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,159
different areas

668
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,360
anyone can be a security champion

669
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,860
which can influence the cycle of cicd

670
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,980
and we can have a software which is

671
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,320
built securely

672
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,580
now it also brings me to the point that

673
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,220
when we have everything

674
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,980
which we understand it's just that we

675
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,380
need to stick together those pieces of

676
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,899
puzzle and we need to start working

677
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,899
towards safe environment supply chain

678
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,480
attacks are not new they have been there

679
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
for ages

680
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,580
and they might be there then we grow up

681
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,220
or when our kids are going to grow up if

682
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,899
we don't start looking at the small

683
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,659
things which matter the most

684
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,380
wherein we can stitch the security in

685
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,559
where we can bake the security in

686
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,480
where we start trying to talk about

687
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,299
shift left or left shift

688
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,120
or starting the security early talking

689
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,200
about security by default

690
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,539
this is the small presentation that I

691
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,159
wanted to share around supply chain

692
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,240
security

693
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,340
there are few things

694
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,760
that we all can do to make sure

695
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,520
that supply chain risks are avoided

696
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,559
thank you so much for listening to me

697
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,260
today if there are any questions please

698
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,620
to post your questions in boha platform

699
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,419
or you can actually

700
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,820
um share it here I would love to speak

701
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,178
to you

702
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,679
thank you very much for your very nice

703
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,120
presentation

704
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,279
actually the internet connection was

705
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,640
very good so we didn't have any problem

706
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,200
thank you so much

707
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,880
uh let me move to the Q a session

708
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,559
and we will pick questions from our

709
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,779
session participants

710
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,340
so

711
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,340
the question is like we are moving to uh

712
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,860
digitize

713
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,980
Society we are trying to digitize our

714
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,320
society each and everything around that

715
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,460
so

716
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,899
how these softwares supply chain attack

717
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:26,779
could create problems to to future of

718
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,799
digitization what do you think

719
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,100
while we talk about digitization it

720
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,100
simply means that we have some software

721
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,279
or could be on-premise service we're

722
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,980
taking it to the internet now when that

723
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,200
is happening

724
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,659
it's imperative that we understand that

725
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,880
we are already preached

726
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,580
it brings us to the point telling us

727
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,580
that let's track what we have let's

728
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,659
start there

729
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,059
a lot of times we don't even know what

730
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,940
we have in our house for example there

731
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,480
are four doors four windows and there's

732
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,580
a small

733
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,820
space that we've built for our pets to

734
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,419
come in now we go on a vacation we close

735
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,519
the door we close this place for the pet

736
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,080
because that's coming along with us

737
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,240
we've closed some of the windows but

738
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,580
this one window which is open

739
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,039
which we didn't realize that it's not

740
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,620
closed properly

741
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,539
an attacker comes in

742
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,080
and steals the data or steals the

743
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,519
valuable things

744
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,179
so how are we going to tackle that

745
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,700
so it simply means let's start

746
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,880
understanding our own data first let's

747
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,000
classify it let's understand what tools

748
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,100
we have let's understand what

749
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,039
dependencies we have third party vendors

750
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,779
we interact with

751
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,059
even in the recent cases

752
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,279
there were organizations which were not

753
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,340
vulnerable

754
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,000
but

755
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,700
there were internally third-party

756
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,460
vendors which were part of the code

757
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,918
actually they were one or another so

758
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,379
does it say that I am not vulnerable no

759
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,839
but I am connected to them

760
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,179
so I was vulnerable

761
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,139
what it also implicitly says that that

762
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,239
anything that we do in our environment

763
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,599
let's keep a track of it

764
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,379
let's no get to know that okay

765
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,119
these are the dependencies would be

766
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,520
there this these are the connections

767
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,379
that we have these are the software

768
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,179
tools that we have these are the third

769
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,859
party tools that we have these are the

770
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,719
connections or endpoints that we have

771
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,080
this is the API that we are using

772
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,719
which we are leveraging from maybe a

773
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,980
third party

774
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,500
so understanding that thing probably

775
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,540
helps in digitization

776
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,879
and understanding that okay these things

777
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,339
are helpful and on top of it

778
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,980
as I said if you're setting the whole

779
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,660
supply chain ecosystem and you want

780
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,800
s-bombs Cyclone DS is Amazing Project

781
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,339
which can help you out even not just

782
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,440
that there are many other posture

783
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,960
management tools that we have or

784
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,599
um the whole

785
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,339
devsecops ecosystem setup tools that we

786
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,560
have that can help you in setting it up

787
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,079
setting up your ecosystem or environment

788
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,660
or understanding that the whole

789
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,300
digitization change that I see that we

790
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,780
are seeing

791
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,260
um thank you very much uh in the second

792
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,180
question probably the last one

793
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,920
the question is like the the way like

794
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,859
Academia or academic Society the way

795
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,500
Industries and the ways government

796
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,680
look into the problem is different like

797
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,359
when it comes to cyber security or

798
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,440
whatever

799
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,180
so what do you think like what are the

800
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,440
rules of

801
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,420
academic institution government

802
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,180
institution and Industry in order to

803
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,339
tackle this problem or in order to

804
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,500
somehow answer this problem

805
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,579
properly by problem we mean the supply

806
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,619
chain attack

807
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,980
right so what I've seen is that now that

808
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,079
education is getting bigger and better

809
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,780
in this area

810
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,040
especially the discussions that I'm

811
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,320
seeing around these days

812
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,240
um

813
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,020
government

814
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,300
educational institutions

815
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,200
to the organizations to a person who's

816
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,780
just a software developer they've

817
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,420
started to talk about these issues and

818
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,060
let's start there that now we're talking

819
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,579
about it there are times when we never

820
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,280
spoke about these issues and they keep

821
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,160
kept creeping in so especially

822
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,960
government is actually trying to

823
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,720
emphasize that let's try and fix these

824
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
issues

825
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
so that we can have safe environment

826
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,220
for every one of us educational

827
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,200
educational institutions who are

828
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,839
trying to give the theoretical knowledge

829
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,599
to the people who are actually ground up

830
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,560
but now they want the industry experts

831
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,040
to come in and share their knowledge so

832
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,680
that the people or the students who come

833
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,680
out of the college they know bits and

834
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,480
pieces of it which they can stitch

835
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,960
together and start using it

836
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,420
during the pandemic educational

837
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,640
institutions to everyone hit so badly

838
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,680
kids were getting homeschooled they're

839
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,599
still places where kids are getting

840
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,420
homeschooled colleges everyone was

841
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,579
studying online even today if we're

842
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,800
talking about ovas conference it was

843
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,420
supposed to happen in Dublin but we are

844
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,400
virgin

845
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,320
understanding the scenarios so these

846
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,119
things can happen now it brings us to

847
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,940
the point how sustainable we can be

848
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,020
how exactly we can meet again virtually

849
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,680
so it also emphasizes that understanding

850
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,079
of the topic itself is first important

851
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,480
between which every organization is

852
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,780
trying to do addressing is the second

853
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,420
first understanding a lot of times we

854
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,400
don't understand what is the problem and

855
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,260
we say oh we need to handle it because

856
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,079
others are facing

857
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,599
so that's important to do so probably my

858
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,300
take is that we are talking about it we

859
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,940
are trying to move towards it so that's

860
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,400
actually will take us

861
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,339
slowly towards solving the problem

862
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,180
that's more important

863
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,760
uh thank you very much

864
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,520
I think it's very interesting idea to

865
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,260
talk and I have even personally I have

866
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,880
so many questions to talk and discuss

867
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,940
and probably in our next opportunities

868
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,859
uh so we are running out of time thank

869
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,579
