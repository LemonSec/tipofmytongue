1
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,440
okay so uh and thank you so much for uh

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,780
to join this session and uh having

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,900
showing interest in this Tool uh my tool

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,839
name is Nightingale uh which is uh if it

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
if if I uh conclude it's uh the nature

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,060
of this tool it's a Docker image and

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,359
Docker image for pen tester so let's get

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,380
started

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,599
so before jumping to the actual uh

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,300
presentation actual uh demonstration of

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,460
the Tool uh what exactly tool is doing

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,160
and uh what are the tools and what are

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,960
the configurations and what are the

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,059
programming language uh this tool has

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,040
been supported so before jumping into

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,899
that so let me tell you the problem

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,480
statement so why and with that problem

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,000
statement uh I will I will clear each

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,100
and everything like why I created this

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,539
application or two so uh I am uh doing

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,480
bug Bounty like uh three or three point

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,420
five years back so I have to create a

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,800
separate environment in the virtual

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,739
machine and uh so create a separate uh

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,299
environment in the virtual machine we

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,180
need to install uh multiple programming

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,700
languages support like due to the nature

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,659
of the

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,760
um various tools or various uh open

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,740
source tools we can say which we use in

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,159
our County uh uh process for any of the

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,500
targets whether it can be whether it can

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,720
be mobile or network or anything

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
so I have to take a one day from like

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,020
from morning I I will start like uh

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,960
configuration of the tool and uh

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,520
installing all the programming languages

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
and you know uh set up the configuration

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,259
files for specific tools like they

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,420
require some uh some configuration some

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,220
external configuration and other part of

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,159
custom so I'll I have created that uh

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,619
environment and next day or uh after

44
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,079
some day like uh again when I start my

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,600
virtual machine it got crashed now the

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,119
problem is when once your virtual

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
machine got cached it's pretty uh tough

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
for me for me as well like I faced this

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,979
to not able to recover that particular

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,680
instance and my complete data my

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,179
complete tool installation and my

52
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,760
complete configuration uh including the

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,140
programming languages installation

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,660
completely got first and I have to

55
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,360
create I have to make I have to follow

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,239
all the steps again and again after you

57
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,940
know after some some period of time so

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,040
with that one only Nightingale came into

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,800
an existence and I thought this this

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,620
solution will be a better solution

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,379
uh in terms of you know uh start doing

62
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,480
pen testing or start doing any of the

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,720
any uh testing in any of these scope

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,060
so before jumping to actual uh

65
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,879
presentation actual uh introduction of

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,319
this tool so let me tell you about

67
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,459
myself so I am uh Raja nagori and I work

68
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,879
as is consultant second at FIS Global uh

69
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,739
there is an organization in India which

70
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,620
is named as Isaac and from that

71
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,099
organization I uh I got this title that

72
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,200
cybercam intervention officer where he

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,599
usually take some cyber crime cases and

74
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,239
you know interact the local police

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,180
stations to help them to provide some

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,940
useful insights with them and to discuss

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,000
about the same about any of the cases I

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
am also a senate member uh I am

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
contributing to or Community by

80
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,980
providing the best uh the knowledge with

81
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,459
the best of my knowledge and uh I create

82
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,980
uh videos on YouTube So currently I have

83
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,959
created a playlist for mobile pen

84
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,200
testing in Android specifically and I

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
write blogs uh on on various technical

86
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,080
specifications regarding uh Mobile Print

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,239
testing regarding any profoundly sort of

88
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,879
uh procedure that we have to follow for

89
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,799
a certain or a for a specific

90
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,239
vulnerability

91
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,580
apart from my all technical things I

92
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,799
play guitar for the index music so this

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,860
is my five time uh what we can say

94
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,299
um my part-time uh entertainment sort of

95
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,540
thing so I do this for uh for My Fun

96
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,620
only

97
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,920
so coming to the uh the introduction of

98
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,680
the Nightingale so about the Nightingale

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,799
so Nightingale is nothing but a

100
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,500
completely based on the topic technology

101
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,418
and this Docker technology I have

102
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,680
created a Docker file for uh like

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,540
providing all the configuration and all

104
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,699
the other stuff we will see in in the

105
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,520
later slide like uh uh how I create the

106
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,740
architecture of this particular tool and

107
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,620
how you able to uh connect or how you

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,080
able to run the container for the same

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,560
okay so let's talk about some uh some

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,220
features of this tool so uh Nightingale

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,380
is a platform independent so what

112
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,320
exactly does it mean like uh if any of

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,060
the operating systems support Docker

114
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,460
Nightingale can be it can be able to run

115
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,740
on that particular uh operating system

116
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,900
so whether it can be Mac OS whether it

117
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,360
can be Linux uh Ubuntu mint whatever

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,940
suits you and uh whether it can be

119
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,820
Windows 11 or 10. so I think Docker is

120
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,759
is something like it is uh it is

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,560
like it is

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,680
um it can be run in in uh each of the

123
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,060
operating system

124
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,620
so Nightingale has the multiple

125
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,479
programming language so now this point

126
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,759
is something like uh you can relate uh

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,340
you when you have to install uh python

128
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,320
when you have to install go language

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,539
when you have to install node uh with

130
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,479
the use of NVM when you have to use uh I

131
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,120
mean install Java so you have to run

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,580
some some commands uh according to the

133
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,100
operating system so if we talk about uh

134
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,720
windows then you have to download the

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,419
exe files if you if you talk about uh

136
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,340
the next then you have to download the

137
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,860
Debian file or uh like by installing the

138
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,620
utilities and in Mac OS there is again a

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,660
brew which are being used for installing

140
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,419
these utilities but in Nightingale you

141
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,160
don't need to install anything once you

142
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,780
up the container once you start the

143
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,520
container all your programming languages

144
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,620
will be installed and will be there for

145
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,039
uh for for the use of further uh further

146
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,160
uh like task or the further operation

147
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,780
you will be going to perform

148
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,940
now the third point is booting is very

149
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,400
fast now Boot uh so booting is something

150
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,280
like we can relate when we start our

151
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,740
machine we start our host machine or the

152
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,780
main machine we can say and it will take

153
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,819
time to you know load all the background

154
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,340
processes all the uh functionalities all

155
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,860
the services which is necessary for you

156
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,380
know uh start the whole service or the

157
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,960
machine now booty is very fast now

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,240
exactly does it mean is like this

159
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,580
container uh this Nightingale will will

160
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,080
take not more than when you uh like like

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,240
you just blink off an eye and it will it

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,940
will start and it will uh like ready to

163
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,400
use uh like a setup tool so you don't

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,039
need to wait for uh one to two minutes

165
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,199
to just boot up boot up that particular

166
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,259
process and uh start working on that

167
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,960
our second Point uh next point is uh all

168
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
tools installed already now what exactly

169
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,919
does it mean like

170
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,440
um all the tools which may be required

171
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
or which is required at the time of pen

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
testing as per your requirement so let's

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,340
say if you are working uh for testing a

174
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,240
network I mean uh a bunch of ips right

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,780
now you required Amy for the same so you

176
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,419
can use that particular tool and that

177
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,919
tool is already installed in your

178
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,199
Nightingale so you don't need to run apt

179
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,479
get install and map so it will install

180
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,520
that particular thing and then you will

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,039
start working on that so it that

182
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,740
complete process has been uh done at the

183
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,479
time of image building at the time of

184
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,599
Docker imageable thing so so now if you

185
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,940
want to use uh let's say nmap then you

186
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,280
just need to type nmap and you will be

187
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,240
you will be work like a pro now it is

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
very easy to set up so you don't need to

189
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,060
configure anything uh during the setup

190
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,280
of this uh Nightingale so what you have

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,440
to do is like install the docker engine

192
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,139
in your respective operating system and

193
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,940
you don't need to worry about anything

194
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,160
regarding the setup of the same

195
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,680
and the very last point and not last

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,660
it's actually the second last point is

197
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,680
uh it is for the CLI lovers now uh those

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,039
who want who's working uh like who lies

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,319
working in the command line tools or uh

200
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,180
working with those uh tools which

201
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,699
provide you data over the terminal in a

202
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,219
specific format so that that tool is for

203
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,399
uh those but if anyone wants to if

204
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,919
anyone don't uh don't love that CLI part

205
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,659
they can also love this tool because

206
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,360
this is completely and this is very fast

207
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,880
and it you will you will uh getting all

208
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
the tools pre-installed you don't need

209
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,320
to do anything now the main part is uh

210
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,580
Nightingale will pull down your

211
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,860
frustration level I mean uh that

212
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,560
frustration level is like uh I told you

213
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,779
in the problem statement uh like that's

214
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,820
frustration when you're configured

215
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,680
virtual machine Port crashed every time

216
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,980
and in Nightingale so somehow somewhere

217
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,959
your container got crashed and your data

218
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,300
will be your data will not crash your

219
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,940
configuration will not uh HDR

220
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,279
installation tools will not pressed or

221
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,000
will not Purge anyway so once you once

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
you again uh again start your container

223
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
all your configuration all your

224
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,300
installation tools programming language

225
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,100
support data everything will be there

226
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,320
you don't need to worry about like your

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,600
data will be lost it or anything else

228
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
like that that happen usually happen in

229
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Virtual Notions

230
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,420
okay so before jumping to uh again the

231
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,640
demonstration let me uh tell you the

232
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,920
concept of uh like a little concept

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
about Docker what exactly Docker is and

234
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,779
why I choose this Docker so if we talk

235
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,180
about virtual so before jumping to the

236
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,240
actual con uh difference for this uh let

237
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,980
me tell you one thing I am not I'm not

238
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,339
telling like the uh virtual machine is

239
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,680
not good at in this particular

240
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,959
Nightingale it is good but there are

241
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,660
some pros and cons so what I believe is

242
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,180
like so that's why I choose the docker

243
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,100
Technologies to create this Nightingale

244
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,399
okay so now uh coming to the difference

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,860
um okay so in virtual machine there is a

246
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,140
there is a concept called hypervisor and

247
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,080
above of that there are multiple guest

248
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
operating system and those guest

249
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,740
operating system has their own binaries

250
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,140
and libraries and other services which

251
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,480
usually we see in our host machine on

252
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,820
Main machine and on the top of that we

253
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,800
are running a separate application so

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,220
that we can uh like bifurcate all the

255
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,600
application according to the guest

256
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
operating system

257
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
now if we talk about a Docker operator

258
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,839
uh I mean containerization system so

259
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,579
there is operating system which again

260
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,100
our main machine and there is a

261
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,779
container engine which is nothing but a

262
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,459
Docker engine or the docker software

263
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,260
which are respective of their operating

264
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,600
system and at the top of that there are

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,420
images which contains binaries libraries

266
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,399
and other services which required

267
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,680
normally required at the uh for any of

268
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,040
the operating systems so um and on the

269
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,220
top of that each of the docker image or

270
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,920
image we can say has their application

271
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,200
and they are like you can you can

272
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,339
communicate with each of the application

273
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,620
and you if you don't want to communicate

274
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,079
any of the application and you want to

275
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,940
run separately then you can do that also

276
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,560
there are some configurations in the

277
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,019
docker at the time of uh creating the

278
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,399
docker container so there are some

279
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,140
configuration and with that

280
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,260
configuration you can able to uh like

281
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,200
disconnect a specific application to the

282
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,600
network so this is the main concept this

283
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,880
is the very basic concept and uh this is

284
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,899
very uh uh highlighted concept for which

285
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,600
like I choose that uh Docker Docker

286
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,040
Technologies for creating this

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,540
Nightingale

288
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,839
okay so I have created one uh file that

289
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,420
is practice Mantra and uh which says

290
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,760
like I believe in Hands-On practice so

291
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
let's jump to the Practical

292
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,540
implementation uh how we can go with

293
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,079
that uh that demonstration and the

294
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,060
source code of the two

295
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,079
just a second

296
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,500
for all of us especially developers and

297
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
I see that the image that you're trying

298
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,660
to uh that you have developed of course

299
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,360
for us would be very useful especially

300
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,880
for everyone who likes to use command

301
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,579
line interface especially I see that

302
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,959
you're ready to continue with our

303
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,660
presentation so I will give the word to

304
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,040
you thank you thank you okay so uh so

305
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
let's let's go to the architecture of

306
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,260
this application and for the

307
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,579
architecture of this application it is

308
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,459
very simple very uh readable in format

309
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,860
like you don't need to uh like you will

310
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,360
not be able to confuse in that

311
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,579
particular thing like how we can go with

312
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,339
uh the step-by-step procedure for the

313
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,000
same so uh for every category I have

314
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,880
defined these uh categorization for it

315
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,639
like every scope whether it can be uh

316
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,040
word list I can also consider as a stop

317
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
because we are using these as a fuzzing

318
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,959
or you know uh like a directory

319
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,360
nomination another part of the brute

320
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,000
forcing another part of the methods that

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,420
we usually perform in in our methods in

322
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,480
our tasks or in our daily job so the so

323
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,579
all these files I mean in the docker

324
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,680
Docker folder files all the

325
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,019
categorization of the files has been uh

326
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,420
available and if we talk about let's say

327
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,260
web uh vapt so but before jumping to

328
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,839
that uh let me tell you uh let me show

329
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,120
you that uh programming languages so

330
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,459
that programming languages we usually

331
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,639
start with uh pulling the Debian file

332
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
which is again a base file we can say

333
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,019
and followed by all the library

334
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,040
installation that is required for uh any

335
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
of the Linux environment which we

336
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,600
usually do once we uh once we install

337
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
Ubuntu system or Mint or any any other

338
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
Linux flavor for this thing we usually

339
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,720
do update and upgrade to uh to update

340
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,180
all the libraries that has the upgrade

341
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,220
for this specific version or specific

342
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,639
library and followed by installation of

343
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,240
the Python 3 module followed by uh Java

344
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,779
module I mean Java programming languages

345
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,360
followed by go language followed by uh

346
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,820
node.js and once all the configuration

347
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,579
setting has been done uh I'll have just

348
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,740
clear all the unnecessary things from

349
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,560
the uh from the images to make the less

350
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,500
size of this particular image now that

351
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,779
is very important that programming

352
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,880
language file is very important so that

353
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,220
will depend on the other categories or

354
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,920
other files of PC so if we talk about uh

355
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,620
web so I have just taken this particular

356
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,360
programming language because I have

357
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,420
already create created that images so I

358
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,240
will not take any of the another data uh

359
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,699
like another new data for this link so

360
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,740
I'll take the data from this particular

361
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,560
image and I move further for installing

362
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
all the tools which is required at the

363
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,079
time of web penetration testing so like

364
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,940
the architecture goes like

365
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,160
I have created again a build essential

366
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,860
that is again required because that will

367
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,380
only provide you the data which is uh

368
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,959
which is available on the uh home

369
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,519
directories or any of the directory

370
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,040
which has the uh I mean static data or

371
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680
static files but it will not provide

372
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,199
anything like uh module installation

373
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,019
Library installation so everything will

374
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,060
take care with this particular image and

375
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,740
the rest of the thing will take care by

376
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,120
uh by the image by the uh uh by the

377
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,060
update and upgrade command so now we

378
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,839
have the support of python and uh uh go

379
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,260
node.js and Java languages so next I

380
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,660
have created the directories and that

381
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,300
directory is nothing but like I just

382
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,880
uploading all the required tools in the

383
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,459
specific uh folder so that we will not

384
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,260
confuse in any way

385
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,399
and uh I have created the uh environment

386
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,199
variable for the scene and with that

387
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,720
environment variable we can uh call this

388
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,420
particular directory wherever we want in

389
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,940
this particular uh code so that is again

390
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,240
a very uh uh a plus point for this like

391
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,519
if I want to call this particular graph

392
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,860
pattern somewhere else in the code so I

393
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,800
can just put this uh dollar and followed

394
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,540
by curly braces and provide the

395
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,639
environment variable for the same which

396
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,920
is uh which is very normal in Linux

397
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,500
machines which we we all usually doing

398
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,980
the same in our day-to-day life so uh

399
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,740
coming coming uh down to this particular

400
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
thing so so like I just take this

401
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,420
particular directory and just cloning

402
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,000
all the tools which is required for you

403
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,639
like for required uh at the time of

404
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,899
testing

405
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,480
then I uh so after creating after

406
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,540
cloning the uh I mean repository it

407
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,179
automatically create the folder so I

408
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,579
just go to that folder uh run the python

409
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,799
commands and it will come automatically

410
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,500
set up all the things all the uh I mean

411
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,959
required things for the same

412
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,140
so that is that is particularly uh done

413
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,720
for the web application web vapt thing

414
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,079
so once if you install a setup file or

415
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,900
any module installation so it will goes

416
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,000
into the library system which which is

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,640
not copied uh from one always to another

418
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,880
OS so what specifically this file I have

419
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,400
to create I have to run this uh these

420
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,280
installation module file so if I if I

421
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,380
change the docker file we have to again

422
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,260
uh install these these module because of

423
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,559
the nature of the the modules of python

424
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,740
so uh like we have the programming

425
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,480
language support but we have to install

426
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,600
all the modules for the same and next uh

427
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,539
again I just uh install emrs and other

428
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,539
other uh part of the application and

429
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,880
again uh I did like I remove all The

430
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,220
Unwanted things for the Sim and it is

431
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,320
the concept is same for all the files

432
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,299
which is uh mentioned here like if we

433
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,280
talk about uh osync

434
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,500
we have already the uh the programming

435
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,059
language support what we are doing is

436
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,640
like we are just um

437
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,919
uh like installing all the requirement

438
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,039
things sort of uh for the for these of

439
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,120
the tools

440
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,059
and uh coming to the main file now main

441
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,020
file has something like uh it is already

442
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,320
um mentioned it is already taking the uh

443
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,900
the the the data from the other images

444
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,059
other file images now these are the

445
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,940
other file images now uh it is copying

446
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,059
the content of the image from this

447
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,919
particular directory to this directory

448
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,780
now this particular directory is nothing

449
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,900
but I have mentioned this here now this

450
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,240
is this complete configuration work is a

451
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
separate image and these images are work

452
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
as a separate image now if I want to

453
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,620
copy data from one image to another

454
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,720
image then this particular configuration

455
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,240
will work here so now uh this is the

456
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,780
this is the uh working of uh what we can

457
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,240
say the working of this I mean the

458
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,360
architecture of this tool let's jump to

459
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,679
the um

460
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,280
the demonstration part of uh Nightingale

461
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,360
okay so uh this is my repository you can

462
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,900
just uh type user colon Raja nagori so

463
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,720
you will be getting uh this particular

464
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,200
uh repository in your machine and I have

465
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
mentioned each and every detail uh the

466
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
very bare minimum and where basic uh

467
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,419
detail in this particular uh readme

468
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,880
section where you will be able to get uh

469
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,100
like amount of pros and cons and

470
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
whatever I just told you in the very

471
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,580
first in the very beginning of this

472
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,419
presentation so here if we if we go with

473
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,140
the okay if I if you if anyone wants to

474
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,660
uh check the architecture diagram like

475
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,539
to better understanding the better way

476
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,760
to understand this thing so you can

477
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,500
download that also

478
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,419
but it seems like

479
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,020
um

480
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,860
yes so if you want to see uh the

481
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,799
architecture so they these all are the

482
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,320
separate Docker files all the content

483
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,539
are copying to the main file all the

484
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,100
configurations are set of place in that

485
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,380
directory and other other modulation

486
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,080
installation binaries and and then it

487
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,140
will create a main image for night image

488
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,500
so coming back to the list of the

489
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,020
commands that you have to run so there

490
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,720
are two ways to create this image either

491
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,240
you if you can just pull this particular

492
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,039
emails the pre-built image from the

493
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,100
topper up and if you want to alter some

494
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,260
some configuration here and if you want

495
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,840
to create your own Docker uh Docker

496
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,059
image then you can just follow the these

497
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,539
uh these these commands and uh so I'm

498
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,539
just skipping all uh the the creating

499
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,640
images and creating the container for

500
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,740
the same I'm just going to the direct

501
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,440
command which is required to start the

502
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,580
container so I have already started the

503
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,380
country but for the demonstration

504
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,559
purpose I just changed the photo okay so

505
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,960
let me uh

506
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,659
six little zero and uh

507
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,080
six zero zero

508
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,240
seven okay so I have just changed the

509
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,360
port number so just checked it uh it

510
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,140
will create us uh like us

511
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,380
a unique number for the container and it

512
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,500
just started so it will not take that

513
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,140
much time to uh start the container if

514
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,720
in if we can see here we have uh running

515
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,360
this particular container six zero zero

516
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,700
six as I have already created a new

517
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,799
container so let's jump into the two

518
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,140
okay so this Tool uh is again as I have

519
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,720
already mentioned in uh in my previous

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,260
slides so it is a c like complete PCL I

521
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,120
think so

522
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,080
um

523
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
okay

524
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,860
I think I have

525
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,120
so here you can see

526
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,159
um

527
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,500
like as what I have told these are the

528
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,020
categorization of the uh scope of this

529
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,000
tool like if you want to work with the

530
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
vapt tools then there is a folder if you

531
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,460
want to work as a whole sign then there

532
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,980
is a folder so same goes like uh after

533
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,480
creating the docker image or after

534
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,840
pulling the document so if we want to

535
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,340
let's say

536
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,280
um okay if you want to go with the vapt

537
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,039
so there are n number of tools not n

538
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
number of like there are specific number

539
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
but we can install n number of to what

540
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,039
uh number of which you want to install

541
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,559
in your machine so that's not an issue

542
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,140
so it will take it will not uh it will

543
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,460
not make any any impact make any uh uh

544
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,919
load on this particular content

545
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,419
so let's say if I want to use uh that

546
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:22,980
search

547
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,500
so there is um

548
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,900
okay so if I go with let's say Python 3

549
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,080
dot search

550
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,799
so as you can see here I am able to run

551
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,860
this particular tool which is again used

552
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,400
for finding the uh the directories the

553
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,440
directory numeration for any of the URLs

554
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,200
so this is how it is it will work now

555
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
there are some multiple features uh

556
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,539
which I haven't showed in the first

557
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,640
slide in the very first beginning of

558
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,340
this slide because I want to show that

559
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,020
practically now the thing is uh so you

560
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,880
can relate this particular feature this

561
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,340
particular thing uh like if you are

562
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,840
working in a Linux environment or

563
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,580
Windows environment or Mac environment

564
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,980
you are just putting multiple tabs

565
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,340
multiple uh terminals like you set up

566
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,980
these terminals in the screen just to

567
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,740
set up just to take all the data

568
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,780
um uh relatable to you know what data

569
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,299
you are getting from one terminal and

570
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,799
what other data you are getting from it

571
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,840
another terminal so just go through with

572
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,140
all the things so uh in our browsers

573
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,600
there there is a there is a feature or

574
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,520
there is a functionality we can say you

575
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,020
can open up to 99 tabs at a time so so

576
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,080
in that 99 tabs you can just open the

577
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,360
another another instance of this

578
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,460
particular Nightingale thing so let me

579
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,659
open that

580
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:52,500
um

581
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,419
six zero zero

582
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,400
six

583
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,860
Okay cool so now as you can see I have

584
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,500
like just to show you just to

585
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,360
demonstrate you the thing I have just

586
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,340
run this particular command and it shows

587
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,500
all the menus all the parameters for

588
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,600
this particular tool and when I hit that

589
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,640
another tool another new terminal

590
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,059
another new tab so the complete data is

591
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,880
a new session for the previous one so

592
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,400
the thing is it is completely

593
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,620
independent what you are doing in the

594
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,659
previous step and what you want you will

595
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,179
be going to do in your uh in your very

596
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,419
new and very new uh new session or the

597
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,059
new terminal of this Nightingale so let

598
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:38,059
me uh done a very simple command

599
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,460
because we're on a live demo do not

600
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,080
worry about that I think the

601
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,320
presentation is going very well I'd also

602
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,900
like to remind everyone if they want to

603
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,240
pose you questions feel free to do that

604
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,120
on the Q a section we will answer them

605
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,460
by the end of our session and also if

606
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,320
everyone wants to contact you later they

607
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,559
can do that on your media platforms I'd

608
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,880
like to say that Roger is a very

609
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,179
qualified in his uh sector I would say

610
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,520
he's also holding the

611
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,919
certified ethical hacker certification

612
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
kudos to that you think we can resume

613
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,260
now and continue with our presentation

614
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,080
yes so uh like

615
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,679
okay so should I continue

616
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,740
yes absolutely thank you yeah thank you

617
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,799
so uh so somehow the nmap is not working

618
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,559
so we can go with that metasploits or if

619
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,980
I type msf runs soul

620
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,260
then it will run it will definitely run

621
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,179
because of the configuration which again

622
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,880
uh let me show you the configuration so

623
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,980
for the metasproid configuration it is

624
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,200
very simple what we are usually do is

625
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,679
like just hold the uh the script from

626
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,500
this particular uh GitHub user contained

627
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,779
and Rapid server link and just run that

628
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,400
particular by providing the uh

629
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,620
executable executable permission for the

630
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,039
two but what I I have did like uh I had

631
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,140
just uh created the configuration for

632
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,320
dbsql which create a blank uh database

633
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,659
which we have to done at the time of uh

634
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,640
like when we install freshly installed

635
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
metasput and we have to uh create the

636
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,620
database for the same that init is

637
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,659
nothing but creating the uh these

638
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,840
services and here uh this database dot

639
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,960
yml is nothing but it has the uh

640
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,179
configuration for the database so let me

641
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,480
tell you uh the configuration

642
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,140
um config and database.com so here you

643
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,059
will be seeing like the database name

644
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,179
the database user the password you can

645
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,799
change your password as per your

646
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,860
requirement your uh like whatever suits

647
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,039
you and the host again it is very uh

648
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,279
very common like we will run all uh this

649
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,799
particular database in the in in the uh

650
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,320
container itself but if I want to access

651
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,299
this particular database then what we

652
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,000
can do is like we just go to the docker

653
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,460
container command and we will provide uh

654
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,640
port forwarding for 5432 which is

655
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
support for the uh post trigger I mean

656
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,120
um postgres and we will provide a port

657
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,880
for uh for which we we are going to use

658
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,520
in our post machine so in that way uh

659
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,799
everyone can able to uh like connect

660
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,500
this particular uh instance of postgres

661
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,740
into your host machine so this is how

662
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,840
the configuration of Metasploit and yes

663
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,100
include beautiful uh Metasploit

664
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,740
uh Banner has been just released so you

665
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,600
can do anything which which you want

666
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,039
let's say

667
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,360
um

668
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,870
search search

669
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,929
[Music]

670
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,960
exploit

671
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
so it will provide you all the list

672
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,799
which you usually do in your virtual

673
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,960
machine so everything you are doing is

674
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,179
uh which is common in in this particular

675
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,240
tool now there is again a fun which I

676
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
again want to not show and not want to

677
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,580
discuss in the very first slides but I

678
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,200
want to show in the demonstrations right

679
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,299
so let's go with uh a bit part of Mobile

680
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,860
pen testing okay

681
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,919
so for uh so there are two things the

682
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,480
very first thing is like we you have to

683
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,880
connect your Android device to the ADB

684
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,580
driver to just kind of communicate with

685
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,460
your Android device but in iOS like if

686
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,899
you want to connect then you have to

687
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,539
create with the SSH uh connection that

688
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,779
is very uh very common so so if we if we

689
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,580
go here like you will be getting the

690
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,159
option for SSH so you don't need to

691
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,740
worry about that uh because I have the

692
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,840
limited resources I have only the

693
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,820
Android device right now that rooted

694
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,559
Android device so I can't be able to

695
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,140
show the demonstration of iPhone but for

696
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,480
the Android let me tell you uh how we

697
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,820
can connect to the ADB and

698
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,580
how we can go uh forward for the same so

699
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,760
for metastroid hanging for the mob SF uh

700
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
configuration you have to perform these

701
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,559
these uh configuration

702
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,640
and for that uh there is a

703
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,059
there is a virtual virtual environment

704
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,039
python virtual environment you can see

705
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,559
here v e and D so what you have to do is

706
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,539
like uh just

707
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,240
paste this particular

708
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,960
alarm

709
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,279
okay

710
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,460
so by this command it will activate your

711
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,640
python virtual environment okay now what

712
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,500
you have to do is like uh there is a

713
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,520
file run.sh which I have already

714
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,159
um provide the executable format so we

715
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,080
can just uh run dot

716
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,659
sh0.0.0.0 which is again uh

717
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,020
uh like you can you can call each and

718
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,899
every every uh network adapter for this

719
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,480
but by providing this IP

720
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,140
and we have to provide a port which we

721
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,940
have mentioned we have so now eight zero

722
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,559
eight zero eight zero eight one is

723
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,200
nothing but a port for uh like providing

724
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,899
the mob SF so you have to provide here

725
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,360
is uh six zero

726
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,659
uh I mean sorry you have to provide uh

727
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,720
eight zero eight one as far as

728
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,860
yes and provide by n so that it can run

729
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,960
in the background so as you can see here

730
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,140
uh we have just run our uh Mob SF

731
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,179
environment and it is running so once

732
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,220
you you click the enter it will go again

733
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,440
down to the background and uh you won't

734
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,539
be able to check what all the processes

735
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,320
is doing now if we go here and we we run

736
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,020
we have to run the port six zero zero

737
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,539
seven now there is a game change and the

738
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,340
game change is nothing but a very small

739
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,679
thing change so eight zero eight eight

740
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,539
zero eight one which I run inside the

741
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,360
container and six zero zero seven which

742
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,600
I use as a port forward now this port

743
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,299
forwarding work only on uh our host

744
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,980
machine so that you can able to access

745
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,720
whatever you are running inside the

746
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,940
container and like whatever you want to

747
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,980
access and you are post machine so this

748
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,220
is how uh this this uh beautiful tool

749
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,799
again uh will pop up you have to upload

750
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,200
the APK and do your other stuff so that

751
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,299
is the automatic file but if you want to

752
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,899
look say connect your Android device

753
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,700
connect with your Android device inside

754
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,279
that container then again there is a

755
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,520
there is a great tool called EDB uh ADB

756
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,299
connect

757
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,020
and 192 168

758
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,020
29.66.

759
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,460
um it will take time uh okay just a

760
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,880
second please

761
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,640
Roger thank you very much I would just

762
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,520
like to let you know that uh as for

763
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,460
currently it's only visible the vs code

764
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,799
and we cannot see how you're performing

765
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,960
and what you're writing so if you could

766
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,539
perhaps reshare your screen and everyone

767
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:15,240
would like to see your screen whenever

768
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,519
you are writing a certain comment thank

769
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,700
you oh I'm so sorry I thought uh we have

770
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,039
just here okay just a quick one okay

771
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,019
it's not a problem it's just because

772
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,360
everyone would like to see how

773
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,100
representation is going because it's

774
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,620
really interesting to all of us thank

775
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,739
you

776
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,019
um please let me know what screen is uh

777
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,279
visible to you like uh the the

778
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,440
terminal one right

779
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,740
yes now we can see okay

780
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,340
okay uh so like a quick one um

781
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,460
again like this particular msf console

782
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,500
which I have run so you can run each and

783
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,899
every uh commands from like whatever

784
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,020
you've done in your Linux machine

785
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,899
so like it is completely seen the the

786
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,820
nature of this particular tool is

787
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,859
completely same what you are doing in uh

788
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,020
let's say in your uh Kali Linux

789
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,119
environment in your Paratus environment

790
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,359
in your uh Ubuntu operating system

791
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,339
environment and any of the environments

792
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:29,820
so uh again if we go with the mobile pen

793
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,800
testing so these are these are the

794
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,119
functionality these are the features

795
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,879
which I haven't uh discussed in the very

796
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,800
first very few slides of the uh

797
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,780
presentation but I want to demonstrate

798
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,760
uh like live demonstration for the same

799
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,520
so that it can be uh like easy to

800
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,980
understand the things so like for the

801
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,800
Metasploit again uh this is uh like I

802
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,440
have just run this particular command so

803
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,159
and these terminal which again I will uh

804
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,980
repeat this thing so these terminals are

805
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,720
completely independent to each other so

806
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,580
whatever you are doing it here it is

807
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,740
completely different now if we go with

808
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,500
the mobile pen testing I had run this uh

809
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,960
more aggressive thing so that will come

810
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,420
that so you you will provide all the

811
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,579
steps in the readme section so you will

812
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,400
go through with that so and if anything

813
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,460
uh like make any hurdle for the scene

814
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,800
you can just pay me anytime on my social

815
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,260
media for example so okay coming to that

816
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,359
uh I have just created the uh mobile

817
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,000
safe environment and uh it created and

818
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,359
it started inside the uh 6007 which I

819
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,540
have mined the port forward now if I

820
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,520
want to connect my physical device to

821
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,740
this particular container then I just

822
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,859
run this ADB command and the IP address

823
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,280
and the port which is again a

824
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,380
default port for Android so it is

825
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,820
already connected it is showing because

826
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,160
I have just authenticated the request so

827
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,960
now if I want to run uh ADB shill so if

828
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,579
you can see here the terminal got

829
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,800
changed the user got changed and if we

830
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,160
go to the root user I'm also able to

831
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,960
root that because that phone is root

832
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,599
table from rooted form so

833
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,820
um if I

834
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,619
you can see the root user if I want to

835
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:16,320
PM list packages

836
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,660
so you can see all the packages which is

837
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,700
running inside that particular device so

838
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,579
it is it is again very simple and also

839
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:24,960
uh like

840
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,260
above Android 11 uh there is a very

841
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,119
great functionality to run this Android

842
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,880
uh like and Android debugging over the

843
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,160
TCP so I have connected over the TCP

844
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,520
there is no USB has been connected so

845
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,280
this is how uh the demonstration this is

846
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,780
how the working this is how the

847
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,880
architecture and this is how the

848
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,760
installation part of the nightmare so

849
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,820
I'm done with my uh the demonstration

850
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,500
thing so

851
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,760
uh any questions

852
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,880
thank you Roger again

853
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,619
my favorite presentation it was

854
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,560
wonderful it's very nice to see that we

855
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,960
can have a Docker image to contain every

856
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,280
single tool that we need as a

857
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,220
penetration tester and for now we do not

858
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,320
have any feedback from everyone I think

859
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,260
this is because your presentation was so

860
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,940
detailed and we understood everything

861
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,119
that you were trying to show to us one

862
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,440

863
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,200
