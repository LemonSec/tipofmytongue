will have his speech on over a decade of

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,920
software security

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,820
what we learned so uh Mr a short

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,239
introduction of Mr Adam Brown Adam has

13
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,399
been measuring maturity of software

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,520
security initiatives and financial

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,140
technology in government organizations

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,079

what you Adam let's get started

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,040
okay thanks thanks nazrat uh just before

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,740
I share my screen and uh I'll just say

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,060
hello so you can see me because I think

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,100
my I will disappear

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,020
um in in my talk yeah I'm going to talk

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,860
about

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,360
um the beasting which has been going on

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,180
for nearly 14 years now and I'm going to

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,820
cover five things that I said I would in

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,979
uh in the Preamble that is how to

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,920
measure software security

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,280
um security metrics really briefly a

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,860
little bit on holistic efforts why more

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,680
isn't always better and then trends that

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,720
we've seen in the last in the last

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,939
couple of years uh over the basic

44
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,459
measurements that that we've done so I

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,400
shall share my screen now uh please

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,459
shout out if you if you don't see it

47
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,660
yeah

48
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,160
looking forward

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,280
excellent okay so

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
um

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,180
yeah over a decade of software security

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,060
whatever we learned so um

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,940
let's just skip through that what I want

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,500
to do first of all is just differentiate

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,860
between what BCM is and to a synopsis

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
because sometimes when I've done talks

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,280
like this people say well who who's the

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,319
company well synopsis is the company and

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,360
it sponsors the vsim the bsim is uh an

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
open project that well at least the

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,860
output of it is uh is open in terms of

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,480
the document that is it's free to

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,560
download and uh and use as as you wish

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,060
uh so synopsis uh is a software security

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,280
uh company

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,780
um and uh bsim is one of the Strategic

67
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,900
kind of tools that that we use to

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,720
measure the state of software Security

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,620
in companies today so um we of course

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,659
deliver a strategic Consulting and

71
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,760
tactical Consulting and as you might

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,580
expect from any software security

73
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,099
company things like training penetration

74
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,319
Testing mobile assessments and

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,180
everything you see there so

76
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,340
um that's enough about synopsis

77
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,180
um

78
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,640
and and let's just get straight into uh

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,400
into the beasting

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,159
okay so

81
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,659
big Sim um

82
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,940
beaten 12 which is the current iteration

83
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,720
of it it's been going since uh 2008 so

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,480
it's uh it's coming up to 15 years that

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,340
it's been going on now and in that time

86
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,480
today we've we've done well over 550

87
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,400
assessments and that's been

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,340
contributions from

89
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,860
231 firms the way it's done it's

90
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,879
interview driven assessments and um that

91
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,280
that don't aggregate the actual

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
practices performed by the companies

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,900
that make up the data pool that drives

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,660
the Basin into a single observational

95
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,358
framework so it's a really good way to

96
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,340
identify the state of software Security

97
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,580
in the world today and uh and also how

98
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,520
you might stack up against your peers or

99
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,240
um

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,320
or uh of all of the other contributors

101
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,900
so just here's some of the the

102
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,479
contributing companies uh that work with

103
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,699
us to to do this

104
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,080
um not all of them obviously are listed

105
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
there and if you want to see a full list

106
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
well Fuller list download the beast in

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
not everyone is is documented in there

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,820
because for confidentiality reasons and

109
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,840
some

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,940
some contributors don't want to be

111
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,940
identified it's mainly us

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,400
um the the data pool three quarters of

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,060
it

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,440
and then in terms of the actual

115
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,919
verticals that contribute it's um it's

116
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,759
20 software creator software vendors and

117
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,320
the other well 28 is financial services

118
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,860
and Technology uh with 10 of fintech and

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,220
18 being Financial

120
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,060
so um what is it well it's we we collect

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,639
quantitative data so this is what

122
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,139
companies are doing and these are the

123
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,520
activities which I'm going to talk about

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,100
in in the first section of this talk and

125
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,100
then we also collect qualitative data so

126
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,380
this is well how those companies

127
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,840
achieving those things those activities

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,780
and that's described in the uh in the

129
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,000
description so we organized this using

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
something called the software security

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
framework you might see you know there

132
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,020
are some similarities between Sam you

133
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,580
know that's also a software security

134
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,780
maturity measurement tool and uh and uh

135
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,400
with a bsim we have a similar thing

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,039
instead of pillars we have domains uh

137
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,900
being starting with governance on the

138
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,280
left hand side so everything that you

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,860
need to manage the process to deployment

140
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,199
on the right hand side which is you know

141
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,539
that kind of engineering Grassroots

142
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,620
activities to ensure secure software so

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,360
and then in the middle of course we've

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,039
got practices so these sorry

145
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,380
intelligence these are the smarts that

146
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,900
you need you know to to create secure

147
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,699
software so there's things like attack

148
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,199
models in there

149
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,020
and then ssdl touch points which is what

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,600
we all know is about software security

151
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,060
it's you know pipelines and activities

152
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,000
around actually uh cutting code

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,340
um and then deployment which is where

154
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,680
you might see uh software environments

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
and configuration management and of

156
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,180
course pen testing which which we'll all

157
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,620
be familiar with so here are the

158
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,940
practices

159
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,440
um there are 12 practices they're

160
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,919
divided equally across the the domains

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,680
so in governance we look at strategy and

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,380
metrics balance and policy and training

163
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,240
and I won't read out the rest you can

164
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
you can see these slides available to

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
yourselves and there are three practices

166
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,520
per domain now inside each practice

167
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,639
we have a bunch of activities so I shall

168
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,580
just take an example here with training

169
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,120
and so inside training we have a handful

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,479
of of activities and they're divided

171
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,240
into levels

172
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,380
and each activity of course it's got uh

173
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,000
a reasonably long name there but it

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,880
could be slightly ambiguous so there's a

175
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,280
description behind each and each and

176
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,539
every activity to remove any ambiguation

177
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,460
so in here we're looking at training

178
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,340
level 1.1 and you can see 76 of

179
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,440
everybody that contributes the data the

180
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
76 out of 128 contributors uh do this

181
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,380
and and it just kind of so this is where

182
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,520
we're talking about

183
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,500
um software security awareness training

184
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,120
so it differentiates this that you know

185
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
this isn't obviously cyber security

186
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,240
training this is

187
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,919
um training that's made available to

188
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,020
software engineers and anyone involved

189
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,139
in the ssclc to help them create

190
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,160
um secure uh secure software so because

191
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,379
this is split into levels so level one

192
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,400
activities are the most commonly

193
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,680
observed

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,960
activities so of course they will be

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
probably slightly easier to conduct

196
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,419
but the BCM is a little bit different to

197
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,640
other majority models in that the levels

198
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,440
aren't like do this do this harder do

199
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,559
this even harder still it's um that the

200
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,880
most commonly observed all the way

201
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,820
through to the least frequently observed

202
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,480
and it could be at least you know a less

203
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,839
less frequently observed because uh it

204
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,220
could be a new activity right could be

205
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,660
something that we've detected people are

206
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,940
doing that we want to measure against it

207
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,860
could be that it's actually really hard

208
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,260
or quite specialist so there's a number

209
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,760
of reasons that you would have um

210
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,740
activities falling into into different

211
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,140
levels

212
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,880
so

213
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,580
um as part of the

214
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,459
um the measurement uh firms get a

215
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,440
scorecard and actually

216
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,540
um if you were to if you download the

217
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,220
BCM yourself go to beason.com and

218
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,140
download it and also I've got some QR

219
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,240
codes at the end or you know links that

220
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,060
you can use to to get direct access I

221
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,040
think there may be a paywall there

222
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,200
um not a paywall uh marketing wall so

223
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,839
you you can get direct access the um

224
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,899
the the scorecard drives the the rest of

225
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,360
the report so all of the graphs that

226
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,860
you'll see

227
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,160
um and it it just forms the the state of

228
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,019
um

229
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,399
the known state of software Security in

230
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,839
The Firm that's just been measured so

231
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,040
you can you can have a go at the

232
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,660
scorecard yourself

233
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,740
um you know look at all of the

234
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,180
activities they're all documented in the

235
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,700
Basin and try and work out if uh you

236
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,740
know if your firm is

237
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,740
um observed observantly doing these

238
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,220
activities or not just know that um

239
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,880
because firms do tend to uh be a maybe a

240
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,260
bit lenient with themselves and maybe

241
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,260
have a a an overall more positive score

242
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,300
than actually a calibrated assessor like

243
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,339
a synopsis assessor might be able to

244
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,120
deliver for you

245
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,580
um so yeah there are 122 of these

246
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,800
activities so it takes some time to do

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,540
these assessments

248
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,940
um I I'm in Copenhagen right now and

249
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,440
we've spent four days on site doing

250
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,940
interviews

251
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,180
um but the the output gives uh

252
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,820
leadership stakeholders context and

253
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,860
structure and potential prioritization

254
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,720
for activities that they might want to

255
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,959
to start

256
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,060
if they're not already doing so um I

257
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,160
said we will talk about

258
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,860
um some some metrics because the BCM is

259
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,519
kind of a in some ways a giant metric

260
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,140
um or it can be certainly if it's if

261
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,519
it's repeated

262
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,459
so organizations we saw are learning to

263
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,320
translate their risk into numbers we saw

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,380
firms putting more effort into

265
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,579
collection and Publishing of their

266
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,399
software security initiative data

267
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,279
demonstrated by a 30 increase in one of

268
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,740
the activities which is publish data

269
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,440
about software security internally and

270
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,540
we saw that increase over the last 24

271
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,740
months

272
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,019
and and the activity is really about

273
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,940
making information about what's

274
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,200
happening when you're creating this

275
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,899
software related to security activities

276
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,180
uh and then presenting that usually to

277
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,220
Executives or even you know uh

278
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,740
circulating inside the organization to

279
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,260
promote a culture of software security

280
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,660
so I just want to talk about metrics

281
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,000
versus measures because perhaps they're

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,079
used to interchangeably in businesses

283
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,899
um and some people assume that you know

284
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,700
that someone is talking about one thing

285
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,720
when when they're talking about

286
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,860
something else

287
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,320
so a really the the way I like to think

288
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,519
about it is is I use fuel or in a car so

289
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,440
um that's a measure right if I've got if

290
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,839
that gauge said 20 liters all it tells

291
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,420
me is I've got 20 liters it's up to me

292
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,339
then to work out what's that gonna do

293
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,860
for me how far am I get how far am I

294
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,360
going to get whereas

295
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,019
if I look at the metric from uh my car

296
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,420
it tells me it doesn't tell me how many

297
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,920
liters there are at all actually it just

298
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,320
tells me how far I can go depending on

299
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,820
my known driving state am I driving

300
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,220
really carefully or like a maniac

301
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,440
um if there's an electric car it would

302
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,640
take into account things like

303
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,920
temperature and so on it gives you range

304
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,980
so the point of the the parable is

305
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,560
um if you as the driver of the executive

306
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,720
um you know a seesaw or something you

307
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,639
want the kind of information presented

308
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,860
to you in the most easily digestible and

309
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,779
actionable way and that's the difference

310
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,260
between a metric and a measure metrics

311
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,560
provide a better comparative value over

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
collections of measures it gives

313
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,260
consistency in observation process and

314
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,260
consistency of course in meaning

315
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,000
so I just want to spend a couple of

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,399
minutes on

317
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,760
what's a security metrics must have and

318
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,279
must not have so there really must if a

319
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
software security measurement there's no

320
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,380
way other way it has to measure software

321
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,200
development lifecycle compliance

322
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,940
therefore you need to get Telemetry from

323
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,920
primary Gates

324
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,320
um and then it it must create a feedback

325
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,680
loop to enhance the ssdl it must look at

326
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,320
the data real data and and consider

327
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,200
factors of the program execution and

328
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,220
risk what it should do is correlate data

329
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,880
from multiple sources it should strive

330
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,000
for Good Time series data so it should

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,639
be repeated at a regular Cadence and

332
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,180
compare the value of of your efforts

333
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,000
you should test your theories your

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,040
intuitions and and perhaps it might

335
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,459
prove them wrong and it should tell your

336
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,880
application security if it's done right

337
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,100
um when metrics are broken

338
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,560
um you you've got to fix them otherwise

339
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,600
you know it's really quite pointless

340
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,940
you're going to tell people to go in the

341
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,440
wrong direction

342
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,920
um and they should ultimately enable you

343
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,240
to maximize uh your your spend on on

344
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,100
software security

345
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,740
and and that's why you should avoid just

346
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,240
looking at the bottom bullet point here

347
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,600
rushing metrics development you you if

348
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,220
you if you put the time and effort into

349
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,320
having a quality metrics program it will

350
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
be embraced by uh Executives and it will

351
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,199
Garner further investment maybe even to

352
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,639
your metrics program they'll want more

353
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,680
of that but also

354
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,199
um into actually the software security

355
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,639
initiative

356
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,100
so don't don't complicate the numbers

357
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,959
accidentally or intentionally just just

358
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,880
put some quality in there

359
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,620
and absolutely don't make up the numbers

360
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,260
and really don't make up stories about

361
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,279
made-up numbers

362
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,660
so what does the B Sim tell us about

363
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,699
metrics what did we see

364
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,660
um firms in the data pool do well we saw

365
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,560
um

366
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
an increase in the published data about

367
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,120
software security uh internally so just

368
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,660
53 percent of firms in bc12 although

369
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,320
that's up from 39 in in pc9 publishing

370
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,880
data about their software security

371
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,540
initiative within the organization so if

372
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,820
you compare that with 92 that have

373
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,279
identified gate locations so they've

374
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,760
identified Source sources of data for

375
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,940
their metrics which is up from 84 in

376
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,279
bsim9

377
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,620
there's they're not massively using that

378
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,260
data to to create uh create metrics

379
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,760
although they're kind of on a journey in

380
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,180
the last two or three years to do that

381
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,380
so

382
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,459
um only 16 of firms and that's only at

383
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,160
one percent from b79 are using metrics

384
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,199
really formally enough

385
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,079
to allow the firm to drive financial

386
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,440
decisions about their software security

387
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,160
uh initiatives

388
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,459
okay and that said uh I'll move on to

389
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,199
the next section because yeah we haven't

390
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,519
got too long

391
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,980
um this this is about

392
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,560
um putting in a together a quality

393
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,180
software security initiative I just want

394
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,820
to qualify this really so the software

395
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,320
security initiative is the thing that

396
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,540
we're measuring right now

397
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,860
um that needs to have a software

398
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,600
Security Group to drive it and it needs

399
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,040
sponsorship from executive management

400
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,500
but a software security initiative isn't

401
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,139
just doing a bunch of things like you

402
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,180
know let's do a bunch of pen tests so

403
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,680
let's just make sure we code review

404
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,839
everything it's got to be fairly

405
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,040
holistic

406
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,139
so if we look at this graph here this is

407
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,339
this is something that comes out the

408
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,440
Beeson report and and this one you can

409
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
get directly from from the Beeson report

410
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,400
you can you can download

411
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,059
um it shows uh the uh activities around

412
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,540
the clock related to the domains so

413
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,480
we've got the governance domain from uh

414
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,599
from 12 o'clock till two o'clock

415
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,660
intelligence from three till five and

416
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,400
and so on so you get the picture that's

417
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,720
what the spider chart's telling you

418
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
you've got the practices inside each of

419
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,299
those those domains there ultimately

420
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,980
um this is an aggregate of everybody

421
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,440
that's in the data pool so there are 128

422
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,660
participants and we um we we strive for

423
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,940
data freshness so if if a firm hasn't

424
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,880
re-measured within uh within uh just

425
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,620
under three years then they dropped from

426
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,539
the data pool because of course there's

427
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,280
no point analyzing data that's 10 years

428
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,600
old we want to look at the state of

429
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
software security initiatives today

430
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,320
um

431
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,960
so the 128 firms this is this is kind of

432
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,640
what they're doing you can see there's a

433
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,980
bit of a dip in attack models firms

434
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,419
aren't necessarily doing that but

435
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,059
they're they're they've got a good grasp

436
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,200
on standards and requirements so

437
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,160
ultimately and of course you're going to

438
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,799
see this with a with 128 firms all all

439
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,620
contributing to this average you're

440
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,539
going to see a fairly rounded shape and

441
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,820
when you perform your own measurement

442
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,620
really what you're also looking for is

443
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,419
is at least in kind of Fairly rounded

444
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,700
shape and those rounded shapes aren't

445
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,620
necessarily always that common what

446
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,660
we're seeing here in in this graph is a

447
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,640
comparison of different verticals from

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,620
the data pool so

449
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,679
um the the green uh section is uh is

450
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,100
cloud firms the light blue section is

451
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,400
Internet of Things firms and the purple

452
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,600
section is um is uh software vendors so

453
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,740
you can see they've got slightly

454
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,740
different uh shapes and that's because

455
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,780
of the the different kind of Market

456
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,000
forces that are in play on them maybe

457
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,700
they have to be heavily regulated or uh

458
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,559
or or maybe they're they're highly uh

459
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,500
highly Technical and therefore

460
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,860
um you know you get get the technology

461
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,539
right more quickly

462
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,940
so what you don't want to see in your

463
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,919
score is you know big spikes or big

464
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,980
drops big troughs in there here's

465
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,900
another way of looking at the data this

466
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,419
is what we call The Equalizer chart

467
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,780
and it's a good way to identify you know

468
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,600
what you might call a hollow practice so

469
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,100
you've got the level one activity to the

470
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
bottom the level two activities in the

471
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,340
middle and in yellow you've got the

472
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,620
level three activities this actually

473
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,200
represents a fairly good

474
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,480
um holistic strategy barring one thing

475
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,419
there there's nothing happening in

476
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,179
security testing which is odd given how

477
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,340
everything else seems to be fairly

478
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,020
well-rounded they've got a good

479
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,880
foundational set of level one activities

480
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,640
and two uh and there's a there's a

481
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,880
smattering of level three activities

482
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,220
another uh

483
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,480
Pitfall might be if you had a bunch of

484
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,160
level three activities but not the level

485
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,380
one and two activities you'd have to ask

486
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,120
the question

487
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,280
certainly leadership would ask you why

488
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
are we doing all these like weird not

489
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,360
not necessarily weird sorry but uh

490
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,240
Specialists rare less common things but

491
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,580
we're not doing the basics so it's just

492
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,500
a good way to to measure out what we're

493
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,280
doing so a really useful metric for I

494
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,380
you know to prove your own performance

495
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,720
here is is what you can get from from

496
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,140
this graph what we've got across the um

497
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,760
the the x-axis is buckets of scores so

498
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,220
you can score up to 122 you know there

499
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,440
are 122 activities I don't think

500
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,260
anyone's ever scored 122 but some firms

501
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,679
in the 61 to 122 uh bracket there are 10

502
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,720
firms that have managed to get there

503
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
that's the rightmost bar whereas on the

504
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
leftmost side you've got some firms

505
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,620
there are always that 12 12 firms have

506
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,120
got a score between 0 and 20. now the

507
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,880
Orange Line tells you the average age of

508
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,220
the software Security Group that's

509
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,320
driving the software security initiative

510
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
inside the firm so it starts to reason

511
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,580
that those with a lower score have a

512
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,559
more nascent group

513
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,660
um whereas those with a higher score

514
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,760
have got a much more mature group that's

515
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,700
been in place for a fairly long time

516
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,820
now the green is is in this case this is

517
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,280
this firm's measurement and they have

518
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,039
scored 47 right so they go into the 41

519
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,020
to 50 bucket and uh the typical software

520
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,240
Security Group age for that book it is

521
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,400
around about four and a half years old

522
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,740
however their software Security Group is

523
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,780
only three years old so they're out

524
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,700
performing

525
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,820
um their competitors or counterparts

526
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,260
depending on how you slice the data

527
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,000
right this is this is everyone that's

528
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,679
part of the data pool but they're doing

529
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,820
something right they're doing something

530
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,140
better or are they doing something more

531
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,700
quickly maybe they have more sponsorship

532
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,400
but it's a good way to to measure your

533
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
software security initiative is one one

534
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,280
metric at least

535
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,840
okay so that's that's firms that are

536
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,400
actually in play

537
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,620
um what another useful thing that you

538
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,740
can pull for from from the um

539
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,080
is how to how to Kickstart how to

540
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
bootstrap a software security initiative

541
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,460
to pull yourself up by your own

542
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,320
bootstraps it's very hard or as Baron

543
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,480
von Munchausen here is doing he's uh

544
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,640
pulling himself out of a swamp by his

545
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,520
own ponytail it's about self-starting so

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,260
where would you start if you just

547
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,460
started as an application security

548
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,140
manager or director and and you're

549
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,320
responsible for this this thing this

550
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,539
initiative which is software Security in

551
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,500
The Firm

552
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,559
but what we saw was there are two types

553
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:53,880
of um uh uh software security initiative

554
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,159
there's a governance LED and there's the

555
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,740
engineering LED add to that in the

556
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,740
report we talk about emerging

557
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,460
um

558
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,820
uh emerging initiatives so just starting

559
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,340
from scratch so these are firms that are

560
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,919
taking ad hoc activities and moving to a

561
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,960
more holistic strategy we looked at

562
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,760
maturing

563
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,880
um uh initiatives so an existing

564
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,860
initiative tied to Executive

565
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,600
expectations and they're tasked with

566
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
improving things all the way through to

567
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,200
enabling

568
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,760
um uh SSI so this is uh software

569
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
security initiatives that are achieving

570
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,659
software security at scale of expertise

571
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,340
and coverage and Tool integration and

572
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,440
accuracy and so on so actually there are

573
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,940
six different ways that you could pitch

574
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,039
yourself you could just be a beginner

575
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,659
and governance fled or you could be

576
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,299
maturing and engineering and there's

577
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,799
some useful information that leads him

578
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,500
for you to uh to digest in there

579
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,140
if we look at what firms are doing you

580
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,020
can see the governance lead guys start

581
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
with a compliance and policy type of

582
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,179
activities so

583
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,100
um one of the most important things that

584
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,220
they'll do and I would say well it is

585
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,380
vital for a success of a software

586
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,360
security initiative is to create the

587
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,120
software Security Group hire someone or

588
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,340
get someone

589
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,720
to take ownership of the software

590
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,360
security initiative and that person has

591
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,539
to have a fairly uh close or direct

592
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,580
reporting line to Executive management

593
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,460
one of the things we look for is um

594
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,740
they collect data on the the reporting

595
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,960
line to the CEO because no software

596
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,000
security initiative will be successful

597
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,240
with our executive sponsorship

598
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,340
um if you look at the bottom they've got

599
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,740
the engineering LED uh kind of

600
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,120
activities

601
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,280
um so those guys start with things with

602
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,260
low friction stuff so

603
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,200
um the security features and design type

604
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
of activities so these are to integrate

605
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,280
and deliver security features that

606
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,440
Engineers can just pick up and and use

607
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,299
in in their own code or they engage

608
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,559
directly with the architecture team to

609
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,000
help them with things like threat

610
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
modeling and

611
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,000
design review

612
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,280
and then in the middle we've got both

613
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,960
engineering and governance-led which of

614
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,480
course yeah if you work together you you

615
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,440
probably um start with more and and you

616
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,799
get better traction

617
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,860
so just to start with

618
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,220
um so if you're a governance-led

619
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,460
um a person in a in in a firm and you've

620
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,900
got to you've got to create this

621
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,520
software security Initiative for some

622
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,840
reasons maybe there's an executive

623
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,299
decision we need to address software

624
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,659
security first thing you must do is put

625
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,700
someone in charge of the software

626
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,919
security initiative and give them what

627
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,360
they need for success

628
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
sponsorship with Executives probably

629
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,380
some budget some power

630
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,500
the next thing is to inventory your

631
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,720
software so know what you have know

632
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
where it is and when it changes now it's

633
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,100
not just me saying these things this is

634
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,340
what we've observed firms doing this is

635
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,120
this is how people how firms do it right

636
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,460
then once you've invented decide on the

637
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,700
scope you can't boil the ocean so decide

638
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,960
what you're going to focus on first and

639
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,700
then contribute to its work streams

640
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,140
regarding infrastructure don't put good

641
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,000
software on bad systems in poorly

642
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,980
constructed networks of course

643
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,779
um you've got to get that right

644
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,179
um because those those systems are

645
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,159
typically Cloud systems these days but

646
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,100
make sure the configuration is is secure

647
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,580
do perform defect Discovery so determine

648
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,100
what today's issues are what is your

649
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,559
technical debt pile looking like and

650
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,880
then plan for tomorrow it's always

651
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,640
painful because you know you you find

652
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
things and it looks like things are bad

653
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,720
and engineering are going to complain

654
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,279
because they've got extra work to do but

655
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,659
you know it is stuff that needs to be

656
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,279
fixed and then you've got to Define how

657
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,320
you're going to fix it so you need to

658
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,220
engage with uh with uh developments or

659
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,860
find those responsible for delivery

660
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,460
pipelines or key designs or or code

661
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,440
pieces and and involve them in the

662
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,539
planning and implementation roll out at

663
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,580
scale of your your activities

664
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,260
um so and to start with the controls

665
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,240
that establish some risk management to

666
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,059
prevent recurrence of the issues that

667
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,679
you see today right so the things that

668
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,000
you found in defect Discovery how you're

669
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
going to prevent them happening in

670
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,179
future and that's where feedback loops

671
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,740
start to come in place

672
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,380
and then Implement your own feedback

673
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,960
loop metrics are great for this as well

674
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,559
um

675
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,260
start with the bite size approach expand

676
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,299
the team improve your inventory automate

677
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,640
the basics and and then add more

678
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,520
prevention and then repeat again

679
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,400
so what about engineering LED well there

680
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,860
are some similarities of course you know

681
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,740
inventory or software and with scope

682
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,020
though engineering engineering-led

683
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,320
groups have been observed using these

684
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,020
three things as input for prioritizing

685
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,260
their scope so velocity and so teams

686
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,659
conducting active and new development or

687
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,640
major refactoring There's an opportunity

688
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,779
to to to to to move and regulation so

689
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,240
services or data repositories with

690
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,880
specific requirements for security or

691
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,140
privacy

692
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,500
an opportunity so teams solving critical

693
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,659
technical challenges or adopting key

694
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,179
technology can be Proving Grounds for

695
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,400
emerging security controls

696
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,159
again don't book on software on poor

697
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,600
infrastructure

698
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,419
um and then choose your application

699
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,520
controls that deliver the right features

700
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,100
and prevent some classes of

701
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,580
vulnerabilities software features a

702
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,100
secure security features and designs of

703
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,559
you know reusable

704
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,900
libraries and authentication mechanisms

705
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,240
role-based Access Control Systems and so

706
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,960
on

707
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,860
and again repeat

708
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,840
so we're seeing the merging of

709
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,940
governance-led and engineering-led

710
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,740
efforts around software security and

711
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,120
it's something that we've definitely

712
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,860
tracked in the bsim and we've seen that

713
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,200
for the last two or three years

714
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,340
historically there was like this

715
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,919
centralized governance view a team at

716
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,600
corporate maybe called the app Tech Team

717
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
or the software security team or product

718
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,860
security team and they were setting

719
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,539
governance and buying tools and running

720
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,299
them centrally and setting policy to for

721
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,059
build permits and and you could only get

722
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,919
gate passage if the tool said it was

723
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,059
okay

724
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,120
um now that was okay for the time but

725
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
now it's too slow and Engineering moves

726
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,080
too fast

727
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,480
now we see that security is happening in

728
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,460
the engineering organizations and firms

729
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,500
in engineering there might be Cloud

730
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,559
security or container security or devsec

731
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,419
or secop so these are the people that

732
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,100
are popping up and growing inside

733
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,039
engineering so we have the rise of the

734
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,320
second generation engineering-led

735
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,480
security efforts

736
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,360
so well that's great the thing is these

737
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,580
individual silos don't necessarily know

738
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,399
what it means to manage the risk for an

739
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,580
entire firm so we see that we're soon

740
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,559
driving towards a hybrid where

741
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,539
centralized governance of application

742
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,460
security and distributed democratized

743
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,260
engineering of application security must

744
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,480
come back together so that we can agree

745
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,260
on meeting both feature velocity and

746
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,419
Cadence

747
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:29,539
in the engineering teams but not risking

748
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,659
the whole organization

749
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,960
in short Engineers don't see what puts

750
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,260
the firm at risk and governance guys

751
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,880
don't have a view of what causes

752
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,980
friction for engineering

753
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,779
so what we're seeing here these three

754
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,360
three three circles is uh it's a general

755
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,760
view of two cultures that are often at

756
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,340
odds engineering groups want to deploy

757
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,220
application features and get quickly

758
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,380
customer feedback and governance groups

759
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,240
want to manage risk across the entire

760
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,640
application portfolio

761
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,460
so the diverging properties and

762
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,860
priorities aren't going to go away well

763
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,260
devsecops can help stakeholders meet in

764
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,659
the middle and the new BC activities

765
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,880
that we've been measuring are definitely

766
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,760
reflecting this growing change so you

767
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,380
know devsecops has been talked about for

768
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,779
years and we're actually seeing it which

769
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,940
sign is science is proving that it's

770
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,679
actually happening in the measurements

771
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,840
that we're performing

772
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,260
um so Engineers want feature velocity

773
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,720
they want to automate first they want

774
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,240
resilience they want to test in the

775
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,799
value stream and they don't want

776
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,520
production environments to be sacred

777
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,260
whereas the governance guys want rules

778
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,360
and checkpoints and compliance and

779
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,919
centralized testing and they really want

780
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,080
to remove all risk

781
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,779
but there are shared goals for example

782
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,820
resiliency it means something slightly

783
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,799
different to each group by and large the

784
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,120
engineers want resiliency so that

785
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,799
software doesn't just fail at the first

786
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,899
sign of adversity maybe the DNS went

787
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,820
down or someone ran a chaos monkey

788
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,220
against it they want the software to be

789
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,039
good and robust by and large the

790
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,179
governor's guys want to know if

791
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,100
someone's attacking the firm through the

792
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,480
software they can do something about it

793
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,600
not necessarily through log analysis and

794
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,100
Incident Management but that the

795
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,840
software is secure enough that it can

796
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,940
protect itself against the attack that

797
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,559
is it doesn't have the vulnerabilities

798
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,179
in it in the first place that the bad

799
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,559
guys are looking for

800
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,419
so what resiliency means slightly

801
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,159
different things in each Camp it is

802
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,299
somewhere where the two can come

803
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,820
together it can start to think what does

804
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,380
this mean for rows instead of what it

805
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,740
means independently because it considers

806
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,380
risk posture tone at the top resourcing

807
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,880
and other things

808
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,419
so in summary putting tools into a CI CD

809
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,440
chain

810
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,080
uh with some devops teams it doesn't

811
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,000
necessarily make devsecops

812
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,200
um hopefully what you can see is really

813
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,740
about culture and it's about integrating

814
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,340
um

815
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,000
what you're doing uh so it's much more

816
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,559
about just integrating tools

817
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,559
so final section really here this is

818
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,799
that the trends that we've observed in

819
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,100
in software security activities so we

820
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,700
track these activities taken or

821
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,820
facilitated by software security groups

822
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,799
and of course they change over time and

823
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,779
that's why we have data this data

824
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,539
freshness policy and and they change in

825
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,100
line with software Security Group

826
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,080
priorities

827
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,600
a good measurement interval for firms is

828
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,419
about 24 months sometimes it's 18 months

829
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:37,980
so that that means that you know they're

830
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,539
doing a beat Sim every couple of years

831
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,240
and so let's then look at the the

832
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,940
differences between bcm12 the current

833
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,940
iteration of bsim and bsim10 from a

834
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,480
couple of years ago

835
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,500
so there's been an emphasis on uh supply

836
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,960
chain software security we're seeing

837
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,120
that um obviously we hear about it

838
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,120
marketing wise but we're seeing it um

839
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,679
through the BC lens as well through what

840
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,260
we're observing and and of course high

841
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,879
profile ransomware attacks have probably

842
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,739
driven that software security attacks

843
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,339
are driving it these increases in these

844
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,500
related activities

845
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,899
so with regards to open source software

846
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,619
and there's been a 60 increase in the

847
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,359
identification of Open Source software

848
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,339
and then a control of the use of Open

849
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,739
Source software so commonly this is

850
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,899
achieved using some automated tools to

851
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,839
find binaries whole libraries or even

852
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,960
Snippets of cut and paste code

853
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,379
um the engineers have used

854
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,599
um I think what you can say is a few

855
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,219
years ago we used to say that there's no

856
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,699
excuse for not doing static analysis and

857
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,739
and it's fairly ubiquitous these days

858
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,359
these days you can probably include

859
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,820
software composition analysis in that

860
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,619
statement too

861
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,740
so with vendors there's been almost a 60

862
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,060
increase in the observation of firms

863
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,880
putting software security specific

864
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,240
service level agreements slas

865
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,339
um into their contracts to make sure

866
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,320
that the vendors don't jeopardize the

867
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,420
firm's compliance story or or their

868
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,040
actual you know software security

869
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,680
initiative so Provisions are typically

870
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,540
around things like policy conformance

871
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Incident Management uh training defect

872
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,180
management software issue response times

873
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,180
so they are I mean you probably will

874
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,099
commonly find

875
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,460
um cyber security slas in there but but

876
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,460
some you know what we look for here is

877
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,720
is actually

878
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,760
um software security related stuff so

879
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
you know it could be training or you

880
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,880
know doing code review and doing it

881
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,180
properly

882
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,579
okay so s-bomb is an acronym that's

883
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,760
become uh very popular over the the last

884
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,560
last few years

885
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,160
in um in the 2020s Ghana had predicted

886
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,820
Gartner had predicted that um by 2024

887
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,160
the provision of a detailed regularly

888
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,320
updated software bill of materials by

889
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,020
software vendors will be a

890
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,240
non-negotiable

891
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,940
for at least half of enterprise software

892
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,980
buyers

893
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,839
um and and it has done

894
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,660
um because we've seen this increase in

895
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,440
um

896
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,320
in in the in in the use of a software

897
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,359
bill of materials and of course it's

898
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,160
never practical as a manual effort and

899
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,740
firms are using tools to identify open

900
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,060
source in the first place

901
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,940
one thing we didn't see is

902
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,240
the automation of malicious code

903
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,859
detection

904
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:50,520
in fact only one firm out of 128 had

905
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,280
actually successfully done this

906
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,220
um it's hard right it needs the use of

907
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,740
automation to detect things like back

908
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,500
doors and logic bombs

909
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,720
um dangerous code like time bombs or

910
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,300
nefarious communication channels denied

911
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,460
code injection obfuscated program

912
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,920
language a program not logic sorry

913
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,619
anything that could be targeted as a

914
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,780
backdoor attack

915
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,260
so custom rules in in a static analysis

916
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,300
tool can be used to codify acceptable

917
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,880
and unacceptable code patterns and and

918
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,900
while not all back doors and similar

919
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,420
kind of dodgy functionality Were Meant

920
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,900
To Be malicious but they do tend to

921
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,900
remain in deployed code and should be

922
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,020
treated as malicious until proven

923
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,599
otherwise and so hopefully we'll see an

924
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,900
uptick in in in subsequent Visa

925
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,320
measurements

926
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,200
there's been a shift towards continuous

927
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,380
defect Discovery and and continuous

928
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,079
effort so we said years ago there's no

929
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
excuse for no sastin and then now it's

930
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,980
becoming no excuse to an osca as well

931
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,560
and and it's increasing right um we're

932
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,359
seeing dast getting into pipelines

933
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,280
interactive application application

934
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,780
security testing getting into pipelines

935
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,520
Cloud security posture management

936
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,320
getting in right at the air you know

937
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,839
really in in production in the last uh

938
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,900
24 months

939
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
um

940
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,700
we're seeing more uh granularity

941
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,500
um that the decomposition of these

942
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,420
security gates so instead of like one

943
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,119
big one saying go no go there's been a

944
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,579
drive to test early and test often and

945
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,800
this is seen firms decomposing efforts

946
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,720
into smaller timely uh checks so data

947
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,220
indicates important efforts like

948
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,180
incremental security design efforts

949
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,420
um conversion of manual effort to as

950
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,079
code efforts satellite Outreach and and

951
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,839
automatically automated asset Discovery

952
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,260
are happening

953
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,760
so we've coined this phrase shift

954
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,140
everywhere

955
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,160
um

956
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,800
there's there's been a realization that

957
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,740
sometimes deployment orchestration or

958
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,740
post-deployment environments are uh the

959
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,700
earliest and best possible time uh to to

960
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,820
do some tests so shift left

961
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,339
we're still so familiar with it really

962
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,079
becomes shift everywhere

963
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,420
or shift right as in you know shift

964
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,099
correctly

965
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,339
um shift appropriately it extends the

966
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:30,900
idea of making security testing

967
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,940
continues throughout the software life

968
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,700
cycle so that means smaller faster

969
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,040
pythonium security tests are conducted

970
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,040
at the earliest opportunity

971
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,740
that could be a design uh you know

972
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,839
looking at the the designs and breaking

973
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,520
the design or it could be all the way in

974
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,920
production with uh Cloud

975
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,359
um Cloud security posting management

976
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,240
tools that are monitoring asset creation

977
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,000
and configuration uh monitoring of those

978
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
created assets

979
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,680
so finally

980
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,400
um

981
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,920
we're seeing governance of code AS code

982
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,300
in uh bcm12 observations indicate that

983
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,060
Soul Source uh software security

984
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,240
standards and policy documents so those

985
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,220
things that said Thou shalt do this and

986
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,980
must not do other things

987
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,599
um moving from you know document based

988
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,220
artifacts to becoming human readable

989
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,220
configuration code or simplified code

990
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,320
that conducts vulnerability Discovery

991
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,300
and this is really the essence of

992
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,280
software development lifecycle

993
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,599
governance

994
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,260
um and and that's been seen in uh we've

995
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,480
seen a 15 increase in the last two years

996
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,720
of firms firms doing that

997
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,259
foreign

998
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,760
slide now um there's some other trends

999
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,339
that we observed and a couple of things

1000
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,320
that we hoped for but didn't necessarily

1001
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,660
see too too much of

1002
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,500
um

1003
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,820
there's been a shift away from mandating

1004
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,440
software security big stick kind of

1005
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,240
approach like you've got to use my tool

1006
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,220
because I bought it and the CEO says so

1007
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,200
it's a more of a partnership kind of

1008
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,079
collaborative approach uh with sharing

1009
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,200
of staff and resources and knowledge and

1010
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,359
and actually contributing directly

1011
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,579
towards software security efforts in the

1012
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,000
critical path of software delivery

1013
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,520
uh there's been significant really

1014
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,740
significant increases in observation

1015
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,460
rates for uh the application this

1016
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,079
activity application containers to

1017
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,619
support security goals and orchestration

1018
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,180
for containers and virtualized

1019
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,920
environments that doesn't mean like oh

1020
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,140
yeah we're using kubernetes so we're

1021
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,780
secure it's more of a case of that is an

1022
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,240
opportunity to make sure that your

1023
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,560
environment is secure through

1024
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,359
configuration hardening and benchmarking

1025
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,780
and standards and so on

1026
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,220
and

1027
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,060
we saw organizations are learning how to

1028
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,440
translate risk into numbers uh we saw a

1029
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,079
30 increase in in the activity published

1030
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,740
data about software security internally

1031
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,320
um however

1032
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,900
what we didn't really see a big increase

1033
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,660
in it was the normalizing and

1034
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,780
deduplication of defect data and

1035
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,380
customizing testing tools and that's

1036
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,000
important because that's about the

1037
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,260
quality of the data that you're

1038
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,820
reporting so while firms are kind of

1039
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,460
getting some measurements and and in

1040
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,859
some cases metrics

1041
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,720
um we probably need to see an increase

1042
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,640
in the the quality of data that's going

1043
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,040
in right so you if you automate noise

1044
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,680
reduction using aggregation tools and

1045
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,780
you know things to or to make kind of

1046
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,220
false positives

1047
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,220
uh being dried correctly and then if you

1048
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,160
actually customize testing tools so they

1049
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
don't you know come come home with

1050
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,180
inaccurate results in the first place

1051
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,440
then we can see metrics get even better

1052
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,740
um there were very few instances of um

1053
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,380
normalizing and de-duplicating defect

1054
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,640
data and customizing uh testing tools

1055
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,540
um

1056
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,240
so so anyway next thing was that there

1057
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,300
was uh we didn't see the creation of uh

1058
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,880
context that were security requirements

1059
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,880
so this includes the use of pre-approved

1060
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,619
security Frameworks and design patterns

1061
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:32,599
um

1062
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:36,180
abuse cases so you know secure patterns

1063
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,119
that the engineers can use and and the

1064
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,800
security features that you can just roll

1065
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,150
into your code

1066
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,099
[Music]

1067
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,440
um okay excuse the drill noise sorry

1068
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,000
it's a noisy Hotel this one it seems so

1069
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,339
in conclusion well first of all please

1070
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,859
do take a look at the bsim

1071
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,240
um all of this information I've

1072
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,640
presented is in that report there's a

1073
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,560
Trends and insights report that's uh

1074
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,440
almost like the tldr version and then

1075
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,300
there's a foundations report which is a

1076
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,760
fairly weighty tone with all of the the

1077
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,240
activities inside of it

1078
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,020
so

1079
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,700
in summary

1080
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,440
um you can't there's no switch to turn

1081
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,300
Security on you can't just say hey can I

1082
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,280
have that book in Secure mode you really

1083
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,200
must build it in and increasingly we're

1084
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,599
seeing automated ways to do that the

1085
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,980
goal should be order to build

1086
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,920
governance's code uh automating manual

1087
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,260
compliance to Darren's tasks makes a

1088
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,240
more consistent efficient and repeatable

1089
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,040
um use metrics use them to help the

1090
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,900
decision makers make the right decision

1091
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,240
about software security I guess it's

1092
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,560
easy to say all the guys at the top

1093
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,760
don't know what's going on but you

1094
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,680
really have to kind of maybe it feels

1095
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,160
like doing the job for them but you know

1096
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,560
you're as the kind of experts on the

1097
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,119
ground you can actually translate it

1098
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,619
into terms that they can really

1099
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,420
understand so consider multiple

1100
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,319
disciplines Cloud containers

1101
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,020
um orchestration Security Source content

1102
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,099
management

1103
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,920
and measure what you can and make it as

1104
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,920
as relevant as possible for the firm

1105
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,040
um to make decisions

1106
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,960
have the right activities running at the

1107
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,020
right right time to implement small

1108
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,920
phase-based security activities

1109
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,780
throughout the life cycle rather than

1110
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,740
using big slow pass fail Gates that

1111
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,380
delay pipeline progress

1112
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,480
um and then use a Telemetry that comes

1113
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,040
from these things gather data on what

1114
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,319
tests run what was found and and use

1115
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,759
that to drive improvements

1116
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,839
um where you should start so yeah if you

1117
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,880
are starting out if you're optimizing or

1118
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,160
if you're actually doing really well

1119
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,140
there are there's information in the BCM

1120
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,839
that that can help you in the in not

1121
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,660
that we as uh the custodians of the data

1122
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,400
will will directly tell you it's more

1123
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,160
what your peers in the data pool are

1124
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,200
doing and you know it could give you

1125
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,980
some ideas as to where to go next

1126
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,819
so

1127
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,780
finally as we've seen with bsim

1128
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,540
maturation continues and we look forward

1129
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,839
to seeing what BCM firms are doing in um

1130
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,760
when we release Vision 13 which will be

1131
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,400
towards uh well probably in the Autumn

1132
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,140
of uh of this year

1133
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,720
okay so thank you very much I think I've

1134
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,420
finished in just about enough time if

1135
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,880
there's any questions please uh

1136
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,000
uh yeah well let me hand over to nazrat

1137
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,380
who can tell you what to do about

1138
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,740
questions

1139
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,740
well Adam thank you very much for the

1140
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,180
great presentation

1141
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,700
tons of information and

1142
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,400
I really enjoy thank you so much so I

1143
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,520
would look into the uh participants

1144
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,359
questions and uh probably if you can

1145
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,760
take your time maybe we have 10 minutes

1146
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,200
to answer the participants uh questions

1147
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,020
so we got a question it says what's the

1148
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,260
what are the major difference between

1149
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,400
Sam and

1150
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,859
be safe

1151
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,680
uh yeah good question uh thank you so

1152
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,799
um

1153
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,300
some uh is

1154
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,079
um

1155
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,640
I think they were created around about

1156
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,040
the same time actually

1157
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,660
um some is um is uh has got a bunch of

1158
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,579
activities it's got domains and and

1159
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,839
practices but it it perhaps lacks a data

1160
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,920
pool

1161
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,800
um so it's perhaps a bit prescriptive

1162
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,660
whereas

1163
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,880
um BCM is different in the it's

1164
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,460
descriptive so it measures what's

1165
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,980
happening in in the industry and then

1166
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,740
that shapes the the Basin so what you

1167
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,540
might find is you know some quite

1168
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,920
rightly might take some of the new

1169
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,720
activities that are observed as growing

1170
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,280
in the bsim

1171
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,060
um

1172
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,839
and use that uh I think that yeah so so

1173
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,240
the the major difference is it has a

1174
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,220
data pool behind it and and therefore

1175
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,380
it's descriptive

1176
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,220
um

1177
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,359
um and it is uh yeah but similarity wise

1178
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,160
it is a report that we put out every

1179
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,780
year I don't know if some do that I

1180
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,160
guess they do

1181
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,240
um

1182
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,520
uh which can can help you define your

1183
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,319
software security initiative but I'd say

1184
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,619
prescriptive versus descriptive

1185
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,380
okay thank you uh very much like me move

1186
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,240
to the

1187
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,700
um second question from the audience

1188
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,480
so

1189
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,700
the second question is who can deliver

1190
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,040
BCM assessment

1191
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,200
well the good news is

1192
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
um you could you could try it for

1193
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,880
yourself so there's a scorecard in there

1194
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,619
and there's all the activities in there

1195
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:58,619
and all the descriptions in there so

1196
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,599
there's nothing to stop you

1197
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:01,980
spending time to do an initial

1198
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,599
assessment and and sometimes you know

1199
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,480
for for nascent uh software security

1200
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,319
initiatives might be even if if you

1201
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,599
spoke to somebody in a synopsis they

1202
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,460
might actually turn around and say don't

1203
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,440
don't do a beating with us

1204
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,960
um just go and start yourself because

1205
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
you know we can probably tell you now

1206
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,000
your score is going to be quite low

1207
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,520
so go and work out what you need to do

1208
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,040
to shape your SSI to kick it off and

1209
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,599
then maybe get a proper measurement in

1210
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,160
in a couple of years

1211
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,000
um

1212
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,420
so uh in in terms of uh who who else can

1213
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,839
measure it to do a a direct measurement

1214
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,940
well of course we do and we with the

1215
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,619
custodians of the data pool if you are

1216
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,900
measured your data can go into that data

1217
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,099
pool

1218
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:50,339
um and uh and it's how to become part of

1219
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,680
the uh the bsim

1220
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,339
um

1221
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:57,180
uh Club if you like there's a

1222
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,140
a conference and uh and forums and so on

1223
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,240
that are pretty active

1224
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,480
uh I guess some Consultants independent

1225
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,040
Consultants would do that you would miss

1226
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,839
the data pool um you would miss the

1227
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,940
collaboration sorry not collaboration

1228
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,319
calibration

1229
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:18,780
so as a as a a a a calibrated assessor

1230
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,900
the idea is whether you use me or one of

1231
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,579
the consultants in New York within a

1232
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,200
couple of points we we should come up

1233
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,420
with with the same score we actually the

1234
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,579
interviews are driven usually with with

1235
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,300
three three assessors all calibrated

1236
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,380
whereas if you're not part of the

1237
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,300
calibration process you can't guarantee

1238
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,240
that the score is going to be really an

1239
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,920
accurate reflection of what everybody

1240
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,599
else in the data pool would have scored

1241
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,000
if they if they use synopsis

1242
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,559
oh thank you Adam and uh we got a

1243
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,200
question and

1244
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,540
it says my company is a bit specialist

1245
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,839
how can the business relevant to

1246
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,920
companies who are not mainstream

1247
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,359
so

1248
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,460
um

1249
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,640
they when the business started in 2008

1250
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,339
it was with the nine original firms in

1251
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:14,160
the US so think of some big names and

1252
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,780
you can probably work out who they were

1253
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,579
we're talking about financial services

1254
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,720
organizations on on the east coast and

1255
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,500
um

1256
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,319
software companies Cloud companies on

1257
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,300
the west coast and the original photos

1258
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,619
we're going to have to have two models

1259
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,619
because surely Banks make deal maintain

1260
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,020
software

1261
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,339
uh in a very different way to software

1262
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,300
companies

1263
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,099
and after doing these measurements and

1264
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,200
creating the software security framework

1265
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,140
it was realized that actually no

1266
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,460
ultimately they're all producing

1267
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,680
software and they might be doing it in

1268
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,260
slightly different ways but you can

1269
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,640
really harmonize a lot of the activities

1270
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,780
that are happening which is what we've

1271
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,099
done with with the activities and

1272
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,020
continue to do every year

1273
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,099
and so there's there's no no special

1274
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,500
snowflakes if you like I I think if

1275
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,880
you're creating software if you're

1276
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,380
maintaining software it's relevant if

1277
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,880
you're not doing that then yeah it

1278
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,740
doesn't make sense but we have in the

1279
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,720
data pool everything from like iot

1280
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,680
vendors telcos cloud service providers

1281
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,640
all the way through to Banks and and

1282
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,200
governments

1283
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,599
um there's 122 activities no one ever

1284
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,819
really scores 122 altogether although

1285
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,740
some do score quite highly because you

1286
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,940
know that some of the perhaps

1287
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,380
Specialists more more slightly

1288
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,079
specialist for activities like highly

1289
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:32,660
governed um

1290
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,160
organizations will you know we'll

1291
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,079
probably do better in in governance

1292
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,200
whereas uh you know super technical

1293
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,300
telcos might do better with technical

1294
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,819
testing and and so on but it fits

1295
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,079
everybody every firm

1296
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,359
uh well thank you very much uh I think

1297
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,160
we got three questions and probably

1298
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,460
everyone have time so it's the end of uh

1299
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,440
probably the QA session

1300
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,520
so uh do you have something extra to add

1301
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,220
Adam no I'd just like to say thank you

1302
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,960
very much for your uh your attention

1303
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,119
today uh it's been a pleasure yeah

1304
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,640
pleasure is mine thank you very much so

1305
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,520
let's wrap up this session uh probably

1306
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,500
the first session of executive track
