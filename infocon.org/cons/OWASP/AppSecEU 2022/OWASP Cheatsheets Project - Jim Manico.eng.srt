1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,540
okay good morning good afternoon good

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,900
evening depending on where you are

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,300
welcome to the breaker track my name is

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,980
Jerry lieberthal

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,859
and I'm a volunteer in the OAS Community

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,740
I am a security architect and

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,320
application security engineer for CGI

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,039
and I will be monitoring the session

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,199
normally we would say during the next 45

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,000
minutes you'll be listening to Jim

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,660
maniko talk about his topic which is the

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
cheat sheets but in this case we're

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,980
going to deviate just a little bit and

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,320
allow him to talk about his OAS projects

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,559
overall so that means you need to submit

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,620
your questions in the Q a tab just to

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,559
the right of the video in hoova I will

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,840
be seeing that and trying to intersperse

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
them in real time rather than waiting

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,440
for the last 10 minutes

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,260
so note that the chat function you see

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,079
and zoom is disabled but you can leave

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,019
comments in chat in the chat tab in

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,780
Hoover which will be monitoring so with

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,420
Jim uh with that as an intro take it

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,760
away please say hey Jerry can you see my

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,700
screen hear my voice see my face all

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,140
right we're working here it's working

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,100
here hello to OAS appsec EU hello to all

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,420
my European friends who care about

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,939
application security this is the end of

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,520
the conference it's been five tracks I'm

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,640
here at RSA in San Francisco this

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,920
morning is my flight morning a little

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,380
optimistic in Booking this so I'm gonna

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,259
condense my my two talks for this hour

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,439
and next hour into one hour and my goal

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,740
is to show you what I do at oasp I don't

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,479
have power I have power points for all

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,460
these talks but instead I want to

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,240
showcase what the project is and what I

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,340
do to help maintain this project I want

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,960
to show you how some of the sausages

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,659
made in particular then there's a reason

45
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,380
I'm doing this my goal of this talk is

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,720
to get you to participate in these

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,880
projects in some way and it's very easy

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
to do so if you're inclined to do if

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,440
you're inclined to do so so let me start

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,480
with the OAS cheat sheet Series this is

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,180
the oldest project I worked on I want to

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,520
give a lot of credit to three people who

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,400
really started this project this the

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,739
original cross-site scripting cheat

55
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,319
sheet was written by Jeff Williams the

56
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,020
original cross-site request forgery

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,060
cheat sheet was actually written by Eric

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,700
Sheridan many years ago and these

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,800
individual cheat sheets that were not

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,080
part of a big project but these

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,140
individual cheat sheets became

62
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,519
extraordinarily popular in particular

63
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
the xss cheat sheet that Jeff Williams

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,980
wrote over a decade ago that was one of

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,220
the most popular Pages ever to hit the

66
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,620
owas foundation and then Dave Wickers

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,300
jumps in and starts building a SQL

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,879
injection cheat sheet and I'm like we

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,340
got to make this a project so I I wrote

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,560
a rapper project around these cheat

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,860
sheets and began managing the project

72
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,519
and over time I've had several different

73
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,500
co-managers for a while elar Lang and

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,420
Robin came in and helped automate some

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,300
of the project right now Jacob markowski

76
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,480
is is called leading the project because

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,700
we get a lot of edits coming in and it's

78
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,860
our job to check and merge and comment

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,080
on these edits to make sure the project

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,599
gets done but let's look at this what is

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,120
the OAS cheat sheet series it's a OS

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,340
cheat sheet series was created to

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,440
provide a concise collection of high

84
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,379
value information on appsec topics these

85
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,900
cheat sheets were written by hundreds of

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,180
different appsec professionals have

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,360
participated in this project to help and

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,580
I know we're in the breaker track I

89
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,840
don't know why I'm here I'm not a

90
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,299
breaker I'm a builder this is really a

91
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,640
builder project please don't leave it's

92
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,080
still we'll still talk about these

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,900
things but this is a project primarily

94
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,239
for software developers trying to write

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,040
secure code and let me show you what the

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,640
topics are like here's our first one uh

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,340
the authorization cheat sheet Ajax go

98
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,260
look at the Access Control cheat sheet

99
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,939
and we renamed it the authorization

100
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,099
there we go

101
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,420
so what's going on we're talking about

102
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,940
enforce lease privilege deny by default

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,100
validate permissions on every request

104
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,620
and other I I feel very important

105
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,780
principles around writing secure

106
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,540
software when one of the one of our

107
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,660
really sharp authors was asking about

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,360
rewriting our older cheat sheet they

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
took my commercial content some of the

110
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,020
principles I talk about they looked at

111
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,720
asvs standard they look at the masvs

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,880
standard they looked at the nist

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,860
standard on attribute-based access

114
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,199
control and kind of grabbed all the info

115
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,940
all that information and built this

116
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,759
cheat sheet so what is this cheat sheet

117
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,440
now this cheat sheet if you look at it

118
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,160
is actually in GitHub as is markdown

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,199
right there's authorization cheat sheet

120
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,259
so this is all it is this is this is the

121
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,500
content the GitHub content and if you

122
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,380
want to participate in the project we

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,919
take pull requests what I ask of you as

124
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,800
a volunteer is go through the list of

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
cheat sheets and if you take again right

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,560
here is is GitHub OAS cheat sheet series

127
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,520
tree master cheat cheese this is the

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
main gold of the cheat sheets and you'll

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
see some haven't been touched for 10

130
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,600
months some have been edited days and 15

131
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,820
days ago got some got some click jacking

132
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,400
edits a real old school category what I

133
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,380
would ask of you if you care about this

134
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
project is to take a look at the at the

135
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,139
various cheat sheets that have had the

136
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,199
least editing like TLS cyber string

137
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,240
cheat sheet TLS ciphers have changed in

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,820
15 months I would love to see a TLS

139
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,440
expert look at that cheat sheet and give

140
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,479
us an update because that's basically

141
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,180
what I do I scroll down I look at PHP

142
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,220
configuration cheat sheet I might have

143
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,080
to deprecate that if we don't get edits

144
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,020
within within the within 24 month window

145
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,820
but I would love help just to go check

146
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,220
this out and and that's it that's the

147
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,320
whole project honestly the whole project

148
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,000
is it's a giant living

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,139
Encyclopedia of not look at all these

150
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,880
ggs there's a lot of them we got a lot

151
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,580
going on here this is and I kind of see

152
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,160
this if you're an old owasper

153
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,940
you'll see that the the wiki was where

154
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,440
we did a lot of the cheat sheet light

155
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,199
work I kind of see this as a successor

156
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,440
to our original Wiki around secure

157
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,500
coding content and we get a lot of hits

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,660
here I think this is a really important

159
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,580
project not because of my work who cares

160
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,220
about me but because of the hundreds of

161
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,120
really top tier authors and volunteers

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
who've helped make this project happen

163
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,419
now let me show you a little bit about

164
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,979
how the sausage is made what am I going

165
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,020
to do I got issues anyone who knows me I

166
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,259
got issues and we see

167
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,440
we see various like help wanted

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
waiting for feedback I got about what do

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,620
I got I got 42 issues that's a lot of

170
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,120
issues what's going on with Draco let's

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,319
go take a look at these issues what do

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,039
you got

173
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,780
Draco

174
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,139
yeah I'm gonna close the issue goodbye

175
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,080
so this just doing doing making some of

176
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,180
the sausage what else I got here

177
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,660
Json web token cheat sheet for Java

178
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,940
authentication cheat sheet password

179
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,139
storage questions one of my favorite

180
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,940
argon2id fall back is B Crypt blah blah

181
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,180
blah

182
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,599
um

183
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,419
I want to remove bcrypt and it's damn 72

184
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,919
byte limit I agree with that so what are

185
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,319
we doing here so instead of a giant PR

186
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,419
so what am I doing here this this

187
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,639
person's asking me for let me show you

188
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,080
the cheat sheet in question I'm not

189
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,580
again I'm just showing you how the how

190
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,460
the sausage is made here password

191
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,080
storage cheat sheet yeah I could just

192
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,460
click on it in the left but I'll just

193
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,440
Google it there we go password storage

194
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,720
cheat sheet and my recommendation I

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
worked with some hashcap people my

196
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,400
recommendation is use argon2id 15 Megs

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,900
of memory iteration count of two one

198
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,599
degree of parallelism boom and if you're

199
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,660
not going to use argon we go s Crypt I'm

200
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,800
sorry if you're not going to use argon

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,720
we go beat and if not be Crypt s

202
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
Crypt and if you're doing federal

203
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,800
government system pbkdf2 this is pretty

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,440
conventional wisdom for password storage

205
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,539
in the current ERA I brought in a

206
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,940
mathematician from the hashcat team to

207
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,740
help me come up with all these specific

208
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,199
numbers and recommendations and we even

209
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,080
see the ietf picking up some of this

210
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,140
like if I go to the ietf for password

211
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,899
storage right they have a they have a

212
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,299
standard from Kitten hey kitten what's

213
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,520
up kitten and if you would take a look

214
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,839
at their at their recommendations for

215
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
pbk df2 there it is

216
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,300
they're suggesting they grab my value

217
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
310 000 that's not an arbitrary value

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,399
that's math from the hashcat team and

219
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,140
they pick that up as well I think I

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,519
thought it was kind of interesting so

221
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,440
we're like dueling standards this is a

222
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,740
European this is uh oh wash cheat sheet

223
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,839
take it take whatever you want so what's

224
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
going on here what are they asking for

225
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,920
does it make sense change your

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,839
recommendation to go first use argon

227
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
then s-crypt then beat Crypt then pbk

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,820
df2

229
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,360
yeah I I just agree so let me I I I I

230
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,540
just I just agree

231
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,620
so let's do it

232
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,399
so I'm gonna I'm gonna do this right now

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,440
to show you how again my goal is to show

234
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,000
you how the sausage is made a little bit

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,060
so I want to go edit this now so I I'm

236
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,040
lame I go to GitHub desktop it just

237
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,080
makes my life so much easier I don't use

238
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,440
manual git forgive me I'm old and gray

239
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,779
with with low time so I'm gonna go to

240
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,399
the cheat sheet series I'm gonna pull

241
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,279
origin here I'm gonna go grab all the

242
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,140
latest goodness right

243
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,660
and I I just like to I want to make sure

244
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm looking at the right I show it and

245
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,680
find her oh I feel embarrassed here and

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm gonna go look at the password

247
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,060
storage cheat sheet I'm just going to

248
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,740
pop this thing open in Sublime Text

249
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,820
that's it

250
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,279
and so let's take a look at this

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
now what they're saying is he's like get

252
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,399
be Crypt to be third and I I'm so happy

253
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,560
because I hate beat Crips the 72 byte

254
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,360
limit really really frustrates me with

255
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,760
decrypt so I'm going to say

256
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
uh

257
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,040
if our I'm gonna say if Argon

258
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm going to say this I'm going to say

259
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,160
if argon2id is not available

260
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,160
[Music]

261
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,760
um

262
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,319
if argon2 is not available

263
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,660
um

264
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,579
yeah use s-crypt with a minimum CPU

265
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,980
memory cost parameter of 216 a minimum

266
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,959
block size of 8 10 24 bytes and a

267
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,820
parallelism parameter one it's a way

268
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,700
stronger algorithm I like that and I'm

269
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,620
going to say if

270
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,440
uh uh what do we say here let's go back

271
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,940
let me go back to Chichi what did I say

272
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,839
before I said for legacy systems yeah

273
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,120
I'm gonna call B Crypt Legacy I'm so

274
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,779
happy

275
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,240
oh so this is my happiest moment in the

276
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,700
cheat sheet I because B Crypt if your

277
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,920
password's more than 72 bytes it should

278
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,839
be Crypt truncates so a lot of the

279
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,880
conventional wisdom is to pre-hash or

280
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,100
just Lim I'm just like forget it it's

281
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
time to stop using beat grip and use

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,700
something that adults use like argon2id

283
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,860
adults don't use B Crypt it's an old

284
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,320
crappy algorithm with the limit

285
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,240
prehashing is problematic stop it damn

286
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,399
it all right I'm sorry so what am I

287
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,680
gonna say for legacy systems using B

288
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,899
Crypt that's what I want to say so for

289
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,120
for this is my happy for legacy systems

290
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,899
using

291
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,399
right for legacy systems using bcrypt

292
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,540
go back

293
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,620
I gotta say I gotta use right English

294
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,100
for legacy systems using B Crypt

295
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,120
use a work factor of 10 or more and with

296
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,100
the password limit of 72 bytes I'm happy

297
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,720
with that

298
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,660
and so let's go look at the list now the

299
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,579
basics so peppering yeah don't ask about

300
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,180
the pepper password hashing argon2id

301
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,279
it's already in the right order s script

302
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,880
B Crypt so I'm good this is my PR use

303
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,100
argon 20 minimum commercials it's good

304
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,220
if argon 2 ID is not available use S

305
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,200
script

306
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,779
for legacy so this is a b crib I love it

307
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,660
so now let's let's let's make this let's

308
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,680
do this

309
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,060
so let's just commit right to master no

310
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,260
Jacob I like to just commit to master

311
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,060
because I'm Jim and Jacob's like stop

312
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,940
that Jim stop it he's right so what am I

313
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,500
gonna do what am I actually gonna do I'm

314
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,740
gonna say if you might remember this

315
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,680
oh yeah you can see my my GitHub and

316
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,079
competency love it so I want to make a

317
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,180
new Branch right yes and I'm going to

318
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,540
call this uh password password cheat

319
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,880
sheet reorder and I'm gonna create a

320
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,220
branch I hate doing I'm going to

321
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,880
bring my changes to password CS reorders

322
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,980
there we go now I'm in my little branch

323
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,040
and I'm like chain I'm changing the

324
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,380
order of where are we so I'm grabbing

325
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,180
this comment so I can tie it all

326
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,819
together changing order of B Crypt

327
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,320
be cripped and S Crypt

328
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,040
you know cuz because B

we go PR we got this already listed so

343
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,180
now now I'm in the project let's go back

344
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,100
so I got my PR submitted I'm going to

345
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,320
pull requests what do we got here update

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
the password storage GG let's check this

347
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,139
out

348
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,620
files one check my change out just a

349
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,500
nice simple reordering

350
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,180
I'm gonna push this left

351
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,600
so now I wanna we have so much project

352
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,880
automation here

353
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,540
so and I Gotta Give like elar and Robin

354
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,579
elar in particular built a lot of this

355
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,220
elar Lang he's one of the leads of the

356
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,079
asvs standard

357
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,019
he built a lot of automation so I so he

358
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm not allowed to check stuff in or

359
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,060
emerge Until I Pass all the limping

360
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,920
checks oh I hate this but I'm gonna do

361
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,779
it now we're so what are we doing here

362
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,339
we're doing our lint we have four

363
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,959
different lint Checkers and standard

364
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,000
Checkers they've all passed

365
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,860
let's merge without waiting for

366
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,660
requirements to be met they want let me

367
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,019
so what do we got reviewer

368
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,180
because we so they request I didn't

369
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,459
request it so I'm I'm gonna be admin I'm

370
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,019
a squash and merge confirm and merge

371
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,260
this so as soon as I do this it actually

372
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,880
I'm gonna delete that we don't need that

373
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,199
Branch anymore

374
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,380
so as soon as I do this it merges live

375
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,740
into the project so in theory if I did

376
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,019
this right

377
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,420
we should see that push live in just a

378
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,579
few moments so I'm gonna go back to the

379
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,279
the issue that we that we just submitted

380
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,180
to

381
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,399
what am I doing update the past that's a

382
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,920
PR I don't that should be gone now right

383
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,620
yeah it's gone I'll go back to my issues

384
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,680
got a lot of issues

385
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,800

let's close this issue out boom back to

393
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,779
the password storage cheat let's see if

394
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,199
we got this refresh come on push it live

395

397
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,800
that's okay we'll check it out in a bit

398
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,120
let me go back to the master Branch here

399
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,920
I might do something else let's see what

400
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,959
else is going on in this project we'll

401
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,760
come back we'll see if we actually got

402
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,320
this live it takes a minute or two let's

403
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,699
go to the pull request what's going on

404
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,759
here add guidance on secret scanning

405
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,860
Network capture on kubernetes and fix a

406
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,440
typo so what's this what'd they change

407
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,079
yeah editors to headers that's easy and

408
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,959
this is open source tools like secret

409
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,899
scanner is that open source yeah it's in

410
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,360
threat mapper

411
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,220
this is like a commercial thing what do

412
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,380
you think should I allow if you have

413
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,000
questions by the way if you're actually

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,740
still here you're welcome to hit me up

415
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,000
with questions right now but what's

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
going on I have a uh a question that

417
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,419
came in for you Jim

418
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,000
go for it yeah the question was in

419
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,919
reality is it practical to recommend

420
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,780
this to developers and let them check

421
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,540
when coding

422
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,520
what in particular all of this stuff or

423
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,400
well I'm guessing any individual cheat

424
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,699
sheet or all of them

425
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,199
the question is should we what now

426
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,940
should we let developers read cheat

427
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,860
sheets and learn about secure coding I'm

428
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,480
not sure if I if I got the question

429
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,900
right well it says do you think it's

430
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,360
practical to recommend the cheat sheets

431
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,740
to Developers

432
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,200
and have them follow some of that

433
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,059
through while they're coding I

434
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,220
absolutely because it's a living

435
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,740
document we're constantly tweaking and

436
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,039
changing it and I know it's kind of like

437
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,140
it's challenging to try to make

438
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,660
developer security Engineers but if

439
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,660
developers want to learn about security

440
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,340
this is a pretty good place to do it I'm

441
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,020
really proud of this series again not

442
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,419
because of my efforts but because of the

443
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,880
efforts of so many abstract people who

444
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,860
really care about this stuff and so I

445
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,919
think the answer to that is absolutely

446
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,780
absolutely yes well let's uh let's

447
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,840
follow on a little bit with that uh as a

448
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,720
developer I kind of expect that some of

449
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,299
the tools I have cover

450
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,280
things like this although they don't

451
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,160
incorporate the cheat sheets

452
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,260
commercial tools actually link to the

453
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,059
cheat sheets I see several static

454
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,980
analysis engines and dynamic engines

455
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,320
that have links to this and uh

456
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,780
yeah I I you know it's not very code but

457
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,000
I've seen one or two maybe fortify does

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,380
it

459
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,100
um

460
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,260
maybe is there something they could do

461
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,500
to put these together and say okay you

462
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,660
guys have to learn what reasonable

463
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,020
secure coding is here's a whole bunch of

464
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,020
stuff look at things that are in your

465
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,660
Arena and make sure you're following

466
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,840
them

467
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,700
I mean

468
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I think that there's a mo there's a

469
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,000
multitude of ways that the cheat sheets

470
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
can be used and I've seen some people

471
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,100
cherry pick certain cheat sheets and

472
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,140
have their developers read it I some

473
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,000
I've seen some people point the whole

474
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,620
cheat sheet series to their developers

475
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,660
and have them read it I've seen some

476
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,299
people like do really surgical edits

477
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,860
that were helpful and then give it to

478
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,260
their developers to read so I've seen

479
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,299
people you can download this as well you

480
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,360
can just go to like the main page and go

481
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,220
to yeah I'm gonna download the whole

482
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,440
site here and go grab a whole zip of the

483
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,419
entire bundle and and not even go

484
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,299
through the series but work use it you

485
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,280
know internally in private there's an

486
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,320
atom feed of all the main updates here I

487
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,700
mean like

488
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,799
is my latest yeah we see Blaze couple

489
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,120
updates you just pushed I'm gonna stop

490
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,299
that

491
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,100
think of it as just like an encyclopedia

492
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,020
that's changing

493
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,720
every couple every week or so

494
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,640
that's about secure coding who doesn't

495
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,900
want that this is one of the most

496
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,240
popular Flagship projects at the OS

497
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Foundation right now so I think I would

498
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,799
agree with you on that and I I use them

499
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,160
quite a bit they do seem to change much

500
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,620
more rapidly than obviously any of the

501
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,760
standards

502
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,000
yeah which is great

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
oh cool yeah so I'm I'm I'm going to

504
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,320
ship to another I'm gonna shift to

505
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
another project in just a moment I'm

506
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,500
just showing you how the sausages is

507
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,720
made I'm looking at these edits the real

508
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,720
real minor edits so I'm like I'm pushing

509
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,140
my PR's live right now yeah let's squash

510
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,880
and merge that I'm an admin it's okay I

511
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
know what I'm doing I'm a professional

512
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
don't worry

513
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,200
what else do we got here any more PR's

514
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
interesting what do you got here

515
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,780
check the changes yeah I'm squash like

516
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,720
what is this oh it's the security policy

517
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,799
I want to actually they want to secure

518
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,260
somebody asked for a security policy on

519
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,000
the project itself so I'll come back to

520
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that that's it I've cleaned up my PR's I

521
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,340
have mostly pending issues waiting for

522
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,960
next steps let's let's uh nope I'm good

523
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,520
with that

524
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,260
anything else major I want to do

525
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,179
nope I can also take a look at like

526
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,160
issues I have my name attached to it

527
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,740
which are like nine right now

528
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll come back to that my own time

529
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,299
but folks that's that's the oh wash

530
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,100
cheat sheet series that's what this is

531
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,340
all about right and so it's it's a

532
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,880
living encyclopedia we're here to like

533
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,740
primarily build a resource uh

534
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,720
primarily want to want to build a

535
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,919
resource that is going to help

536
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,900
developers write secure code

537
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,120
it's something that hundreds of people

538
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,360
are working on it's it's a one of the

539
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,960
flagship projects of the OAS foundation

540
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,299
and I'm showing you how the sausage is

541
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,020
made to encourage you to participate as

542
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,360
well not that terribly difficult to do

543
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,220
so

544
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,860
all right and there we go and let's end

545
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,840
with this so here's my edit using

546
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,539
argon2id which amendment config if argon

547
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,340
280 is not available use s-crypt with

548
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,500
the minimum CPU cost parameter blah blah

549
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,780
for legacy systems using beatcrypt use a

550
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,100
workfire Kenner more the password limit

551
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,500
is 32 bytes there we go so I just made a

552
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,419
little edit I took someone's feedback

553
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,760
from the community I agreed with them I

554
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,500
made the edit pushed it live to the

555
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,940
project manager even though that's bad

556
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,919
and we have a little edit that I think

557
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,020
is kind of decent right we want to be

558
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,659
Crypt is a less secure algorithm than S

559
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,179
script let's get let's live our an Argan

560
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,419
2id has three configurators to slow it

561
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,240
down s script has two configurators to

562
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,100
slow it down and bcrypt has one so this

563
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,939
is the right thing to do

564
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,520
and we're live that's the cheat sheet

565
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,179
series

566
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,460
let me show you the the second project

567
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,380
that I'm working on now and this is a

568
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,500
bit older of a product it's the OAS

569
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,559
proactive controls right

570
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,320
the OS proactive controls was pushed out

571
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,679
in 2018. this is an older project at

572
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,080
this point and where the reason I think

573
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
this is interesting a lot of control wow

574
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,299
a lot of contributors we're just about

575
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,960
to get started on the next version of

576
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
the proactive controls this was this

577
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,260
came about in like 2017 we published in

578
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,140
2018

579
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,880
and the point was what was the point of

580
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,460
this the point was to

581
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,640
come up with the top 10 list that was a

582
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,580
hundred percent defensive in nature the

583
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,919
oauth's top 10 as it stands today is an

584
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,260
is basically an international standard

585
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,179
it shouldn't be

586
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,059
but it is it's an international standard

587
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,880
on application security and it talks

588
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,340
about risks right it talks about things

589
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,919
that can go wrong in your app when we

590
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,440
talk about the proactive controls

591
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,559
we're talking about the the various

592
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,679
things that you need to get right when

593
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,480
building software defining security

594
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,940
requirements so we agree on what

595
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,000
security is leverage security Frameworks

596
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,539
and libraries secure database access

597
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,659
encoding validation identity

598
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,179
Access Control Data protection

599
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,220
cryptographic data protection

600
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,740
implementing security logging and error

601
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,179
handling I don't like error handling I

602
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,320
want to get that out of the list there's

603
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,120
bigger things we can point to than just

604
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,220
error handling but this is our take

605
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,500
Circa

606
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,299
2018. we've it's been translated to

607
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,659
several different languages and super

608
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,419
eager to mature the project and so what

609
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,220
we're doing right now is we're getting

610
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,520
ready to start the 2023 Edition that's

611
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,380
our plan for release of the next version

612
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,220
it's coming up and so we're we're very

613
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,840
likely going to take the OAS top 10 and

614
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,000
parallel it right if you look at the OAS

615
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,880
top 10 today how could we convert the

616
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,740
oauth top 10

617
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,140
into let's get a list of the OAS top 10.

618
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,020
there it is how could we convert this

619
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,880
list right here

620
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,659
into a uh into a defense list let's

621
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,580
let's think this out for a second right

622
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,320
let's go get a new little Sublime Text

623
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,360
here here's the oauth's top headed today

624
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,120
so broken Access Control what would be

625
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,380
like so let's say proactive controls 01

626
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,419
that would be

627
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,559
um Implement right implement

628
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,840
implements you know act Implement Access

629
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,299
Control access controls something like

630
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,940
that right now we look at P what I want

631
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,039
to do is just move again this proactive

632
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,860
control list to a very to parallel the

633
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,380
oauth top 10. so you know Implement

634
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,120
action control I want you to stop

635
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,799
injection

636
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,740
um that's two so uh sorry sir P2 is you

637
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,860
know protect

638
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,140
protect data right po3 cryptography po3

639
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,659
is you know stop injection

640
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,640
I hate to say like an attack I might

641
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,679
even I may swap out injection for

642
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,059
something better because we're trying to

643
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:21,960
say this is what you want to build

644
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,179
securely but I digress a po4 is uh do

645
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,640
um design review

646
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,220
threat modeling right

647
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,539
okay we're looking I'm building the

648
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,720
oauth project controls 2023. I'm taking

649
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,279
the oauth's top 10 you know implement

650
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,299
good security configuration

651
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:49,500
p06 is you know you know keep your

652
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,320
components

653
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
updated

654
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,299
p07 is

655
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:03,320
what's po7 po7 is you know implement

656
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,120
digital identity

657
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,760
p08 what would that would po8 be POA is

658
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,919
software you know

659
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,740
um implement

660
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,279
foreign

661
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,880
implement

662
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,360
data integrity

663
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,279
and almost done po now I'm going to add

664
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,539
this to the project just so we have a

665
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,220
reference and like implement

666
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,520
security logging

667
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,620
I was going to say security people say

668
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,080
logging and monitoring logging logging

669
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
implies that I'm just gonna say logging

670
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,279
for now so oh and 10 is

671
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,559
uh

672
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,340
so stop ssrf

673
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,880
see I don't this doesn't

674
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
remember well but we'll start we'll

675
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,020
start here this is not terribly bad and

676
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,580
so I'm gonna go back to the project here

677
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,860
go to my GitHub here and I'm going to

678
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,159
submit an issue yeah yeah

679
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,659
and say

680
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,659
you know getting ready for the

681
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,659
proactive

682
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,520
azti active controls 2023

683
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,480
and here is a first take of an oauth's

684
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,940
top 10 like

685
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,820
proactive list

686
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,220
and let's see see

687
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,020
no I'll just leave it there so there we

688
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,740
go

689
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,380
this is like our very first steps at

690
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,000
getting this project rolling we're doing

691
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,620
it all together

692
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,440
it's a great day for freedom and again

693
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,059
the goal of this is to come up with an

694
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,140
oh a clone of the OAS top 10 that is

695
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,679
purely defensive in nature and all if

696
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,299
you want to participate all you need to

697
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,059
go to the OAS proactive controls group I

698
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,980
love some comments there's only two

699
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,260
issues here this this is a quiet project

700
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,600
right now not a lot of activity so if

701
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,940
you have an interest in building an OAS

702
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,640
top 10 list for defense

703
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,299
hop on in give me some comments in the

704
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,279
proactive controls comment and let's

705
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,039
talk about it you'll see some more like

706
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,159
loud activity later in the year this is

707
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,000
Katie Anton who is actually I'm going to

708
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,799
CC her into this so she can see me do

709
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
this Katie Anton's the co-lead of this

710
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,140
she's fantastic Katie has worked really

711
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,720
hard on this project

712
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,720
um one and the other Project Lead he had

713
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,000
his company sold and retired that's

714
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,240
terrible when my company sells and I'm

715
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,279
rich because I sold some company I'm not

716
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,260
yet I'm not working on it I'm gonna

717
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,419
still participate in OAS that's been my

718
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,220
promise to the foundation I don't want

719
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,059
to like

720
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,580
well if I do well it's because of owass

721
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,080
so I plan to stick around for a long

722
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,299
time I love this stuff

723
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,600
how we doing do I still have my uh do I

724
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760

so there you go we went through the we

727
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,240
showed how the sausage is made for the

728
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,880
cheat sheet series The proactive

729
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,520
controls project these are two of the

730
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,080
things I'm working on let me show you

731
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,840
one more right and I would go look at at

732
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,620
Josh Josh Greenberg who's the main lead

733
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,220
of the OAS asvs standard but I'm part of

734
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,899
the asvs team and I'm going to do a

735
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,279
little work in front of you so where am

736
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,500
I going I'm going to go to there's

737
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,720
GitHub for asbs let me go back to the

738
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,000
root directory for a second and there we

739
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,419
go we're working on 5-0 right now so if

740
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,640
you want to participate in the asvs

741
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,419
standard this is where I would go o wasp

742
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,960
asvs tree master 50 English this is the

743
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,700
main working directory and you'll see

744
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,520
activity last month in similar so we

745
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,919
have 81 issues we get a lot of feedback

746
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,299
on this from the community it's

747
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:15,679
uh asvs discussion

748
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,140
yeah yeah I'm gonna so let's go look at

749
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,240
what do I have does anyone asking me to

750
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,799
participate there we go

751
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,600
allow list of H so what do we got here

752
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,539
asvs 5.13 requirement is

753
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:34,679
um

754
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,679
not all HTML form Fields can be verified

755
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,779
through an allow list free form text

756
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,520
Fields allows HTML to be entered I agree

757
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,139
where possible allow lists

758
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,200
so preferably allow lists alternatively

759
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,940
sanitizers he's exactly right

760
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,220
so

761
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,559
we merged a small fix there already

762
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,700
you know they're like oh manico you

763
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,940
merged it too quickly whatever yeah well

764
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,059
you know it takes different kind of

765
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,799
personalities I think to make a good

766
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,279
project Josh and elar are very like

767
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,740
let's be careful about how to move

768
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,080
forward and I'm like

769
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,020
let's let's merge let's merge some

770
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,120
that's that's kind of my attitude so

771
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,100
I'm always trying to push things forward

772
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,659
they're trying to talk about it

773
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,399
carefully and I think the combination of

774
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,740
both is is what we do well

775
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,480
anyways let's go look at this

776
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,399
requirement five one three let's see

777
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,620
what it is as it stands today so go to

778
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,520
English

779
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,240
want to go to five

780
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,140
five one three verify all using the

781
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,240
allow list where HMO markup is accepted

782
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
for input refer to requirement 52521

783
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,860
yeah I love that

784
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,960
untrusted HTML should be sanitized this

785
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,340
is good we finished this

786
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,179
anything I'm gonna close this out

787
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,320
this fix it this fix is live

788
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,658
in the 5.0 directory

789
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,940
here's a summary of what we did summary

790
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,419
is number one you you cannot use allow

791
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,500
lists when the input type

792
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,080
is HTML

793
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,940
you need to sanitize HTML input with

794
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,000
like Dom purify or similar

795
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,840
change is done and live and makes total

796
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,159
sense

797
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,799
I'm closing this out

798
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,320
there you go stop the craziness elar I

799
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,260
love elar but he's like

800
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,120
elar and I are opposites elar likes to

801
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,099
likes to debate everything until he's

802
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,139
personally satisfied and I'm and I'm

803
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,639
like I want to move things forward when

804
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,440
experts get good sense and I love you

805
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,359
Laura he's one of the one of the best we

806
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,219
got so

807
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,440
I hope that our con our constant like

808
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,899
different perspective is helpful all

809
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,820
right so we don't have a lot of PR's we

810
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,480
have issues let's I'm gonna do one more

811
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,760
one more asvs issue and I'll call it

812
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,280
there's no item to check zip slip

813
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,760
related vulnerabilities you're right

814
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,099
actually it's covered in the path

815
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,240
traversal points

816
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:57,839
zip slip is when you unzip into a

817
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,280
directory with past with with files that

818
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,980
have like path traversal attacks in them

819
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,839
so you think you're unzipping in one

820
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,240
folder but it actually breaks out into

821
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,540
other

822
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,839
foreign

823
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,099
that zip slip

824
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,280
should somehow be mentioned

825
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,140
this is not like path a traversal

826
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,599
due to

827
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,980
Dev mistake per se it's a problem with

828
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,260
updating libraries

829
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,180
so let me make sure that's true let's go

830
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,800
look for let me go look for a zip slip

831
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,119
reference

832
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,440
I want to read a little bit about it

833
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,180
before I get to yes Nick's got some good

834
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,640
stuff on this so what's the fix though

835
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,079
are you vulnerable

836
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,940
if you're using a library as the

837
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,339
vulnerability or the project contains

838
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,440
vulnerable code which extracts files

839
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,960
from an archive without necessary

840
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,880
directory traversal validation

841
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,800
okay I'm gonna grab this so

842
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,000
foreign

843
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,380
somehow should somehow be mentioned

844
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,320
there's no this isn't Okay so

845
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,960
two two things

846
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,820
can go wrong

847
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,980
a library

848
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,859
may be totally vulnerable

849
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,460
and the developer may not be

850
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,380
checking

851
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,700
for this path

852
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,780
for example I typically unzip uploaded

853
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:56,160
files into a staging directory with

854
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,598
um OS level limits

855
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,740
so so I'm just a staging directory

856
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,900
that's I usually do at the OS level and

857
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,240
I have to unzip stuff which I which I

858
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,800
never want to do by the way it's a bad

859
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
thing so I'm just going to jump in add a

860
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,240
comment here and push this a little bit

861
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,380
further

862
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,160
and little by little the sausage is made

863
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,920
folks it's RSA for me I gotta catch a

864
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,900
flight this morning so there's there's

865
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,579
me condensing

866
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,640
my two hours of uh about two hours of

867
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,640
time to show you the three main projects

868
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,880
that I work on right I work on the asvs

869
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,740
standard that's most of my effort I work

870
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,079
on the cheat sheet series and I work on

871
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,940
the proactive controls these projects

872
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,920
are all defensive in nature hello

873
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,839
Breakers this is defensive in nature

874
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,540
they're meant for meant to help

875
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,220
developers write more secure code which

876
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,500
is my personal life mission I love a

877
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,020
wasp a lot of my OAS volunteerism is

878
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,359
giving talks and actually working on

879
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,980
projects I try to keep out of other

880
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,240
other business

881
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,820
that's it for me do I have do I have a

882
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,119
moderator still you do I'm gonna call it

883
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,859
I think that's a good summary of what

884
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,720
I'm up to I'm showing how the sausage is

885
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,119
made I'm pointing to get every pose in

886
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,520
case you'd like to add a comment hey hey

887
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,380

here thanks for caring about application

889
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,700
security I'm gonna go catch a flight and

890
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,099
get get myself to the East Coast

891
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,760
go forth and write secure code and thank

892
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,740
you again for caring about oh Washburn

893
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,480
