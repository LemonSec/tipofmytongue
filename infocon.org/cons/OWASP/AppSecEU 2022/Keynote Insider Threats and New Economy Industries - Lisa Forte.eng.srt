version of global appsec we're doing to

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,440
the coffee pandemy I'm looking forward

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,720
to the next in-person one and the end of

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,580
the year in San Francisco but now we go

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,760
on the virtual one and welcome to you

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,840

I misspelled and happy to announce the

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,000
first opening keynote speaker Lisa 14 14

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,820
I think uh it's a cyber security expert

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,739
and who doesn't know she started her

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,559
career in securing or trying to secure

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,260
uh stock pirates from taking ships in

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,140
the club Somalia she has been in the UK

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,660
counter-terrorism intelligence before

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
moving into the UK cyber crime units she

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,120
founded her own company Red Gold cyber

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,899
security in 2017. Lisa is a professional

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,600
speaker trainer entrepreneur a

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,820
documentary personality and vlogger I

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,040
think I could go on for take all the

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,080
hour of uh of the space for announcing

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,500
here she has uh it's a she's an expert

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,020
in Risk Management Insider threats and

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,400
social engineering

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,580
uh she has founded

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,460
um sorry she's founded a cyber for good

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,759
movement called cyber volunteers 19

32
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,680
organization provides pro bono help and

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,100
advice to help them protect Hospital

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,840
hospitals around Europe from cyber Tech

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,939
during the pandemic she also founded

36
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,979
respect and security and I think that's

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,540
on our heart for everybody a

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,340
volunteering organization

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,439
helping to stem out ahead and harassment

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,540
in our industry so I think that's a big

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,460
thing what she has done as well

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,579
uh with no fur video Welcome to this

43
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,360
conference and here you go Lisa Forte

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
the stage is yours

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,140
thank you very much I just share my

46
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,680
screen

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,939
hello everyone

48
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,520
um welcome I'm Lisa Forte um that's

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,619
quite an introduction that he gave me um

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm a cyber security professional

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,620
um and I specialize in training

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,500
um designing sort of programs and risk

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,819
management programs and then running

54
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,739
cyber crisis exercises for companies

55
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,599
around the world

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,000
um and I'm really fascinated generally

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,099
by risk and how we manage risk at

58
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,940
different levels both human technical

59
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,620
um and and how we sort of manage that

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,260
and that's very much reflected in my

61
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,599
personal life so if any of you

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,360
um happen to follow me online in on any

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,340
of the platforms you'll notice that I'm

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,560
a climber mccaver

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,819
um and I explore abandoned Minds for fun

66
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,099
um and all of that involves the

67
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,440
management of risk in difficult

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,540
environments potentially constantly

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
changing environments and so all of that

70
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,200
plays into my sort of general interest

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,080
in this area and how we manage risk

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,180
and the talk I'm going to give today

73
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,300
is how we manage risk from the inside we

74
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,640
talk a lot in security about how we

75
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,940
manage risk from protecting against

76
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,739
nefarious actors who are outside of our

77
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,959
organization how we stop them attacking

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,360
our organization and the assets that we

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,060
have but we also have to be mindful that

80
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,860
sometimes that threat can come from the

81
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,659
inside especially when we're dealing

82
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,860
with

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,379
things like developers when we're

84
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,180
dealing with IP when we're dealing with

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,640
any sort of r d or commercially

86
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,140
sensitive information

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,300
this can be really really attractive to

88
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,340
Insider threats

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,819
so I'm going to start by asking who are

90
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,440
insiders because I think this is a

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,500
concept that's largely misunderstood

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,140
um most of us would say an Insider was

93
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,700
an employee

94
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,920
and that is correct but often what we

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,099
forget is insiders can also be

96
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,000
contractors who work in our business

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,819
they can be board members they could be

98
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,580
suppliers who maybe have a lot of access

99
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,159
into the company and into the business

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
they could be interns or volunteers as

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
well who work again inside the business

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,720
an Insider is just somebody who has been

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,540
given authorized access to the things

104
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,779
that the company does that's all it is

105
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,840
and they can actually pose a really

106
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,280
substantial risk to the business

107
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,520
potentially because they have not only

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,940
been given the access legitimately to

109
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,880
for example uh source code for something

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,440
or

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,060
um you know intellectual property or a

112
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,860
chemical formula for a drug or whatever

113
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,780
is the business does

114
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,880
not only have they been given legitimate

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
access to some of those assets which in

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,699
itself delivers a bit of risk

117
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,500
they've also got the knowledge of the

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,720
business they've often got

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
a knowledge of how the business Works

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,940
what security is in place who's

121
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,979
responsible for

122
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,900
um delivering that security or enforcing

123
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,000
that security

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
there's been loads of cases of fraud for

125
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,660
instance inside large organizations

126
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,720
where they know how the audits are done

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,060
so they know how to avoid being detected

128
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,580
by those audits so they can pose a

129
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,560
really really big challenge both from

130
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,900
the perspective that you've got the the

131
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,419
access that to be honest a lot of

132
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,639
attackers would dream of having

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
and then you combine that with the

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,100
knowledge potentially to avoid or

135
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,320
obfuscate what you're doing and avoid

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,780
detection and those two things combined

137
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,500
make it a very difficult threat to

138
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,020
manage and to

139
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,600
um sort of mitigate I suppose

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,340
now another thing that always comes my

141
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,139
way in when I talk about Insider threats

142
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,240
is people say to me what is an Insider

143
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,979
threat who are they what do they look

144
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,139
like are they men are they women how old

145
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,539
are they what's the sort of profile

146
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,699
and if you look at the data from U.S

147
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,120
cert there is no one single demographic

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,460
profile of an Insider threat we have

149
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,479
seen every possible gender age race

150
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,880
religion everything

151
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,699
um becoming Insider threat so there's no

152
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,100
sort of one profile of person it's not

153
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,380
more likely to be an older person or a

154
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,539
younger person

155
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,639
it very much depends on job role

156
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,319
and I'll come on to that in a moment

157
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,819
when I talk about the different types of

158
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,280
attacks that we see from Insiders

159
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,500
so the first thing I want to tackle is

160
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,419
the difference between

161
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,419
an unintentional Insider and an

162
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,759
intentional Insider and from an

163
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,139
unintentional perspective we're talking

164
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,060
about people who maybe make a mistake

165
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,860
who click on that link in a phishing

166
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,500
email or who are maybe negligent in

167
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,960
something that they do or they send

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,759
something to the wrong person or they're

169
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,680
reckless in what they do

170
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,740
in all of those situations they don't

171
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,380
intend to cause harm to the organization

172
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,300
they don't intend to steal something

173
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,240
they don't intend to commit fraud

174
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,479
it's an accident a mistake

175
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,440
I actually don't like calling people

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,940
insiders who have made mistakes inside

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,440
of threats because I sort of feel that

178
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
it puts a really horrible

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,759
um sort of title on someone who's

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
essentially made a mistake which is

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,960
something we all do on an almost daily

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,639
basis or something I do on an almost

183
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,500
daily basis anyway

184
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,479
however these people are unintentional

185
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,099
they are just going about their daily

186
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,020
business trying to do their job and

187
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,720
something that they do causes uh the

188
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,060
manifestation of a risk

189
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,800
we're not going to talk about those

190
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,840
kinds of people in this talk we're

191
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,400
talking about the other type which is

192
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,699
intentional insiders so these are people

193
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,220
who within the organization whether

194
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,380
they're a contractor an employee a board

195
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,819
member whoever it is

196
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,300
they intend to do the thing they do so

197
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,840
this could be intentionally taking

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,780
um sensitive information this could be

199
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,880
intentionally planting a logic bomb or

200
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,979
creating a back door

201
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,039
all of these things are done with intent

202
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,919
and that that's the topic of of this

203
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,060
talk today

204
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,880
now people often also use the phrase

205
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,340
malicious Insider which is also really

206
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,800
misleading because malice is one

207
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,720
motivation for doing these things but

208
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,840
it's not the only motivation

209
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,280
intentional insiders intended to do what

210
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,500
they do but they don't necessarily do it

211
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,139
because of malice sometimes they do it

212
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,640
because they're in a really difficult

213
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,860
financial position and this is a way to

214
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,899
make quick money to pay for a health

215
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,020
bill or to to do something like that so

216
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,159
they're not Melissa they're not being

217
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,099
malicious necessarily they are doing it

218
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,459
for a different reason so we see money

219
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,620
being a motivator fear blackmail

220
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
sometimes

221
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,060
sometimes revenge and Malice there's a

222
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,019
whole spectrum of reasons why people do

223
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,459
these things

224
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,320
um so don't just reduce it down to

225
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,740
malice

226
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,360
so there are three types of intentional

227
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,519
Insider attacks that we see we have

228
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,100
theft which could be

229
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,459
um usually sort of this the the

230
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,680
um the theft of intellectual property or

231
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,260
research and development or things like

232
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,779
that so you'll usually see it

233
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,620
um in roles where you have for example

234
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,600
scientists engineers

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,420
um developers anyone who's doing

236
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,820
something that's creating something I

237
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,440
suppose you could say within the

238
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,440
business those are the rules that are

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
the most at risk for theft because if

240
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
you think about it let's just use an

241
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,399
example of a pharmaceutical company

242
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,140
if you've got a scientist who's working

243
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,380
on a drug a brand new drug he's got

244
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,959
access to really sensitive information

245
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,019
the HR person probably wouldn't have

246
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,760
access to the formulas for that drug

247
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,500
that they're working on

248
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,720
so they have less opportunity to commit

249
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
theft than than the scientist does in

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,140
that situation

251
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,320
so that's theft we also have sabotage

252
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,140
this is usually committed by techies

253
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,260
unfortunately by our kind of group of

254
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,480
individuals so it's usually techies

255
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,459
Security Professionals people like that

256
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,120
privileged users or some description

257
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,620
um just purely because everything we do

258
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,779
is is digital so they have the

259
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,640
opportunity to sabotage stuff delete

260
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,140
accounts

261
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,120
um interfere with code stuff like that

262
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,580
so sabotage is usually done by by

263
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,080
techies

264
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,120
and finally we have fraud

265
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,920
um and this is usually committed by

266
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
lower level employees people who work in

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,540
sort of data entry roles predominantly

268
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,480
who can change details on bank accounts

269
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,019
or insurance policies in order to

270
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,940
um financially enrich themselves I

271
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,040
suppose

272
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,579
foreign

273
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,500
so the next argument that people put

274
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,019
forward and another myth I suppose that

275
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,640
I'd like to dismiss

276
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,640
is that people who do these things are

277
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,940
what we'd say in the UK bad apples or

278
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,060
inherently evil bad people

279
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,480
and I hate this argument because firstly

280
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,700
I think it's rather naive and I think

281
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,040
it's also an argument that can really

282
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
put your organization at risk

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,680
let's take an example let's imagine for

284
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,079
a moment that your life is taking a turn

285
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,160
for the worse

286
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,740
your partner has left you

287
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,899
you're going through a divorce you're

288
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,480
very very stressed you're fighting a

289
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,579
custody battle

290
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,700
um let's say money's really tight the

291
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,440
you know your bills are adding up you've

292
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,540
got this financial pressure you've just

293
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,279
found out that your mum is really really

294
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,980
ill and you know you need some money to

295
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,260
help with her care you can't even really

296
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,060
afford to run your car at the moment

297
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,000
you're in a really difficult situation

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,640
and at work your manager is just not a

299
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,200
nice person they're really difficult

300
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
they're making your life hell

301
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,480
um then they're putting up all these

302
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,760
barriers to your job you thought you

303
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,019
were going to get this promotion but

304
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,760
that gets given to somebody else who's

305
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,720
nowhere near as experienced as you

306
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,760
if you imagine being in that situation

307
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,459
you're probably pretty close to Breaking

308
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,560
Point you're probably feeling pretty

309
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,779
isolated you're probably feeling pretty

310
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,100
desperate you're probably feeling really

311
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,180
disenfranchised with your life and with

312
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,519
the things that are happening

313
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,320
and let's imagine that a foreign

314
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
competitor to your to your employer

315
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,200
contacts you and says well here's 10 000

316
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,779
Euros as a golden hello

317
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,360
come and take a job with us just bring

318
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
along some of the code you've been

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,660
working on bring along that report

320
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,700
you've been working on and we'll give

321
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,620
you this money

322
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,779
all of a sudden when you're in that

323
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,519
desperate situation and things are

324
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,260
really really bad for you

325
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,139
that looks attractive that looks like a

326
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,000
good option that looks like a life vest

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,180
to get you through this difficult time

328
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,700
and this is the problem we reduce it

329
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
down to these people are evil but more

330
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,079
often than not and in almost every case

331
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,660
I've looked at the people who do these

332
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,920
things have been in a difficult

333
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
situation

334
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,060
and it's just sort of snowboard to the

335
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,420
point where eventually they do this

336
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,600
so this has become such a big problem

337
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,480
um people being contacted online usually

338
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,880
on LinkedIn but not just on LinkedIn

339
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,519
and encouraged to give information over

340
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,920
about what they're working on or share

341
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
things they shouldn't share and it's

342
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,519
become such a big problem that in the UK

343
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,360
MI5 one of our intelligence agencies uh

344
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,040
worked with the center for protection of

345
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,320
national infrastructure to develop an

346
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
app which you can download from the app

347
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,940
store which is all about educating

348
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,600
people how to spot suspicious profiles

349
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,660
online how to to to make sure you're not

350
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,000
handing over confidential information

351
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
MI5 came over a hundred thousand Brits

352
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,700
have actually been targeted

353
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,440
um in order to get confidential

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,820
information on what their company is

355
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,899
working on

356
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,480
and fake profiles are so easy to make

357
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,700
online you can quite easily make

358
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
something super convincing that you look

359
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,740
like a recruiter or an HR professional

360
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,899
or whoever it is

361
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,540
and you can contact people and try and

362
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,399
get information about their business and

363
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,680
what they're working on and what the

364
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,820
sort of projects are that they're

365
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,320
working on

366
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,920
for example in the first quarter of 2020

367
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,399
Facebook claimed that they took down 4.5

368
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,680
billion profiles just in the first

369
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,440
quarter that were fake in that same time

370
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,240
frame LinkedIn claimed they took down

371
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,339
7.3 million

372
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,860
Twitter estimate that between five to

373
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,199
fifteen percent of all of their accounts

374
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,940
are fake

375
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,639
so this is a really big problem and this

376
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,860
is a problem that as a society we're

377
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,660
going to have to really look at tackling

378
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,940
because some of these attacks can be

379
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,040
really convincing and I'm going to tell

380
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,380
you an example of how some of these

381
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,199
things could manifest

382
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,699
so

383
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,820
this gentleman will call him Rob is a

384
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,320
scientist let's say

385
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,899
he works in this company

386
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,699
he's a really good scientist he's been

387
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,079
going for a bit of a difficult time he's

388
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,500
been having a divorce he's you know it's

389
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,620
in the pandemic he's he's working hard

390
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,839
and he's a bit lonely like a lot of

391
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,300
people got during the pandemic and one

392
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,060
day he posts on LinkedIn and someone

393
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,699
comments on his post

394
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,399
and this person is a woman and she asks

395
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,360
a question that says something about the

396
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,459
nature of his post

397
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,500
so he's really intrigued and he replies

398
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,839
back to her and he decides to send her a

399
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,300
direct message to explain further what

400
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,220
he was meaning

401
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,860
so he writes historic message to her and

402
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,019
they started back and forth

403
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,820
they start talking about science it

404
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,100
turns out she's a scientist as well for

405
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,420
a different company

406
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,519
they start discussing all sorts of

407
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,620
things and the relationship turns a bit

408
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,560
more romantic let's say we become really

409
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,120
close friends a little bit romantic

410
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,459
relationship going on

411
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,920
and she starts asking lots and lots of

412
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,380
questions about his job he's working on

413
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,060
a very very sensitive project at the

414
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,940
moment he works for a big company in a

415
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,160
lab and she's asking lots of questions

416
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,779
about what he does and he's really

417
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,180
flattered so he's sending her lots of

418
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,620
information he's telling her lots of

419
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,420
stuff that he's working on

420
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,000
she wants to see what he's doing and

421
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,100
wants to discuss the science behind some

422
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,720
of those things

423
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
and obviously he's really flattered by

424
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,440
this whole process

425
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,680
so the relationship progresses and

426
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,199
as covid was locked down she's saying to

427
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,540
him regularly you know oh I've taken up

428
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,060
dancing and I'm getting really good at

429
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,860
him I want to post some videos and

430
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,139
create a YouTube channel would you mind

431
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,540
reviewing some of my dancing videos

432
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,699
so he's pretty flattered she's a

433
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,579
beautiful woman a beautiful Bulgarian

434
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,559
scientist oh sorry

435
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,299
um and

436
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,000
he says okay yeah sure so she sends him

437
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,220
some videos and she he watches them and

438
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,260
you know he sort of replies with the

439
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,959
expected responses that you just you'd

440
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,699
have thought he would

441
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,160
and then one day he's at work in the

442
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,480
office

443
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,640
and she says to him oh you know I'm

444
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,220
about to upload this new video

445
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,260
um would you mind if you just quickly

446
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,640
reviewed it

447
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,980
yeah sure send it to me

448
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,020
so she sends it to him it arrives on his

449
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,220
phone

450
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,059
he tries to click on it doesn't open

451
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,160
sensor response saying try to open it on

452
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,559
my phone won't open

453
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,200
she says oh no no that's because it

454
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,240
won't open on a phone it it just doesn't

455
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,860
like the operating system you have to

456
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,799
open it on a Windows device

457
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,860
okay so knowing that he shouldn't do

458
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,440
this he forwards the email from his

459
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,200
personal email to his work account

460
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
he goes into the open plan office goes

461
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
into the email opens the email

462
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
clicks on the video

463
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,980
still doesn't play

464
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,600
replies to her again and says look it's

465
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,919
still not playing I don't I don't know

466
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,539
why it's broken but it's broken I'm

467
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:22,919
sorry

468
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,900
so she replies oh yeah I had that

469
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,160
problem too

470
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,100
turns out that on the newer laptops and

471
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,660
the newer Windows devices it just won't

472
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,820
play I don't suppose you have like a

473
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,100
really old device a really old laptop a

474
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,539
really old computer or some description

475
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,220
it's running some sort of really old

476
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,900
programs

477
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,340
um I think some of the new software

478
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,039
interferes with the video

479
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,080
so things like eight there's only one

480
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,299
place in this organization where we have

481
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,140
really old devices and that's in the lab

482
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,440
so they're running really old software

483
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,960
for reasons that they need to to run

484
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
that software

485
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
so into the lab he goes

486
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,240
and he's got the file that he's

487
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,400
downloaded onto USB stick goes into the

488
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,260
lab plugs it into one of the lab

489
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,080
computers which he knows he shouldn't do

490
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,620
goes to open the video

491
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,900
still doesn't open

492
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,240
so at this point he's getting frustrated

493
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
and he said look I'm really sorry

494
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,100
um you know I've tried to open it I've

495
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,380
done it in the lab where we're running

496
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,140
sort of really old window software

497
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,120
and it's still not opening

498
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,679
um I'm sure it'll be great just post it

499
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,840
on YouTube I'll watch it later

500
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
and it turned out that the video was a

501
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
little bit less MP4 and a little bit

502
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,480
more malware

503
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,299
and thankfully the company discovered

504
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,240
this and no damage was done

505
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
but this person had managed to convince

506
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
him to break security rule after

507
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,320
security rule after security Rule and he

508
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,559
intentionally knowingly did all of those

509
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,020
things because he met this person and he

510
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,000
thought he was reviewing a video that

511
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
she was

512
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,840
wanting to Post online

513
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,179
so insiders are valuable I mean if you

514
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,039
think about what I just told you that

515
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,900
example

516
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,179
it's very common that they'll get you

517
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,820
talking about your work and you'll and

518
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,260
you'll be quite happy to do so because

519
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,539
you're relatively flattered that someone

520
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,900
is that interested in what you do

521
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,000
um they'll ask for proof of things that

522
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,799
you're working on documents files things

523
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,360
like that

524
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,100
um we've seen people who have actually

525
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,620
managed to get confidential reports

526
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,220
screenshotted and sent them as well

527
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,600
um and I think there was a social

528
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,340
engineering side of it which I won't go

529
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,860
into which is the people who are

530
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,020
creating these fake profiles

531
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,260
contacting you are under a pretext

532
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,820
and getting you to hand over information

533
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,039
or to do something

534
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,140
but you have to also see that from The

535
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,000
Insider perspective these people are

536
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,360
these insiders are breaking security

537
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,260
rules passing information they shouldn't

538
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,480
being sort of I guess lured into the

539
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,100
promise of

540
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,400
Financial enrichment or or whatever it

541
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,720
is so insiders are incredibly valuable

542
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,480
now in security we love a kill chain

543
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,460
kill chains for everything every type of

544
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,160
attack let's map it out like this so

545
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,020
typically

546
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,840
um the way we kind of see this work

547
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,960
is that whoever it is whether it's a

548
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,480
nefarious actor like an attacker whether

549
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,340
it's a competitor whether it's a foreign

550
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,179
State whoever the actor is behind the

551
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,340
the plan to get the information

552
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,140
they'll obviously do some reconnaissance

553
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,299
on the business

554
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,940
maybe they'll have targeted specific

555
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,220
businesses especially for theft specific

556
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,320
businesses that

557
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,940
um are developing really interesting

558
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,720
software or developing sort of uh really

559
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,220
interesting interesting engineering

560
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,500
projects or the vaccine for example

561
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,600
during covid

562
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,419
there'll be a first Contact so it will

563
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,100
usually be something pretty innocuous

564
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,740
it'll be something a bit

565
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,580
um

566
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,299
usually quite friendly nothing massively

567
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,159
um to raise any alarm Bells

568
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,500
over time they will build some rapport

569
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,900
with you to make you think that they are

570
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,539
a recruiter or whoever the pretense is

571
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,000
that they are they're coming to you from

572
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,159
then they'll usually test that Rapport

573
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,960
so they'll ask you for something really

574
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,659
little to just see whether you'll do the

575
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,720
thing that they're asking you to do

576
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,880
then they'll do the attacks or the

577
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
execution of the orders what they

578
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,780
actually want to achieve which from this

579
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,280
situation is usually to steal

580
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,960
information

581
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,700
um the other Insider attacks are a

582
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
little bit more personal

583
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,880
um and we'll come on to those in a

584
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,100
moment but from a theft perspective

585
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,440
usually if you're looking at sort of

586
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,500
corporate or industrial Espionage or

587
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,799
you're looking at state-based Espionage

588
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,740
um this is easy to steal information

589
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,720
sometimes it's to sabotage the company

590
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
as well but that's usually pretty noisy

591
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,080
so it's it's more about acquiring source

592
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,220
code or acquiring chemical formulas or

593
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,600
whatever it is

594
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,400
and then they'll usually extract from

595
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,440
the engagement pretty swiftly and this

596
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,419
will usually be that the profiles that

597
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,039
they had online get deleted really

598
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,600
quickly

599
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,020
um sometimes they'll have a whole story

600
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,299
of why they need to sort of disappear

601
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,780
and that's usually done so that they can

602
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,400
re-enter again and contact you again

603
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,280
later on if they need to and sometimes

604
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,799
they do genuinely offer people jobs give

605
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,200
them money to steal the information and

606
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
then those jobs do in fact exist and

607
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,820
people go on and and do those jobs so

608
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,880
it's not always that it's it's all a lie

609
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,340
but it's definitely got some intent

610
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,600
behind it that perhaps you didn't

611
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
realize

612
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,559
so some of the things that we see as

613
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,200
like the approaches or the reasons why

614
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,120
people might approach you especially for

615
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,419
theft specifically to get you to take

616
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,640
something from your company that you

617
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,900
shouldn't take and give it to somebody

618
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,820
who shouldn't have it for whatever

619
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,200
reason

620
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,659
so we often see this from recruitment is

621
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,220
a big one

622
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,400
in fact in the MI5 campaign they talk a

623
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,039
lot about recruiters people claiming to

624
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,080
be recruitment Consultants

625
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,780
or HR people in a company

626
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,840
who are recruiting you

627
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,700
I have actually had some conference

628
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,039
invites where people have invited me to

629
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,280
speak at events and let's just say that

630
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,320
some of the invites have been incredibly

631
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,480
suspicious I've had a few friends who've

632
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,580
also had this happen to them where

633
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,080
they've wanted information on things

634
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,539
that you just suddenly think this is a

635
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,220
bit weird I'm not sure this is a real

636
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,919
conference at all

637
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,480
um we can we've also seen it from

638
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,039
romance and friendship like in the

639
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
example I gave

640
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,720
um that woman starting a romantic

641
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,299
relationship also you know friendship as

642
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,640
well can also work

643
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,539
business opportunities consultancy work

644
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,039
investment in your company or your new

645
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,320
business Promises of business

646
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,020
Partnerships and all of this sort of

647
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,740
thing

648
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,679
um is is really really common as reasons

649
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,500
that they might contact you in order to

650
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,100
to get you to do something

651
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,520
so we've talked a little bit about how

652
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,440
this can be done

653
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,480
from the perspective of an outsider

654
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,700
manipulating you on some level to do it

655
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,059
but this can also happen from people

656
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,279
themselves in their own organizations

657
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,919
and there's two kind of examples that I

658
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,720
want to give you from a sort of techy

659
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,460
space I suppose

660
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,100
so start with theft

661
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,840
so in this case

662
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,520
um the person in question was an

663
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,400
engineer they worked at a sort of visual

664
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,000
simulation software company

665
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,720
and they resigned and at their exit

666
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,240
interview they were asked have you

667
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,059
returned all of the devices have you

668
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,039
returned you know do you have any copies

669
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,520
of any of the code blah blah blah

670
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,240
and

671
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,980
um they said they sort of lied at this

672
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,360
exit interview and they said yeah I've

673
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,700
returned absolutely everything there's

674
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,220
nothing I have at all

675
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,059
so they leave and that's all sort of

676
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,820
tied up from the company's perspective

677
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,900
and they decide that they're going to

678
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,940
become sort of self-employed a

679
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,520
consultant and it turns out that

680
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,240
actually they had stolen the source code

681
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
for this new product

682
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,179
they then over the next year actually

683
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,600
spent time coercing people who they'd

684
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,520
previously worked with at this company

685
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,700
to give them more information and more

686
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,360
um

687
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,039
sort of

688
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,980
interesting pieces of of r d I suppose

689
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,380
you could say related to this

690
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,000
so that happened over the course of

691
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,279
probably just under a year

692
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,820
and then they accepted a job for another

693
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,440
company so they decided to leave the

694
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,659
consultancy space they accepted this job

695
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,520
where they went to work for this other

696
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,980
company that was a competitor of the

697
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,360
company that they'd stolen the source

698
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,500
code of

699
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,039
so they go and work for this company and

700
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,919
obviously

701
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,400
develop this stolen this stolen code

702
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,740
into another product and they go to this

703
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,260
conference and they this company that

704
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,760
they're now working for they do this big

705
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,740
launch of this product

706
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,240
and it just so happened that

707
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,460
representatives of his previous employer

708
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,580
were at the same event and saw that the

709
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,279
product that they were launching was a

710
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,659
hundred percent

711
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,720
a stone product from their company put

712
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,940
two and two together and went oh my God

713
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,760
they've stolen all this stuff

714
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,659
so in this particular instance actually

715
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,940
the the company was really lucky because

716
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,500
they actually reported it to the

717
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,620
authorities and the they actually found

718
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,900
evidence that this individual had stolen

719
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,059
this source code and then they'd taken

720
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,820
that and given it to this competitor

721
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,200
developed this product launched it the

722
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,380
whole sort of chain was proven

723
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,419
um and they got I think it was ten

724
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,039
thousand dollar fine and I think they

725
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,200
got two years in jail as a result of it

726
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
this individual so in that particular

727
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,279
case

728
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,380
in some ways they were too noisy about

729
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,900
it maybe with the launch I don't know

730
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,520
um but they got caught

731
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,760
and this individual actually was put in

732
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
prison for it

733
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,080
so it is a crime we have to be aware

734
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,820
that that is a crime

735
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,279
um and sometimes companies do actually

736
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,620
have the ability to prove that someone

737
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,840
has stolen these things

738
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,659
so that's theft that's stealing of

739
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,960
something

740
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,679
in some ways sabotage is

741
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,419
harder to understand

742
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,059
um and this often happens because most

743
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,279
of the situations were sabotage happen

744
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,220
because someone is angry with their

745
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,299
employer they're disgruntled they are

746
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,080
um usually either planning on leaving or

747
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,899
actually handed in their notice

748
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,779
and they want revenge sabotage comes

749
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:32,159
from a feeling of anger a feeling of

750
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,559
sort of Beyond discontent really

751
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,220
disgruntlement perhaps and the need to

752
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,340
sort of exact revenge on this employer

753
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,380
that you think has done something bad to

754
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,940
you

755
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,740
so in this case

756
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,440
um there was a software developer and

757
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,260
they actually were terminated from their

758
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,120
job for poor performance

759
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,779
and they they left the company and they

760
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,700
actually got a job

761
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,279
their next job with a subsidiary of that

762
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,899
same company which was a bit odd and

763
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,779
that was about a month later or so

764
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,960
but what happened was the company that

765
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,240
had fired this person

766
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,620
hadn't deactivated his accounts so he

767
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,539
managed over the course of a few months

768
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,120
to access I think it was something like

769
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
30 odd user accounts he got into

770
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,820
people's emails he managed to review and

771
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,640
change code that was being used within

772
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,679
the organization

773
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,140
um deleted like software

774
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,320
um modification notices uh created

775
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,059
accounts he actually deleted or removed

776
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,240
both the CEO and the cfo's accounts at

777
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,419
one point completely disabled them

778
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,580
um there was a assist admin in the

779
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,620
organization who

780
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,580
actually would log into her account and

781
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,500
see that someone had logged in an hour

782
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,380
ago and he was logging in and doing

783
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,720
stuff from the sysadmin account so he

784
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,760
had all this access and they hadn't

785
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,740
disabled any of it they hadn't

786
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,020
um changed anything and he was really

787
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,140
good at deleting logs hiding what he was

788
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,460
doing

789
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,620
um and sort of just generally being a

790
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,820
nuisance

791
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,620
and it wasn't until they actually

792
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,200
changed some employees around within the

793
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,480
company that they did a review of all

794
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,340
the accounts and this was a long time

795
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,679
afterwards

796
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,600
um that they realized what was happening

797
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,200
and this gentleman was sort of having I

798
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,080
suppose in English law terms going off

799
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,840
on a Frolic of his own and sort of doing

800
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,600
all these sorts of things so again he

801
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,640
was sort of interfering and and

802
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,220
sabotaging and in that case he didn't he

803
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,020
didn't do an awful lot of damage it was

804
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,279
more

805
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,500
being a nuisance really more than it was

806
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,039
causing huge damage but we have seen in

807
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,140
sabotage cases people planting logic

808
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,480
bombs we have seen people creating back

809
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,539
doors we have seen people creating

810
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,460
accounts and then selling them on the

811
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,580
dark web or defacing the company website

812
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,980
has happened a lot

813
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,880
um

814
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,799
so we've seen a lot of these things

815
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,480
happen and again like I said at the very

816
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,120
beginning because all our businesses are

817
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,179
run digitally now almost all the cases

818
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,419
involving sabotage are techies because

819
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,720
we are privileged account holders

820
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,580
we are pretty much the only people in

821
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,980
the business who could really do

822
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,480
a lot of damage when it comes to

823
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,039
sabotage

824
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,480
um and if you think about it from your

825
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,539
own roles if you wanted to sabotage the

826
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:40,919
organization there's a lot of ways you

827
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,179
could do it that would be hugely

828
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,500
damaging

829
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,559
so those are sort of a few more examples

830
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,360
I suppose

831
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,620
of

832
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,340
how insiders have as I said at the

833
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,640
beginning the access to the crucial

834
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,260
things so account modification codes IP

835
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,700
all of the sort of crucial systems

836
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,200
applications and assets that a company

837
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,860
might have insiders have access to those

838
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,659
legitimately they also have the

839
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,159
knowledge of how to hide things

840
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,159
especially techies especially people who

841
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,080
work in I.T security

842
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,600
you know how to hide your tracks

843
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,899
you know how to cover things up you may

844
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,760
even be the person responsible for

845
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,320
spotting these things

846
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,080
so you have an ability to cover Your

847
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,480
Tracks very easily which an outsider

848
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,059
doesn't have the same capability as an

849
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,159
Insider for doing that

850
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,860
so Insider threat

851
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,320
can be a huge huge problem and

852
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,140
specifically they are a massive problem

853
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,720
for any company that's working in sort

854
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,080
of a high r d space so things like

855
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,720
businesses in the new economy market so

856
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,600
anything to do with technology but also

857
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,120
sort of scientific based Industries as

858
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,059
well especially for theft really very

859
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:07,140
vulnerable to Insider attacks

860
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,418
so what do we do

861
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,260
well one of the kind of key things that

862
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,239
I've been working on recently is

863
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,918
developing

864
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,020
um an awareness of everybody into

865
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,000
creating Insider threat programs and

866
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,699
feeding into internet threat programs so

867
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,219
in the US they tend to be a little bit

868
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,280
more advanced on this concept than in

869
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
Europe and and the UK

870
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,820
um

871
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,219
but we should all have Insider threat

872
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,899
programs operating within our our

873
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,239
organization just like we do for all

874
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,639
other elements of security

875
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,040
and I argue that there's four elements

876
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,359
that need to go into that inside the

877
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,560
threat program

878
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,839
the first one is training

879
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,399
so

880
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,300
stripped back down recognize

881
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,580
potentially malicious profiles online

882
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,280
people who might be trying to contact

883
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,220
you because you are working in the absec

884
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,560
space you are an attractive Mark

885
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,780
potentially you're going to have access

886
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,040
to things that are interesting that are

887
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,220
valuable financially valuable

888
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,920
so because of that you have to be a

889
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,200
little bit more aware of what

890
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,359
potentially malicious profiles might be

891
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,140
like

892
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,420
so if you have an opportunity go and

893
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,839
download the cpni app on the App Store

894
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,060
free to download

895
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,500
um was created by MI5 and cpni go

896
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,720
download it and and just go through the

897
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,980
training program it's really quick

898
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,380
really easy gives you a bit of an idea

899
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,140
of what these profiles look like

900
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,359
um so training is really good to make

901
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,160
sure that we're aware

902
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,900
of what this sort of thing looked like

903
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,119
but also if you're having a conversation

904
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,740
with somebody online

905
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,680
and just just look at the way the

906
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,200
conversation is going and what I mean by

907
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,420
that is if you're having a conversation

908
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,740
with someone who's pretending to be a

909
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,800
friend or a recruiter or whoever they're

910
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,320
pretending to be and you don't know this

911
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,339
person

912
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,160
look at the conversation and think is

913
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,440
this normal does this look like a

914
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,000
conversation I would have with other

915
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,460
friends or other recruiters or other

916
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,839
business people

917
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,359
because the chances are

918
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,160
if they're trying to get information out

919
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,260
of you they are probably asking you

920
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,300
questions and you are probably doing all

921
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,320
the talking

922
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,119
and generally in a conversation it's

923
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,060
pretty balanced it's pretty 50 50. if it

924
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,400
doesn't look that way just allow that to

925
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,380
trigger some alarm bells in you

926
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,359
and then think about how you would

927
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,760
report these things if they happened or

928
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,680
you know if you spot somebody within

929
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,300
your organization who you think might be

930
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,619
doing something they ought not to be

931
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,320
doing how do you report that

932
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,560
so that's training support

933
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,359
um one of the things I talk about a lot

934
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,740
is that actually one of the best ways to

935
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,660
stop Insider threats happening within

936
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,820
your organization is for employees to

937
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,880
feel supported and to feel like they've

938
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,440
got someone to turn to if they've got

939
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,460
problems

940
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,400
so using the example of sabotage for

941
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,660
instance

942
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,660
as I said before we know sabotage

943
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,660
happens because somebody is angry they

944
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,760
are taking Revenge out against their

945
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,020
company

946
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,619
so if you have a situation where you can

947
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,240
detect that this person is really

948
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,700
unhappy in their role that maybe they're

949
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,740
going through financial troubles maybe

950
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,240
they're having a hard time personally

951
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,440
maybe they're having mental health

952
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,079
problems gambling issues or whatever it

953
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,640
is that's happening to them that's

954
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,859
affecting their life

955
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,140
um you can put in place

956
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,420
as organizations can put in place

957
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,280
Employee Assistance programs to help

958
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,359
them

959
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,579
to stop them from getting to the point

960
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:54,359
where they are angry or in financial

961
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,579
trouble and thinking about potentially

962
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,560
taking something and selling it to

963
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
somebody else

964
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,119
we have the ability to provide support

965
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,980
for our staff and employees to the

966
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,720
degree that actually they're not

967
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,060
vulnerable to being manipulated they're

968
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,560
not vulnerable to being approached and

969
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,599
offered money because we are there to

970
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,040
help them and support them if they need

971
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,520
it and that is a real real key point if

972
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,839
you're going to have an Insider threat

973
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,880
program that works it has to be based

974
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,560
off of that

975
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,020
we also need ability for people to

976
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,540
report stuff so we need to have an

977
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,000
ability to whistle but I mean on my on

978
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,180
my website red red hyphengo.com there is

979
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,700
a white paper research paper that I that

980
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,099
I did a few years ago

981
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,380
um free to download

982
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,660
um go and have a look at it it talks

983
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,380
about how reluctant we are to report

984
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,720
people who are doing something and in

985
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,880
this piece of research we looked at we

986
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,619
gave all of the participants

987
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,260
um a set of scenarios of things that

988
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,700
they saw somebody in their organization

989
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,320
doing and some of these things were

990
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
outrageously bad

991
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,440
and it turned out that in fact the only

992
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,020
people they were happy to go and report

993
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,940
and say this person's doing something

994
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,920
dodgy this person's doing something bad

995
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,960
the only category of people they were

996
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,900
happy to do that for were contractors

997
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,119
nobody else colleagues they didn't want

998
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,140
to report

999
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,300
if their boss was doing something bad

1000
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,480
they didn't want to report that either

1001
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,740
and it turned it was actually quite

1002
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,400
surprising that people felt I can't go

1003
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,440
and report on a colleague I can't go and

1004
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,900
report on a manager who's doing

1005
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,579
something they shouldn't be doing

1006
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,040
so you have to think about that as well

1007
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,980
how can we encourage people within our

1008
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,280
companies to say oh I don't think

1009
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,740
something's right with this person I'm a

1010
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,859
bit concerned about them or I saw them

1011
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:51,180
doing some this thing that they

1012
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,280
shouldn't be doing and how can we do

1013
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,619
that in a supportive way that doesn't

1014
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,020
penalize people but also doesn't create

1015
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,000
this culture of

1016
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,119
um oh you went and told on me so now I'm

1017
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,500
going to sort of

1018
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,260
um in you know sort of impede your

1019
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,780
progress within in the organization

1020
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,880
so reporting is another really important

1021
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,960
thing

1022
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,440
and then finally monitoring so we do

1023
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,960
need some monitoring on some of the key

1024
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,599
key job roles within our organization so

1025
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,099
as I said before going back to those

1026
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,339
three attacks theft going to be people

1027
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,760
who are developing software developing

1028
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,800
um scientists maybe who are developing

1029
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,680
chemicals or drugs or things like that

1030
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,900
Engineers who are working on projects

1031
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,460
the people who are going to steal stuff

1032
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,900
are going to have access to the

1033
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,480
stealable information right so we could

1034
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,880
monitor that group of people

1035
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,579
sabotage we know almost completely

1036
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,760
committed uh by Security Professionals

1037
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,060
techies developers so some monitoring on

1038
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,680
that group of individuals

1039
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,380
fraud which was the final attack we know

1040
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,440
low level data entry roles so we can put

1041
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,900
some monitoring on that group of people

1042
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,640
we don't need to monitor the entire

1043
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,859
organization

1044
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:10,020
aggressively that's not necessarily

1045
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,180
appropriate in fact

1046
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,400
um as most of us are in Europe in the EU

1047
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,280
um the European courts have been really

1048
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,900
really clear that any monitoring you do

1049
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,060
on your staff has to be proportionate

1050
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,460
and has to be necessary and has to be

1051
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,619
restrictive I had a company the other

1052
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,660
week who was talking to me about an

1053
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,099
Insider threat program they were trying

1054
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,780
to put in place and they were talking

1055
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,280
about their monitoring and they said to

1056
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,980
me is it okay if we can just turn on the

1057
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,520
webcams of the the laptops the personal

1058
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,460
laptops of our staff and I thought no

1059
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,220
you you can't you can't do that that's

1060
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,560
not that is not restrictive that's not

1061
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,900
that's not okay so we do need some

1062
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,760
monitoring but we have to make sure that

1063
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,839
that monitoring is reasonable

1064
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,560
it's as small as possible don't do more

1065
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,420
than you have to

1066
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,000
um making sure that whatever monitoring

1067
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,500
you put in place you can actually use

1068
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,200
because in a lot of situations you will

1069
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,079
collect logs on things and then you have

1070
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,000
no ability to review them so there's no

1071
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,820
point in collecting them

1072
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,040
um so making sure that you're doing you

1073
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,720
know a bit of monitoring but not too

1074
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,460
much and making sure that that's really

1075
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,099
just open and honest with your staff so

1076
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,200
making sure everyone is aware of what

1077
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,760
monitoring is on them

1078
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,060
and why I think is is kind of a key

1079
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,619
point

1080
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,020
so the final thought I kind of want to

1081
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,880
leave you with is

1082
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,220
I have this sort of general theory with

1083
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,079
Insider threats that someone who is

1084
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,839
Happy satisfied content enjoying life

1085
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,760
doesn't turn around and steal stuff from

1086
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,820
their employer doesn't turn around and

1087
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,400
sabotage their employer there's no need

1088
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,960
to commit fraud because you've got money

1089
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,180
you've got lots to lose you've got a

1090
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,560
nice life

1091
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,220
so the more we can think about creating

1092
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,560
a work environment that's that looks

1093
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,500
like that for our employees the more we

1094
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,900
reduce the threat and I tweeted the

1095
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,060
other day that if you're inside a threat

1096
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,700
program is just monitoring monitoring

1097
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,040
monitoring you've probably increased

1098
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,079
your risk of an Insider threat

1099
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,079
so it's really important that we send a

1100
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,599
message to all of our colleagues

1101
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,060
our staff that actually you're not alone

1102
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,220
if you have problems if you have

1103
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,200
troubles if you're going through a tough

1104
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,200
time if you hate your job within our

1105
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,079
within the organization we are open to

1106
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,000
having a discussion about how we improve

1107
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,859
that situation for you

1108
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,960
and then you're reducing your

1109
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,260
vulnerability to people being paid to

1110
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,359
hand over information you're reducing

1111
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,880
your vulnerability of people being so

1112
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,619
annoyed with your company that they want

1113
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,180
to sabotage it

1114
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,480
and I think that's the best way to

1115
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,980
reduce the threat

1116
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,220
so I hope you enjoyed the talk I think

1117
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,500
we've got a few minutes for questions

1118
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,900
hopefully from Martin

1119
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,000
um but before we tend to that I just

1120
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,760
want to quickly give a shout out to uh

1121
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,520
respection security which is a volunteer

1122
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,440
organization that I co-founded with a

1123
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,540
bunch of other people and I really

1124
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,099
recommend you go and check them out

1125
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,380
follow them participate in the

1126
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,640
discussion

1127
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,500
um it's a voluntary organization we

1128
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,740
created to try and Stamp Out hate and

1129
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,980
harassment in the sort of tech

1130
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,339
um security industry and there's loads

1131
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:42,720
of initiatives there that you can get

1132
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,520
involved with but it's all about trying

1133
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,640
to stop bullying and trolling and all of

1134
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,780
that sort of thing that goes on in our

1135
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,240
industry sadly so please please go and

1136
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,920
give them some support it's a really

1137
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,540
important message

1138
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,700
thank you waiting for Martin

1139
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,319
thank you so much Lisa really great

1140
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,740
presentation as expected and uh yes we

1141
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,140
have several questions well first one I

1142
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,359
want to ask how common are those Insider

1143
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,900
threat attacks

1144
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,800
Insider threats are

1145
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,440
they're not hugely common thankfully the

1146
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,420
problem with them is when they happen

1147
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,540
they are really really really serious so

1148
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,339
it's one of those things that they don't

1149
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:25,740
happen a lot necessarily

1150
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,839
but we've seen it with Tesla for example

1151
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,119
they had a really bad one not not too

1152
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,980
long ago we've seen it with lots of

1153
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,359
other companies that have had this sort

1154
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,960
of thing happen they are really usually

1155
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,880
really serious and actually really

1156
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,220
publicly embarrassing when you have to

1157
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,560
say yeah that was one of our developers

1158
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,660
that stole that sorry that's a really

1159
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,480
embarrassing thing for a company to say

1160
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,540
it's also uh types of companies that are

1161
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,940
more vulnerable to those attacks

1162
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,700
yeah I'd say probably

1163
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,319
um companies that operate in sort of new

1164
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,660
economy markets so tech companies would

1165
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,280
be really vulnerable because it's such a

1166
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,980
high r d space we're developing new

1167
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,660
stuff all the time and the other one

1168
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,160
that I've seen recently actually is the

1169
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,740
gaming space as well so people who are

1170
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,960
working in developing

1171
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,640
um sort of PlayStation games and things

1172
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,280
like that that's actually a really

1173
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,960
um aggressive Market where people are

1174
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,760
getting paid a lot of money to hand over

1175
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,980
things they're working on

1176
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,980
okay another question is uh as you

1177
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,200
mentioned uh for the threat or tampering

1178
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,240
was told the question is what is the

1179
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,160
share I think the speed of internal

1180
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,500
threats versus external threat when it

1181
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,079
comes to code tempering theft from what

1182
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,640
have you seen during your assessments

1183
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,619
for in a lot of these situations

1184
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:52,020
sometimes it can be quicker and easier

1185
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,960
to get in Via social engineering by

1186
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,400
talking to somebody who works in the

1187
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,720
company and getting them to hand over

1188
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,460
information

1189
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,900
um and again it comes back to that

1190
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,280
position so there was a gaming company

1191
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,560
recently I forget what the name of it

1192
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,140
was you had this situation and it turned

1193
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,839
out one of their developers was a pretty

1194
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,819
young person I think there's been a lot

1195
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,800
of talk in the gaming industry about how

1196
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,540
overworked people are who develop games

1197
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,400
um and this particular person was not at

1198
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,740
all satisfied with their job was hugely

1199
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,000
stressed

1200
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,099
um and I think they were paid 40 000

1201
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,339
Euros to hand over a little bit of

1202
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,140
information of what they were working on

1203
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,680
now this person I think was like 26 27

1204
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,599
they were really young

1205
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,240
um 40 000 Euros and a lot of money

1206
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,560
it's a lot of money if you think you're

1207
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,720
not going to get caught right so they

1208
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,940
did they handed it over and I think you

1209
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,760
see that's where the line kind of blurs

1210
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,859
it's not necessarily just only outside

1211
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:52,680
people inside people it kind of

1212
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,380
um the share of it can sort of yeah

1213
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,540
change but I think you know a lot of

1214
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,520
these things unfortunately they're going

1215
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,079
to benefit competitors it's not

1216
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,880
necessarily for organized criminals it's

1217
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,339
for people who compete with your company

1218
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:06,780
right

1219
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,060
oh yeah another question is so between

1220
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,760
the theft League sabotage or other types

1221
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,780
of text

1222
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,300
which one was the most popular in the

1223
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,220
past 12 months

1224
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,300
uh theft big time yeah and I think it's

1225
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,319
because

1226
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,240
um generally I I don't know if some of

1227
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,920
you might have heard of this uh they

1228
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,599
talk about the great resignation that's

1229
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,400
happening now globally right because of

1230
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,740
covid and everything that's happened

1231
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,240
um and because you've got loads of

1232
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,099
people moving jobs it's a perfect

1233
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,680
opportunity to take a few copies of some

1234
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,839
of the things you've been working on and

1235
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,119
go and sell them so I think theft is the

1236
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,640
biggest problem because

1237
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,260
um also people you know it's difficult

1238
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,720
with the cost of living issues the

1239
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,640
increase in gas prices the increase in

1240
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,980
in lots of our bills

1241
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,480
um people are struggling for money as

1242
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,040
well so if someone comes up and offers

1243
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,319
you 40 000 Euros

1244
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,819
starts to look a bit more attractive

1245
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,380
doesn't it

1246
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,420
the next second part of the same

1247
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,400
question is what are some of the

1248
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,280
forecasts for the next 12 to 24 months

1249
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,079
some of the forecasts and that's

1250
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,460
interesting

1251
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,800
um so I think one of the big problems

1252
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,300
we're going to have is this hybrid

1253
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,160
working I think hybrid working is great

1254
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,500
for a number of reasons like I work I

1255
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,240
work in a hybrid working environment my

1256
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,640
company employs hybrid working

1257
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,700
um but I do think the problem is you

1258
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,500
don't have the visibility as you did

1259
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,060
when they're in the office and the

1260
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,560
problem you have with that is that it

1261
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,520
does

1262
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,800
um allow people to take copies of things

1263
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,920
that you might not notice I had um a

1264
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,119
company the other day who was an

1265
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,220
investment bank and they had people

1266
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,319
working from home and they said there's

1267
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:46,859
no way they'd be able to steal any of

1268
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,140
these documents and send them out and I

1269
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,940
said to them but they're working from

1270
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,220
home so of course they can and they said

1271
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,020
no no it's fine they can't we monitor

1272
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,400
all of it they wouldn't be able to do it

1273
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,920
and I said well I can do it by doing

1274
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,740
this

1275
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,140
take a photo on my phone done and then

1276
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,140
they thought oh yeah they could do that

1277
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,760
couldn't they that would that would work

1278
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,680
we wouldn't notice that so I think

1279
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,119
that's one problem that we are going to

1280
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,220
see that hybrid working

1281
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,980
does give more opportunity to people

1282
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,780
being able to do things that they

1283
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,819
probably might not want to do in an

1284
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:22,140
office environment so I think we will

1285
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,819
see more theft

1286
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:25,980
um I do think that with sabotage again

1287
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,480
there's a lot of people who are going

1288
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,760
through tough times at the moment and I

1289
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,260
think as soon as you start putting all

1290
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,480
these different pressures on people

1291
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,960
food crises cost of living crises

1292
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,579
um all of this pressure that's going on

1293
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,319
different people I do think we might

1294
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,720
start to see people becoming more

1295
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,560
agitated and that might also go up

1296
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,800
yeah thanks though one more question

1297
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,260
um yes reporting can go the wrong way if

1298
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,359
people trust can report or colleagues

1299
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:56,640
they don't like or are competitors in

1300
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,619
the workplace how you afford that

1301
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,640
problem

1302
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,339
so I think you need Anonymous reporting

1303
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:03,900
to try and encourage people to report

1304
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,839
genuine bad behavior but as you say the

1305
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,180
other problem is well if I really hate

1306
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,220
my colleague I'm just going to put in a

1307
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,020
report to say that she's doing all these

1308
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,940
horrible things right

1309
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,440
um and that's not necessarily true and

1310
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,480
that comes down to then your security

1311
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,400
teams and your Insider threat teams

1312
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,619
being able to go through it and actually

1313
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,839
establish whether it's true or not

1314
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,599
um and that is it is complicated you see

1315
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,640
this happen with policing right there's

1316
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,859
it's the same sort of thing

1317
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,559
um and I think yeah so I think that the

1318
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,160
way you investigate reports has to be

1319
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,260
really fair I think it has to be

1320
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,079
thorough it has to be evidence-based and

1321
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,240
you have to sort of have those processes

1322
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,920
in place to ensure

1323
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,260
that if you do get people reporting on

1324
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,960
people they hate just for fun or

1325
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,059
whatever they're doing you have a

1326
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,520
process that they don't get disciplined

1327
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,559
um but it is a yeah it is a genuine

1328
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,240
concern and that's why sometimes I think

1329
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,480
we have to accept that there isn't one

1330
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,540
good solution it's just a choice of not

1331
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,619
very good Solutions

1332
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,540
I remember several years ago I was at a

1333
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,160
conference in the Netherlands and there

1334
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,099
was one guy he called himself he's not a

1335
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:20,040
security uh role he has a he's

1336
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,200
transparency uh you know transparency

1337
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,960
officer because he wants people to be

1338
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,119
able to work transparency and then very

1339
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,579
transparent way to report so it was

1340
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,680
Anonymous or by name and of course

1341
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,300
beginning when you could report

1342
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,099
everything on everybody

1343
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:36,839
and the whole following up was very

1344
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,359
transparent to the one who is Accused he

1345
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,220
said by making it very transparent you

1346
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,200
suddenly have a environment where it's

1347
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,780
not blaming but just asking like why are

1348
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,660
you well having two laptops carrying out

1349
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,339
it's just a very normal things like this

1350
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:51,900
normally don't ask but it was really

1351
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,960
interesting one and they were only

1352
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,180
hidden those who did something wrong I

1353
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,980
said not even on purpose but just have

1354
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,020
been tricked by uh this you know

1355
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,280
tricksters

1356
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,500
went on the videos and explained their

1357
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,839
case so I lost my job because I didn't

1358
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:09,180
saw those signs and because they were

1359
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,579
system spelled and not just goodbye we

1360
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:14,099
have to fire you but also help them to

1361
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:17,040
continue with them outside

1362
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,319
to be even so that I come up the video

1363
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,540
they do recording tell their style Story

1364
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,920
how they have been tricked I think

1365
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,079
that's very impressive yeah yeah and

1366
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,400
yeah and ultimately you can help them

1367
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,540
right if

1368
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,160
and get involved early enough you can

1369
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,599
help them before they've done something

1370
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,460
that they can't undo
