00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,560
in information communication systems he

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
had almost a decade of experience in

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,420
software development before he starts

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,840
being a full-time cyber security expert

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,380
since then he helped for eight years the

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,880
role of lead information security

Germany he has a passion for building

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,759
the right system in the right way

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,860
by providing defects and vulnerabilities

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,619
by from manifesting and finding them as

38
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,500
early as possible he particularly enjoys

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,560
doing and teaching threat modeling and

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,140
another area of interest of Louis is

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,939
getting the right requirements when they

42
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,560
are needed for which he is already

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,060
adopted asvs twice once for each of his

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,479
last employers welcome and please take

45
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,500

the session

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,840
if you could unmute yourself please and

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,360
you can that's a regular thing in online

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239
meetings happening all the time I'm very

50
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,739
sorry I thought I had unmuted before

51
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,959
sharing the screen so again thank you

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,120
very much for joining I'm Louis Cervin

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,099
I'm very excited to be here with you

54
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,660
today and I good luck to you to answer

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,640
the polls I made for the for the

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
presentation uh you can find them on the

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,060
Hoover app on the right hand side I have

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,940
I think three or four poles the idea is

59
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,000
to to see whether we can address this

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,440
and and the challenges that you're

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,620
facing if you're trying to adopt asbs or

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,400
for that matter any compliance topics so

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,860
let's get started

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,160
um ask questions I'll be happy to answer

65
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,379
them okay so

66
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,140
um let's get started

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,959
so probably you were at least some of

68
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,680
you in the presentation from um Josh uh

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,180
Crosman um just before my talk so I

70
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,860
suppose I don't have to give a very deep

71
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,959
introduction into what asbs is the

72
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,220
application security verification

73
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,800
standard but still I'm gonna spend a

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,599
little bit of time going through that

75
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,540
one then on how you can adapt and

76
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,360
transform asvs to serve your needs

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,480
and once we catch a hold of that maybe

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,640
how you could

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,340
make

80
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,019
compliance meet the demands of Agile

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,900
development by improving the way we

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,940
create policies how we serve them and

83
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,239
how we verify compliance all on how we

84
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,260
create and adapt the asps

85
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,000
so I hope you enjoyed the ride let's get

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
started so the application security

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,200
verification standard is an OS Project

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,540
one of the flagship projects

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,280
it's an application security standard

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,739
for web applications web services web

91
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,480
anything

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
and there are a few

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,819
sibling projects if you want there's one

94
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,280
for mobile applications there's one for

95
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
iot there's one for containers even

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,478
there's a there's a few

97
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,000
projects in the same venue which could

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,860
be interesting to to also consider

99
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,340
because this has a laser focus on web

100
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,479
applications but if you're

101
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,160
containerizing your application you also

102
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,900
need to focus on container best

103
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,580
practices right so

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,979
it couldn't hurt to also look at the

105
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,280
other verification standard uh documents

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,419
out there

107
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,419
and the best thing is this project was

108
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,639
created to make sure that it addresses

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,880
all over step 10 exploits at what they

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,860
call level one so we'll discuss that in

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,340
a while

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,340
the idea behind asvs is that you can use

113
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,740
it as a measuring stick so you can say

114
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,680
okay this is how much trust I can put on

115
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,240
your system that you're trying to sell

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,340
me how much trust I can put on the

117
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,020
system that you're developing and asking

118
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,080
me to put in production based on

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,639
the confidentiality Integrity

120
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,380
availability of the data or any other

121
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,540
value that is for important for your

122
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,979
business safety even

123
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,860
you can use it as guidance so hey dear

124
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,919
developer are you developing an API hey

125
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,539
could you please take a look at chapter

126
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,039
14.

127
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,400
uh or 13 I think uh in during

128
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,020
procurement hey you're trying to sell me

129
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,500
these shiny fancy thing

130
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,460
which of these requirements do you

131
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,460
comply how much trust can I put on your

132
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,080
um on your system that you're trying to

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,580
sell me and the most important thing

134
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,820
here and which is perhaps a bit absent

135
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,620
from the asbs definition of always of

136
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,240
the document within the document itself

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,580
is that of software assurance

138
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,520
so basically this measuring stick is

139
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,100
trying to give us some assurance that we

140
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,560
can use this system for a purpose and

141
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,340
that it will function as intended and in

142
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,960
as much as possible is free from

143
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
vulnerabilities and it provides security

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,240
capabilities adequate to the threat

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,600
environment the business

146
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,940
demands that I have and it will be able

147
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,460
to recover or at least alert me about

148
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,800
intuitions and failures

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,600
so this is the definition of software

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,560
Assurance from Carnegie Mellon

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,180
and

152
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,419
this has been mapped within asbs in four

153
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,539
levels so zero you do what you want

154
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,819
customize it and then they provide you

155
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,460
three levels one two and three very

156
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,919
difficult one being okay you're just

157
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,500
starting get this

158
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,139
it get everyone to do this and you will

159
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,280
at least

160
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,460
be doing your due diligence if you have

161
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,039
something that is more exposed or more

162
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,160
uh relevant in in I don't know

163
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
confidentiality Integrity availability

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,940
data privacy whatever

165
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,039
then go for level two and you have

166
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,780
something that takes people to the moon

167
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,240
go for level three right so so these are

168
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,919
the levels of assurance that you need

169
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,199
for for for

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,560
um dealing with software

171
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,319
and asbs allows you in the different

172
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,259
levels to touch

173
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:26,300
on the the whole devops cycle so uh

174
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,520
devops configuring deployment and

175
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,319
afterwards assurance and verification so

176
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,620
it allows you to demonstrate so what it

177
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,199
is uh covering so these are all

178
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
requirements that might be covered

179
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,740
and last slide regarding a well one

180
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,240
before last

181
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,020
um

182
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,199
it has 14 chapters

183
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
and it touches on a lot of topics that's

184
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
very important so architecture

185
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
authentication session management Access

186
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,580
Control

187
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,979
validations annotation and encoding so

188
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,560
probably my my top three of these are

189
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
number five

190
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
number eight

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,400
12 and 13. so if you ask me this is the

192
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,199
least the short list of requirements I

193
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,300
would give to most of the developers I

194
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,039
work with because these are the things

195
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,900
they're doing pretty much all the time

196
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,259
and how it looks like it's like this

197
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,479
it's a it's a document written in

198
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,560
markdown kept in GitHub translated into

199
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,820
multiple formats

200
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,440
and it basically has a section as we saw

201
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,179
uh apis chapter 13 apis section one

202
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,820
generic web server security and within

203
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,580
Section 1 chapter 13 we have a list of

204
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,680
requirements and it basically tells you

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,720
okay these three requirements are

206
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,399
suitable for level one

207
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,620
the rest for level two and three and

208
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,920
they map to a cwe

209
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,519
so one thing that that I find a bit

210
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,180
annoying is okay what is CW 116 I don't

211
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,800
know it by heart

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,380
and the markdown doesn't have a

213
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,060
hyperlink so I cannot go there so I have

214
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,580
to go to cwe type in and I thought okay

215
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,279
well if I'm in a PDF and I'm watching it

216
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,279
I mean reading it on my device I want to

217
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,920
click on it and encoder so those are

218
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
some of the changes that I have proposed

219
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
to asbs

220
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,580
and it all falls within this this

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,740
um perspective of adopting and

222
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,540
transforming asps so this is the time

223
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,480
where you should really really uh answer

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,940
your polls answer the polls because now

225
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,399
I'm I'm gonna start uh going through the

226
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,480
polls

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,100
okay

228
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,580
so let me see the results so are you

229
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,220
have you tried okay I have 29 responses

230
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,440
for trying to adopt so 21 out of 31 so

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,700
two-thirds

232
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,820
a half tried or are trying to implement

233
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,880
asps as the policy or guideline for

234
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,980
software development in their company so

235
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,880
you probably are daunted by the task so

236
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,220
where do I start what do I take

237
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,959
how can I map it right

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,860
so

239
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,279
let me tell you my story

240
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,040
2013 I was sitting in a conference

241
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,399
appsec conference in Hamburg

242
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,779
um

243
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,160
and I was

244
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,260
just like you in the audience watching

245
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,540
in that case Jim maniko or in that

246
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,459
instance I was watching Jim manika talk

247
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,680
about the asbs and the whole passion

248
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
that he brings when he talks about it

249
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,920
because he likes it even more than they

250
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
always top 10. so I was like really

251
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,079
impressed by it and I looked for it and

252
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,480
some years passed by

253
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,720
and then the season of the time at the

254
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,040
company I used to work for in the past

255
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,140
says hey

256
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,120
I need a list of requirements for

257
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,880
software development and my team starts

258
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
working on an ad hoc list of whatever

259
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,540
they could think of based on their

260
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,440
experience

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,899
and I'm like guys guys stop stop stop I

262
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,880
know that what we should be doing take a

263
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,320
look at this one and

264
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,200
and and and they were really happy about

265
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,060
it hey this is fantastic it covers

266
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,459
everything we need networking session

267
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,380
management all the chapters that we have

268
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,579
discussed hey let's do it let's adopt it

269
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,279
but then what happens is you go to your

270
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,279
company you take a document

271
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,800
that's not very intimidating but it's

272
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
like I know a few

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,200
tens of pages a few thousand pages

274
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,839
and it just doesn't look and feel like

275
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,100
the policies you have in your company

276
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,860
right

277
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,420
it's written in a different way it's

278
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,240
made in tables it has some text which is

279
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,100
not bad but

280
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,200
but do you want to keep all the text do

281
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,180
you want to adapt it hey do you want to

282
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,560
change the name

283
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
that was one thing we wanted to change

284
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,620
right because we wanted it to be

285
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,620
applications security requirements

286
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,000
guideline not application security

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,339
verification guideline we wanted to use

288
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,260
it for development

289
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,820
so

290
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,360
if you're in in Apostle looking at oh my

291
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,920
God how am I going to do this so I need

292
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,380
to change the content which requirements

293
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,899
which controls do I want to keep then I

294
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,079
need to maybe map it to other policies

295
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,320
hey Upstream they're making changes

296
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,600
there's a new release coming up how do I

297
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,000
keep in track with that

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,640
the company I used to work for had a was

299
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,740
so fancy that they had their own

300
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,380
corporate fonts so any policy you

301
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,680
publish internally in a PDF has to use

302
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,500
this corporate policy my core corporate

303
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,639
funds sorry

304
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,100
so I need to change the fonts I cannot

305
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,779
use Ariel or whatever was being used at

306
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:52,680
the time

307
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,279
the structure hey does it fit in in the

308
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,079
template of policies that my company has

309
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
maybe not and the last but not least

310
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,440
okay if I want to make this a policy

311
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,139
who do I need to talk to and how do I do

312
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,180
it what's the process right so these are

313
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,320
some of the questions that might be

314
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,300
going through your head so these are the

315
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,860
things that might be

316
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,740
troubling you right now and and

317
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,720
um I'm not sure if everyone has answered

318
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,820
the the polls but I'll take a look at

319
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,800
the at the polls for uh process for

320
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,600
creating text and uh

321
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,540
of a policy so

322
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,220
basically if you want to see the answer

323
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,360
we can see that

324
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,200
some I'm very surprised that uh half of

325
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,300
the group creates them and maintains

326
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,639
them in some sort of source Control

327
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,639
software

328
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,360
what I lived in the company I used to

329
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,459
work for was Word files going back and

330
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,800
forth and if you have ever tried to

331
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,620
merge three or four different word files

332
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,180
together you know that's

333
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,700
that's something for path when you are

334
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,160
very bad boy right or something else I'm

335
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,500
very surprised to see something else so

336
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,139
I I'm really curious to see to

337
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,180
understand how anyone would be creating

338
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,100
that

339
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,720
policies without words or or something

340
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,180
to keep track of them

341
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,320
so

342
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
the process is

343
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,519
to adopt it

344
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,279
relatively straightforward you go to

345
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,380
oasp asbs

346
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,899
with your account

347
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,040
you Fork it

348
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,920
and then you add a second remote to that

349
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,519
that pulls puts or points to your

350
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,260
internal source code versioning solution

351
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,199
whatever you call it bit pocket gitlab

352
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
GitHub GitHub Enterprise doesn't matter

353
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,420
right so just something that also speaks

354
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,579
kit

355
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,560
you can also socialize this repository

356
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,459
so

357
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,500
you can change how policies are created

358
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,839
within your company by making the

359
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
repository public so that you can get

360
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,300
feedback from your constituents hey this

361
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,800
requirement is not understandable and

362
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
you can even feedback that to the OS

363
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,459
Community right because that's the idea

364
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,899
that we improve this uh

365
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,079
standard together

366
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,160
and then the best thing you could do

367
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,560
enable to be your in in order to be able

368
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,620
to keep in sync is branch of Main and

369
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,800
create your own internal branch

370
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,660
so that you can keep track of Upstream

371
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,579
in one and your internal changes here

372
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,860
and you can then def or do whatever you

373
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,180
need to do

374
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,519
and last but not least

375
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,820
try to keep them in sync right so that

376
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,920
was the easy part so

377
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,760
I

378
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,160
give me just a second

379
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,820
to go to the Repository

380
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,139
so if I go to the Repository

381
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,899
you can see I have made a couple of

382
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,240
branches

383
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,180
for the purpose of this talk I Branch

384
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,620
off of Master to create a OS appsec

385
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,839
all right so within OAS absec I'm

386
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,579
working right now and I will be

387
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,459
modifying the file on the fly with you

388
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,639
to see what uh how we can adapt it all

389
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,620
right which is I think the most exciting

390
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,860
part

391
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,019
so we have that

392
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,000
um now let me move to the next slide

393
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,240
so now we want to adapt the contents so

394
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,699
what do we need to do we need to edit

395
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,980
the content so the markdown files we

396
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,060
need to

397
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,120
edit remove add text

398
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
change the the flow of the document if

399
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,079
you want

400
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,600
but we need to keep whatever we do a

401
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,220
reference to the original to comply with

402
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,280
the license which is CC by SA so you can

403
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,780
use it for commercial purposes you just

404
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,559
need to say this is derivative work from

405
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,939
OS asbs

406
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,679
CC by SA

407
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,359
then

408
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,939
once you have the content you change the

409
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,280
form so do you need

410
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,339
a title page doing a title page with

411
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,679
colors with your logo do you need

412
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,660
something special in the headers in the

413
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,080
Footers do you need

414
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,200
different fonts this all you can change

415
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,559
and then produce the outputs so you

416
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,640
might want Json CSV files Excel sheets

417
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,880
or CSV Excel is probably the same uh

418
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,660
Word documents PDFs XML

419
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,520
all of these are applicable right so

420
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,200
depending on how you're serving your

421
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,299
requirements you might need one or the

422
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,418
other

423
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,660
so if you haven't yet looked at the at

424
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,660
the repository it would ask you to go

425
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,360
take a look at it

426
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,760
um the repository looks pretty much like

427
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,960
this so it has all the versions of

428
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,919
asbs all the way to the current one

429
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,400
if you open the folder en you will find

430
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,260
the English sources which are the base

431
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,299
sources for the current version if you

432
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,120
look in folder 4.0 you will see that

433
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,160
there's also French and Spanish and

434
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,679
German and Farsi and I don't know

435
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,120
there's there's a few other languages

436
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,600
there so in the

437
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,039
5.0 version it's easy because we only

438
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,460
have English

439
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,140
and we will see that the chapters are

440
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,200
ordered sequentially so look at this we

441
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,080
have a header which is a jaml file it's

442
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,940
the only none markdown file and I'll

443
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,919
explain you why in a second

444
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,780
then we have

445
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,460
okay this one shouldn't be there this

446
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,799
one has been deleted but don't worry

447
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,020
about that so we have the front space

448
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,020
the header the preface and all these

449
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,620
matches

450
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,020
the document right so we have

451
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,580
table of contents

452
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,380
and if you look at the document you will

453
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,299
see that it follows the flow so we have

454
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,100
the front this piece

455
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,600
we have the pre-phase using asbs

456
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,039
assessment and certification and then we

457
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,620
jump into the requirements V1 through

458
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,720
v14

459
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,200
Plus appendixes

460
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,360
it's older right so this is

461
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,760
this is the re the repository structure

462
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,620
this is how

463
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,419
where you would be making any any

464
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,460
changes

465
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,679
and how to adapt it so so let me let me

466
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,020
discuss that a little bit so you will

467
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,740
see we have

468
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,340
markdown as the input format

469
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,260
and there's something called pandok

470
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,360
which is a universal document or

471
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
translator you can call it so it

472
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,080
basically looks at something like

473
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,820
markdown

474
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,660
take some templates from other formats

475
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,480
for example latex or or worth

476
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,200
and generates based on that word latic

477
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
PDF HTML and the multi to the formats

478
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,059
right so this is this is what pandok is

479
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,280
being used for why pandok I don't know

480
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,559
it was there when I got there so

481
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,799
asbs is using pandok for ages now and

482
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,820
this is what it is so

483
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,380
if you have ever worked with later you

484
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,720
know it's a pretty frequent thing to

485
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,940
work with it's uh it has a lot of

486
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,940
dependencies and it's you might not have

487
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,320
all the dependencies that you need to be

488
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,640
able to produce the document and it

489
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,400
takes hours to get everything right

490
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,140
so so it

491
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,960
it is not a nice idea but then we need a

492
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,720
build environment for this

493
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,600
and then there's also a python stage so

494
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,580
the markdown the same markdown that we

495
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,520
had is parsed through some python for

496
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,799
producing Json XML and I think I forgot

497
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
to include CSV here

498
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,240
so when you look at this together

499
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,120
when you say hey I want my my asvs what

500
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,740
is it that you actually want so I want

501
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,220
my markdown files to be read by pandok

502
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,020
and I don't care about the environment

503
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,720
it is built in I just want a PDF a word

504
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,780
and the and the a word file out of it

505
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,179
and I want my Json XML and and whatever

506
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,860
else I want from there or maybe I don't

507
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,740
maybe I just want the PDF so I don't

508
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,500
care how but just give me that

509
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,679
and this has been made possible through

510
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,960
at least in in the version five version

511
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,940
four also works because I did it in

512
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,559
version four and then made a pull

513
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,640
request

514
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,500
there's a there's a Docker file

515
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,539
definition within the repository this

516
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,700
Docker file has everything you need to

517
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,080
run pandok and Python and later so it

518
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,419
produces all documents without you

519
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,159
having to worry much about it the only

520
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,260
thing you need the only requirement is

521
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,600
Docker or something that can run a

522
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,880
container like Docker I know now the

523
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,159
docker is um

524
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080
no longer completely open source for for

525
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,720
at least in the windows version

526
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,460
um you need a license if you work in a

527
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,380
company that has more than I don't know

528
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,600
how many employees or Revenue you might

529
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,620
want to look at any of the other

530
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,120
Alternatives in the end it doesn't

531
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,980
matter it's just a container so take the

532
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,059
container run it in whatever and

533
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,320
containerized environment you have and

534
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,080
it will produce this for you so

535
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,919
how to give asbs your personal touch

536
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,100
let's change the title

537
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,000
right so

538
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,340
this is all metadata

539
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm not sure if the font is good enough

540
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,820
so let me

541
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,700
I hope the font is I didn't think about

542
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,679
this before sorry I'm not exactly sure

543
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,919
how to make the fonts bigger uh tcps

544
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,039
code should be trivial but I'm sorry I

545
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,600
cannot change the font right now I don't

546
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
want to spend any time on that

547
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,639
so what I want to show you is

548
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,919
usable it's fine it's visible thank you

549
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,500
very much for the feedback okay so what

550
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,600
have I changed

551
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,980
so remember my my base document

552
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,179
um this one here sorry

553
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,799
so you can see the title application

554
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,200
security verification standard 5.x

555
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,220
bleeding expression 2021

556
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,460
and it has the OS blog okay so I want to

557
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,020
adapt that to my company

558
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,140
so imagine I work for Acme you know the

559
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,360
the Road Runner and the coyote acme.com

560
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,460
so

561
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,320
Acme application security requirements

562
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,400
policy

563
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,159
for software development and acquisition

564
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,159
it's been created in the year 2022

565
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,880
I wanted to have a logo I want the logo

566
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,100
to be five centimeters in in width

567
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,980
that's two inches more or less

568
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,559
and actually my corporate policy

569
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,760
dictates I have to have this backgrounds

570
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,200
uh that your company I used to work for

571
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,480
had one brushed aluminum something

572
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,059
background for older policies to make it

573
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,140
more elegant

574
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,900
so basically you can take any one of of

575
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,659
these or your own so if I if you if you

576
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:44,760
allow me you can see here it's uh

577
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,780
it looks like this

578
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,080
did it open it didn't open that one

579
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,720
or like that so it's all just the same

580
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,000
style different colors

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,460
so I can basically just go and say okay

582
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,720
I want you to take excuse me

583
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,700
I want you to go and take background

584
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,460
number two out of the list

585
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,880
I want to have this unique identifier

586
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,460
for the policy on the left hand side

587
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,039
I want to have the title in the center

588
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,380
and I want to have the logo of my

589
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,760
company on the right hand side on the

590
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,780
header

591
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,940
I also want you to have the the page

592
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,400
number on the right hand side on the

593
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,679
footer

594
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,480
and you might ask why do we need

595
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
Japanese because there's one requirement

596
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,720
somewhere that has the ah symbol for for

597
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,419
kanji and I think some Hindi symbol as

598
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,080
well

599
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
that's why we need it

600
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
um we will be using Deja Vu Sans and

601
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,880
Source Sans for uh code or or quoted

602
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,039
things so these are the changes that I

603
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,440
so before even touching the rest of the

604
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,159
code

605
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,260
we can try to change that so

606
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,520
how does that work

607
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,059
again so I I changed the the header and

608
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,679
then I need to make a change to the make

609
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,220
file because the output

610
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,200
has a name so that cannot be changed

611
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,700
here that has to be changed in the make

612
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,620
file and you will see that in the make

613
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,900
file I have changed

614
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,840
the file name OS application security

615
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,500
verifications

616
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,539
requirements and left everything as it

617
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,980
was

618
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,020
so if if you have been around

619
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,000
development for long enough you know

620
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,340
make files is how

621
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,340
in the past I would say in the past 10

622
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,860
years ago maybe still you can do this

623
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,140
you used to download the source code

624
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,360
repository version to clone it run

625
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,220
configured and then make and then make

626
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,380
install it's the same thing so it's a

627
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,059
it's a make instruction that will be run

628
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,279
so let me see if the guts of the Denmark

629
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,860
with me to show you how to create it

630
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,918
um

631
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,039
foreign

632
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,419
so you will see I run

633
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,179
Docker run

634
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,580
I don't want the container to persist I

635
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,520
want to mount a volume relative to the

636
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,559
to the position I am in so I actually

637
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,500
want to mount uh so let me let me first

638
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,080
change to to the to the version five see

639
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,919
the

640
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,740
5.0 I mean this this is something you

641
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,480
can change of course in the in the

642
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,159
I could have added that but I'm just

643
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,020
lazy so I add the current directory and

644
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,940
mount it inside the container as data

645
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,740
and the container is called asvs

646
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,020
document Builder I named it that way it

647
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,820
doesn't exist in GitHub you have to

648
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,740
build it

649
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,539
and I want the PDF output

650
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,559
so when I do that

651
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,740
it runs a series of Transformations on

652
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,200
the markdown

653
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,460
um you don't have to worry too much

654
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,620
about it one thing that changes is for

655
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,140
the PDF as I said the cwe becomes a

656
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,559
hyperlink

657
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,179
and it is done so I have created the

658
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,400
document so you will see it transforms

659
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,700
to latex I am using Excel latex because

660
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,460
of the of the non-ascii characters

661
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,220
and I'm using a header called ice Fogel

662
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,820
so I'm using a template called icefoggle

663
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,779
um which is great for for latex so if I

664
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,840
look into the dist

665
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,039
directory you will see that it was

666
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,539
created right now

667
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,159
so I'll just copy that to somewhere

668
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,940
where I can show it

669
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,840
so give me just a second to show it now

670
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,379
it is there

671
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,559
so boom bada boom I have changed the the

672
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,080
text I have changed the document now you

673
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,100
can see

674
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,380
it has the title I wanted

675
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,260
it has my my background for the title

676
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,440
page it has my logo on the front page it

677
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
has my logo on the right hand side my

678
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,179
title my policy identifier and the page

679
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,260
number

680
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,899
so far so good right now I want to make

681
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,700
some changes to the text

682
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,679
so what do we want to change in the text

683
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,260
so let's see I

684
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,240
deleted the whole preface I don't need

685
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,220
the preface because that's great for a

686
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,960
general awareness document I don't need

687
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,940
it in a policy

688
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,059
uh in how to use the document I

689
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,039
basically could say okay this policy

690
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,960
defines so you see I changed the text

691
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,919
there

692
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,299
functional non-functional requirements

693
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:05,220
I then change this because this was

694
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,380
overflowing and then I removed the

695
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,380
contributors or the case studies

696
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,600
and I could keep on doing changes right

697
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,700
but I mean this is this is just what I

698
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,020
wanted to change so because this has

699
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,059
been already done I can show you the

700
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,340
output here and the one thing that I

701
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,520
changed that I did not show was

702
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,600
at the very beginning

703
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,080
so you can say this is uh derivative

704
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,380
work of let me make this bigger

705
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,480
of the application security verification

706
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,899
standards bioas under CC by sa and

707
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,720
license under the same term

708
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,260
now we have the whole using thing and

709
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
um

710
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,700
and here you could notice if I compare

711
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,799
it to the to the first document to the

712
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,299
application security development

713
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,340
standard

714
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,320
that the whole preface is missing right

715
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,520
so here we have the pre-phase what's new

716
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,860
and a lot of things and here I basically

717
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,600
don't have any preface

718
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,820
so that I have been able to change it

719
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,919
now I could be doing this for a long

720
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,960
more time but of course I don't have the

721
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,960
time for that anymore

722
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
but I hope you get the idea so you could

723
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,440
modify in markdown

724
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,200
I could modify in mark down the text

725
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,640
as I see fit so I could do I don't know

726
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,480
validation sanitization and encoding

727
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,679
come on

728
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,120
help me

729
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,039
okay it's not it's not working like that

730
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,059
it's working like this

731
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,340
say if I wanted to add here a a column

732
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,940
referring to other internal policies

733
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,039
which is something I did so I could have

734
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,899
here I don't know another column policy

735
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,820
boom and then add basically the same

736
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,340
story here

737
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,340
foreign

738
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:08,399
basically at the end of every line I

739
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,260
could start referring to one put two one

740
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,600
three whatever right or I could say I

741
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,799
know full

742
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,679
no pull

743
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,700
one two three four

744
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,399
dot 1.23 I don't know something like

745
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,260
that right so

746
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,580
I could modify the text here in this way

747
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,880
save it

748
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,120
rerun the

749
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,480
the output

750
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,220
copy it or you can see it and then and

751
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,220
then you will see uh that chapter 5 has

752
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,500
this extra column so these are the kind

753
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,539
of things I had to do to adapt it to the

754
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,279
company I used to work for

755
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,899
which is something you might have to do

756
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:58,140
on your own so now let me copy it

757
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,419
and then it's ready to be shown so if I

758
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,960
go to I think which was it was was it

759
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,520
chapter five

760
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,980
if I go to chapter 5 and after looking

761
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,200
at it I hope you can see that the policy

762
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,700
I mean it overflows a little bit but you

763
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,740
can see I have created a link to the

764
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,820
policy and I have created a hyperlink

765
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,620
from the PDF to the appropriate cwe

766
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,860
so if you see the cwe here we have

767
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,840
the the matching

768
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,960
CW so that makes it at least easier in

769
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,539
in my case and for my constituents to

770
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,379
understand the document

771
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,039
foreign

772
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,179
um there are instructions in the

773
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,740
repository on how to build the docker

774
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,539
container basically you have to run

775
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,700
Docker image builds whatever name you

776
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,220
want to give it Docker Docker files

777
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,840
go

778
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,240
and then when you run it it's a command

779
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,980
that you showed you right so Mount the

780
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,200
path where the repositories as the slash

781
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,419
data and if you don't pass any

782
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,880
parameters it will build all the formats

783
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,320
if you pass PDF tag markdown word is

784
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,179
something like that it will create just

785
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,260
those

786
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,359
and of course since

787
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,000
this is a container you could run this

788
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,300
in a CI pipeline to create your policy

789
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,260
document on demand

790
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,800
and when I started doing this I I got

791
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,500
inspired and I think I I had a glimpse

792
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,020
of what the future of of policies could

793
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,260
be right so

794
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,199
I think there's more results right now

795
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,259
um

796
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,300
so I was asking how do you check

797
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,760
compliance to all policies a system must

798
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,080
observed when developed and put into

799
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,199
production and

800
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,839
five uh five attendees said Excel sheets

801
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,599
uh 10 said uh some requirements

802
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,700
management software doors from IBM is

803
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,920
one of them as an example

804
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,580
um

805
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,339
another five said okay I don't know just

806
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,640
ad hoc whatever and some some even said

807
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,320
okay I know what compliance even means

808
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,700
right

809
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,320
um

810
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,880
another interesting question is okay

811
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,540
okay I didn't go to the result yeah so

812
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,960
how do you go from the policy document

813
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,420
to a ticket in your ticketing engine

814
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,579
call it whatever jira they have Azure

815
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,260
devops Sports whatever you want to call

816
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,520
it right

817
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,579
so either copy paste

818
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,339
or we don't and we figure out whether we

819
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,020
broke something very badly and get an

820
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,599
exception or something else something

821
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,820
else being I don't know interesting to

822
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,700
to know what that could be right

823
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,819
um

824
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,260
and we we have seen all four questions

825
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,700
so far so

826
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,560
that that's uh

827
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,960
oh that those are the challenges right

828
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,420
so if we look at compliance requirements

829
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,980
so how much time do I have I have 10

830
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,079
more minutes

831
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,500
so imagine this you are in a corporation

832
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,540
right this is you

833
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,000
or someone in your company or many many

834
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,740
people in your company right and you

835
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,400
have a constant stream of

836
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,099
guidelines

837
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:23,640
legal requirements laws gdpr cyber

838
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,880
security law in China India

839
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,980
um if you're doing critical

840
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,839
infrastructure pretty much all countries

841
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,700
have something there and you have to mix

842
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,980
and match right so there might be some

843
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,460
people working on on the OT side or your

844
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,260
companies some people on the I.T side

845
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,540
some people on data protection office

846
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,960
some people in export controls uh

847
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,320
and they all have to focus on

848
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,540
what is relevant to their domain of

849
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,480
knowledge and produce a policy for the

850
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
company to follow and this usually ends

851
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,339
up in some sort of

852
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:00,839
policy house

853
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,119
it could be a SharePoint it could be a

854
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,040
more structured thing but it ends up

855
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,839
somewhere

856
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,599
now the challenge is me as a developer

857
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,960
me as a project manager me as a consumer

858
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,079
of these policies I have to spend a

859
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,060
whole day looking for the relevant

860
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,520
policies for my use case and then I have

861
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,920
hundreds of pages to go through

862
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,380
which ones of those are relevant

863
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,119
and then at the end of it I have to

864
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,920
demonstrate compliance and these same

865
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,160
people have to buy it from me

866
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,859
and I might have my customers asking for

867
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,180
this demonstration of compliance

868
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,599
external regulators auditors

869
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,119
well it's it's quite a daunting task is

870
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,619
it isn't it

871
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,920
and we identify by looking at it three

872
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,280
bottlenecks so the first one is how do I

873
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,720
get the requirements I need when I need

874
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,820
them the second one is how do I

875
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,859
demonstrate that I complied with the

876
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,020
with the requirements right and the

877
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,420
fourth and the third one is how do these

878
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,680
people or or the Auditors here

879
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,680
validate the outcome to be met to match

880
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,619
the compliance right so so that's

881
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,260
that's the point where I say okay maybe

882
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,380
we have reached the end of

883
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,500
of traditional policy and compliance so

884
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,900
we cannot keep on working with PDFs

885
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,760
Excel sheets and questions that doesn't

886
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
scale and even if it were to scale the

887
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,720
data there is

888
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,820
disjoint from the reality of the

889
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,460
development or or putting something in

890
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,260
production right because you're working

891
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,420
in in a ticketing engine whatever

892
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,079
service now jira Azure devops word or

893
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,480
something like that some some kanban

894
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,420
board of some sort and and here Excel

895
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,780
sheets how did they even match

896
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,000
and then even worse

897
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
you do this exercise for one but then

898
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,900
you have five policies to comply with

899
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,060
and guess what all five want the same

900
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,400
requirements hey guys can at least agree

901
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,359
on one and I just serve you this result

902
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,640
and hey how do I demonstrate compliance

903
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,540
well

904
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,140
there are five offices and by by

905
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,200
um

906
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,140
what's the law the well I forgot the the

907
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,480
guy's name um so if you if there are

908
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,220
five offices producing policies you have

909
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,660
to produce five different demonstrations

910
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,700
of compliance everyone wants it in a

911
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,020
different way some want it in a word

912
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,060
file some want it in a PDF some well

913
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,500
that's a form or an Excel sheet

914
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,780
so let's change this let's try to do it

915
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,500
in a different way so hey I need my

916
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,380
requirements and I need them

917
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,240
some of them I need for the whole

918
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,619
process because they are part of the

919
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,140
software development life cycle SAS

920
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,800
tasked I vulnerability management so

921
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,900
there are things that I need to do all

922
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,520
along but there are things I need to do

923
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,619
in the scope of a Sprint hey I'm doing

924
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,079
an API right now what do you need to

925
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,240
take care of I'm doing a form

926
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,040
for the front end what do we need to

927
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,839
take care of I'm importing files or

928
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,339
exporting files or doing something with

929
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,200
files with my users or a third-party

930
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,359
system what are the requirements I need

931
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,320
right now not 130 requirements I need 10

932
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,660
requirements right now for this

933
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,078
Sprint

934
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,240
and that's where I say okay we have

935
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,380
just-in-time requirements and we have

936
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,320
long running requirements and the best

937
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,940
thing would be to get these requirements

938
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,880
from all my policies not from asbs right

939
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,640
because asbs is just one spoke in in the

940
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,960
wheel

941
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,720
and then how do we audit this so how can

942
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,700
I do the work once

943
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,020
and and be done with it

944
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,859
and I was just browsing yesterday

945
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,260
through through uh Twitter looking at

946
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,020
the RSA conference which was uh

947
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,140
um postponed a few months so I have five

948
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,180
minutes right

949
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,839
yeah sure I'm Gonna Be Ready to try to

950
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,260
help you questions but that's okay

951
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,060
thank you

952
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,140
um

953
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,180
so

954
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,400
basically what what the industry is

955
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,200
saying and everyone is realizing this

956
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,040
hey

957
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,560
how much effort do we spend in in

958
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,700
auditing

959
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,400
to meet compliance and in the end we're

960
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,500
not even happy with the outcome

961
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,660
we don't consider it to be really a

962
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,940
representation of reality

963
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,099
so what could we change

964
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,660
so if you look at the process I just

965
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,099
showed you

966
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,079
maybe you have the same idea I have

967
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,000
which is

968
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,260
hey

969
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,720
when we create a policy

970
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,119
why don't we create it as markdown files

971
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,760
and store them in gitlab so

972
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,920
there's perfect revisioning of my policy

973
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,680
which is ISO 27001 super compliant so

974
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,960
all my policies follow a structured path

975
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,380
to Creation Edition and I can trace back

976
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,480
to who made which change when and even

977
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,540
have a discussion around it right

978
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,660
now the beauty of it is I can parse it

979
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,180
just like I just showed you to produce

980
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,180
PDFs that live in whatever Cemetery of

981
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,359
data we decided to put our policies but

982
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,040
there's a more exciting aspect to it

983
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,680
since I can produce Json or XML out of

984
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,099
it I can fit a requirements document or

985
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,040
a requirements Gathering system like the

986
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,780
security knowledge framework as an

987
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,339
example

988
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,160
where I can then go as a customer and

989
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,000
say this is what I'm doing

990
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,619
and I get exactly the requirements that

991
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:38,700
I need

992
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,060
and I get them delivered to where I work

993
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,700
where do I work I work in jira I work in

994
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,800
Azure devops Sports I work in I know

995
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,420
help me out any other project management

996
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,099
tool

997
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:52,440
and I say tickets to them

998
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,300
and the beauty of that is when I close

999
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,760
the ticket with a commit I have a

1000
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,640
traceability of what security

1001
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,160
requirement was closed when as part of

1002
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,099
which story which then allows me

1003
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,839
to give

1004
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,540
a reporting mechanism to these

1005
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,060
constituents inside the company or disco

1006
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,460
instituents outside of the company so

1007
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,319
everyone can know which requirements

1008
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,380
were met and see that we're compliant

1009
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,300
and of course I'm not the first person

1010
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,160
to think of this I mean if if there is

1011
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,140
something very regulated is the federal

1012
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,000
government in the United States

1013
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,119
so nist the National Institute of

1014
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,740
Standards and technology has come up

1015
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,480
with something they called Oscar the

1016
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,800
open security controls assessment

1017
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,760
language

1018
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,819
which allows you to set to work with XML

1019
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:42,060
Json or yaml files to create catalog

1020
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,540
models so asvs could be one catalog

1021
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,380
anist 853 would be another catalog ISO

1022
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,520
27002 would be another catalog now

1023
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,040
by creating a profile based on whatever

1024
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,740
is relevant to your company CIA whatever

1025
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,440
you mix and match and you say these

1026
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,260
rules from this these catalogs these

1027
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,819
many catalogs are the ones I want to

1028
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,940
have for systems of this type in these

1029
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,680
characteristics and that allows you to

1030
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,420
create a

1031
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,000
component model and a system model with

1032
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,040
everything that should be checked and

1033
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,540
that allows you to have continuous

1034
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,640
assessment which is part part of what

1035
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,560
the American government calls the FED

1036
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,839
ramp

1037
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,440
so

1038
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,599
I'm closing in two slides so

1039
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,460
keep your policy house do you still need

1040
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,099
it but serve your requirements in a way

1041
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,640
that's friendly to your consumers

1042
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,819
and if possibly ask your consumers what

1043
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,260
they need and serve them just what they

1044
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,980
need

1045
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,560
and integrate with your ticketing API

1046
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,880
for demonstration of compliance so

1047
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,900
I hope it was clear that adopting and

1048
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,099
adapting asbs is actually not that hard

1049
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,260
now that I showed you the path right I

1050
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,599
hope you can follow this path asbs is

1051
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,160
definitely the best practice in the

1052
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,480
industry there's no need to create your

1053
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,440
own

1054
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,660
and

1055
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,780
if your company goes this way you can

1056
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,180
change the way your company does policy

1057
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,619
and compliance and move towards

1058
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,560
something closer to policies code and

1059
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,960
with that I'm open for questions I hope

1060
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,700
I made a

1061
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,160
one minute of delay sorry

1062
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,440
thank you very much it was very nice

1063
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,079
very interesting very entertaining and

1064
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,079
so many questions we got as well so

1065
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,760
first question just

1066
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,700
um uh common ones so will you be able to

1067
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,800
provide slides for the stock somewhere

1068
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,300
would you like

1069
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,060
um certainly I've actually haven't I

1070
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,040
think I'll send them to to the

1071
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,880
conference organizers and they will

1072
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,520
have the slides so of course the slides

1073
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,859
are there to be shared with everyone

1074
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,440
great thank you very much second

1075
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,960
question is given this Universal policy

1076
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,720
format have you done any work thinking

1077
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,160
on policy as code AS example as an input

1078
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,200
to automate a tooling to find violations

1079
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,260
against policy and for the tool to serve

1080
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,540
displays a relevant part of the policy

1081
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,540
on the violation since nobody should be

1082
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,660
expected to read policy documents

1083
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,500
yes so to answer the question I the

1084
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,260
Third several points here to attack

1085
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,300
right so the first one is

1086
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,420
right right here and one steps one and

1087
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,380
two so

1088
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,260
I'm not sure if you're aware ISO 27002

1089
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,220
just released a new version in February

1090
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,599
or April this year and I'm not sure

1091
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,339
either two or four the month two or the

1092
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,720
month four

1093
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,480
which is great it's it's a very nice

1094
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,640
policy well not policy standard document

1095
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,859
so I have adapted that standard document

1096
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:55,920
into markdown and I created a parser

1097
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,319
that reads the markdown and transforms

1098
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,319
it into Json and from Json into an old

1099
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,780
school catalog compliant format

1100
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,599
now my intention is to keep on doing

1101
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,300
this with with asbs so to create to be

1102
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,619
able to create a an oscalized

1103
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:15,300
representation of asvs

1104
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,359
so that we can use the oscal tools for

1105
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,760
exactly this so first of all first of

1106
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,440
all serving the requirements based on

1107
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,000
profiles

1108
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,520
and then the the the com serving the

1109
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,380
requirements all the way down to the to

1110
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,359
the ticketing system so if you have them

1111
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:31,859
in your ticketing system you have

1112
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:33,420
perfect visibility whether they have

1113
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,579
been met or not now

1114
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,460
based on other tooling you can then

1115
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,980
cooperate whether the the implementation

1116
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,540
is correct or not right so you have your

1117
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,220
SAS and your test and with that pen

1118
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,720
testing you can check whether they

1119
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,339
actually meet the standard

1120
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,680
I hope that answers the question

1121
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,020
be good thank you very much uh another

1122
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,540
question is how good was the reception

1123
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,359
of the adoption of the isvs with your

1124
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,640
former and current employees and how

1125
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,099
much time did it take you to adopt it to

1126
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:03,859
the company expectations

1127
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:06,980
so to be honest it took me quite a while

1128
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,520
to adapt it

1129
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,680
um because I had to learn pandok I had

1130
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,720
to learn I had to create the the

1131
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,060
environment so I got it running on my

1132
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,579
machine mistake I couldn't replicate it

1133
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:22,560
later so I had to create a Docker

1134
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,480
container around it and then I open

1135
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,400
sourced it so I I gave it back to the

1136
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,079
community so that anyone can follow my

1137
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,599
my trail right so

1138
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,839
if you saw it it wasn't too difficult so

1139
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,880
the thing that was really time consuming

1140
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,099
was matching all requirements to

1141
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,020
existing policies somewhere else and

1142
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,880
pointing to those policies

1143
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,280
so that was an effort that we had to do

1144
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,319
as a team

1145
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,300
how much time exactly I couldn't tell

1146
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,700
but it was a little bit labor intensive

1147
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,940
now since icefogle has been introduced

1148
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,440
as a template for creating the document

1149
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,480
and there's a build environment for you

1150
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,040
to consume

1151
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,560
it's really easy so I I hope

1152
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,599
it was clear how easy it is to change

1153
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,240
the document and adapt it to your own

1154
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,760
requirements so

1155
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,040
it shouldn't take you too long uh

1156
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,140
reception fantastic

1157
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,780
everyone liked it in my previous company

1158
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,819
they're still using it

1159
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,740
um it helps when you're threat modeling

1160
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,660
to ask questions regarding these topics

1161
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,000
for example the first chapter is great

1162
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,380
for threat modeling so I always

1163
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,579
recommended it to the security

1164
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:29,300
architects

1165
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:31,200
um in the current company we are using

1166
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,319
it but we are using it in in a derived

1167
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,660
version so uh there's a there's another

1168
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,540
project from the uh open security Summit

1169
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,020
in which we have translated

1170
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,420
the requirements into gherkin stories so

1171
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,339
that they can be adapted to Agile

1172
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:50,220
working methodology

1173
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,000
um

1174
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,339
so the idea is that these gherkin

1175
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:54,599
stories which include the definition

1176
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,720
I've done so given something when this

1177
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,540
happens this is the expectation

1178
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,960
um this this this has been uh created so

1179
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,300
the adoption is not as great so we have

1180
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,460
to basically be holding hands with our

1181
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,160
developers to to do that but we're

1182
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,260
getting there

1183
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,060
very interesting thank you very much

1184
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,119
Luis uh another question is how to keep

1185
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,880
your local asvs direct policy

1186
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,619
synchronized with Upstream

1187
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,720
that's not this it depends a lot on the

1188
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,359
customization you made right so

1189
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:35,160
my advice could be to perhaps uh

1190
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,619
uh I mean it's not yet there but I I

1191
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,319
intend to provide and make a pull

1192
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,480
request for an oscalized version of the

1193
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,480
requirements so in my opinion the text

1194
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,760
around it is not as important for your

1195
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,040
internal policy as the control

1196
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,079
statements themselves

1197
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,940
so if you restrict yourself to the

1198
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,280
control statements they don't move

1199
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,460
around so they might change the sentence

1200
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,800
they might change a word a comma or

1201
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,079
something that can be managed the the

1202
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,460
whole

1203
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,859
text around it I would just ignore it so

1204
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,780
I I would probably

1205
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,900
recommend to start looking into Oscar

1206
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,440
and that allows you to have a a unique

1207
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,599
identifier for the version so if

1208
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,339
something changes Upstream

1209
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:23,400
then you can have a a change that

1210
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,460
triggers uh a match of your of your own

1211
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,619
very good thank you very much how to

1212
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,200
integrate asvs with other policies

1213
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,960
I could go against the Oscar way so as I

1214
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,460
mentioned I could

1215
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,599
um

1216
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,720
foreign

1217
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,480
catalog models from all my policies

1218
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,119
so basically it's a lot of work up front

1219
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,059
which pays dividends

1220
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,040
afterwards so

1221
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,619
if you can get not only SBS but other

1222
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,720
policies to be created in the same way

1223
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,640
you can start creating catalog models

1224
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,740
from the catalogs you can start creating

1225
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,079
profiles and the profiles already

1226
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,760
include the requirements from all

1227
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,260
teacher and policies

1228
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,420
I haven't found a better way to do this

1229
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,880
to this I mean you can always point in

1230
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,440
the table as I showed you to another

1231
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,760
policy

1232
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,980
but that's not as resilient as having it

1233
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,040
in one consistent

1234
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,058
profile definition

1235
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,680
thank you very much and I think it's the

1236
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,559
last question if nothing will appear how

1237
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,839
can I easily find which requirements I

1238
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,300
would need to observe for my Sprint from

1239
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,680
as yes

1240
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,380
I'm not sure if everyone is aware of the

1241
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,240
security knowledge framework

1242
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,400
so I'm not related to it in any way it's

1243
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,260
another Flagship project so you can

1244
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,540
access it uh here on demo security

1245
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,800
knowledge framework.org

1246
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,859
so basically the idea is you could adopt

1247
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:07,980
the SKF internally

1248
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,859
no not that one sorry for that I'll just

1249
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,960
get anywhere and that ask requirements

1250
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
and say okay what are you doing a web

1251
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,980
application

1252
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,960
which is the level of trust that you

1253
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,760
have in this or you must meet in this

1254
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,599
application level two

1255
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,359
um what are you doing I am I don't know

1256
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,280
a validation

1257
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,079
I need some validation because I have

1258
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,680
inputs from users or other systems so I

1259
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,119
have a need for input requirement

1260
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,559
validation

1261
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,859
I need sanitization for ssrf or

1262
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:42,780
something like that yes

1263
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,420
I need to Output user supplied input on

1264
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,220
the client side so I'm taking input from

1265
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,960
the users storing it the database and

1266
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,460
showing it back to the user and let's

1267
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,839
say just next for the sake of the

1268
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:52,920
presentation

1269
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,740
and let's say okay this is a new feature

1270
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,879
so this is the Sprint

1271
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,040
print 34 and panel form

1272
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,880
validation

1273
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,099
and if this thing works correctly it

1274
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:14,280
usually does but sometimes it has

1275
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,280
um

1276
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,300
where's the test to the form validation

1277
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,760
sprinters before so here you could see

1278
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,619
oh it's not working correctly I'm sorry

1279
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:29,040
for that it usually works correctly

1280
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,540
I don't know they made they made some

1281
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,220
changes so basically this one serves you

1282
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,740
the requirements in a very nice way with

1283
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,740
links to cwe it even includes links to

1284
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,700
other

1285
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,720
um

1286
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,880
projects I'm not exactly sure why it is

1287
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,280
not working right now but that's the

1288
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,680
problem of doing demos live right

1289
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,280
um

1290
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,500
so so yeah that's that's one way that's

1291
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,900
the best way uh the other way is to have

1292
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,300
people go through the document it's not

1293
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,400
not as nice as just answering three

1294
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,559
questions and getting a very concise

1295
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,300
list of requirements based on what you

1296
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,480
need

1297
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,220
perfect thank you very much Luis it was

1298
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,200
a great presentation so many information

1299
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,059
so many different slides so much

1300
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,880
information for for attendance uh

1301
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,260
anything else you would like to enter

1302
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,660
Then

1303
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,359
I think that is the biggest challenge

1304
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,619
is pardon is here this is the biggest

1305
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:28,800
challenge of them all getting the group

1306
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,319
of people that work on creating policies

1307
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,200
to work in a different way far away from

1308
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,020
Word documents or Excel sheets is

1309
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,000
perhaps the biggest challenge but if you

1310
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,740
can manage that

1311
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,540
the future of compliance for your

1312
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,700
company might be a lot better than it is

1313
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,879
now

1314
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,859
uh thank you and please contact Luis uh

1315
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:59,700
on the platform as well as ask any

1316
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,260
questions if you have and he will be

1317
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,220
able to answer as well
