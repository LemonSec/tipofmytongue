00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,379
mobile application security imperative

17
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,079
I think I'm hearing some background

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,420
noise sorry about that yeah apologies

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,820

Wales with deep experience within the

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,560
cyber security industry and mobile web

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,840
app development Oliver leads in parents

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
focus on mobile app security across

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Europe so Oliver are you ready to take

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,619

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,720
yes please do that thank you

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,020
okay is that coming pretty nice and

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,079
clear

40
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,820
everything is visible and everything is

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,180
Audible

42
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,959
hey guys thank you very much for joining

43
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,280
our session today

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,879
um

45
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,319
as if we introduced what we're going to

46
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,940
be talking through today is some of our

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,520
observations and our experience uh in

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,160
the world of mobile application security

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,599
uh some of the information that we've

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,040
gathered through our various different

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
activities we carry through such as

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,599
surveying and exploratory research

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,680
um so we're going to dive into this so

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,300
um we're going to start just by

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,519
discussing some of the industry uh

56
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,379
conversations that we have and one of

57
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,760
the biggest names out there is Gardner

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,099
uh gotten uh

59
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,080
uh very much for leaders in the space

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
it's an Emerging Market it's a very new

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
area and it's very much growing at a big

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,459
rate so we listen to these guys for

63
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,080
their observations from the wide

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,420
perspective across the industry

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,080
um

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,940
that big observation for you this year

67
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,700
is that mobile application Security will

68
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,319
be one of the biggest challenges for

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,599
Enterprises okay more apps are out there

70
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,459
more tension is going on to the security

71
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,080
of those applications

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,099
uh and the reward for uh exploiting

73
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,780
adaptations is getting bigger and bigger

74
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,220
okay especially as you're moving to a

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,500
lot of payments Etc there's a lot more

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,319
value in their Solutions there

77
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,540
we see this as well you know we can fill

78
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,980
this page we could have many different

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,659
slides and views on these different

80
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,840
stories that come out here all the time

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,739
um

82
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,379
it's almost a weekly weekly story now

83
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,739
where there's new exploits new leaks new

84
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,360
challenges uh that I've seen throughout

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,659
very well-known applications

86
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,180
it's going to keep continuing okay this

87
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,319
isn't going to change this isn't going

88
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,819
to go away the attention is never going

89
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,440
to leave the space as well the best we

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,599
can do is understand what those

91
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,640
challenges are start addressing them

92
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,459
early in the build Cycles as we develop

93
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,980
these Solutions and ensure that we are

94
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,980
taking a sensible approach to managing

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,200
this risk

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,000
so some of the activities I mentioned

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
before that's Imperium do is we we

98
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
really try to be thought leaders in the

99
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,100
space so

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,298
um we regularly survey uh independently

101
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,380
thought leaders in different spaces

102
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,199
technology leaders Etc to understand

103
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,940
what are they seeing in Industries in

104
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,800
the spaces that they operate in and what

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,820
are the challenges they're trying to

106
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,440
explore so I'm going to walk through a

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,960
few of these today with you

108
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,160
um so one of the first ones we wanted to

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
try and understand is as you're

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
deploying

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,520
um applications and you're addressing

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
the security uh that is required to do

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919
this what are the challenges okay what

114
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,040
do you perceive as uh the downside of

115
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
addressing this and the key takeaways

116
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,100
really are

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,620
um historically there's a big

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,520
trade-off between applying security

119
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,080
measures to a solution and how the

120
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,639
impacts the user experience okay and

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,020
this is one of the biggest concerns that

122
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,540
we see leaders have in the space

123
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,699
um as you then rest through that it's

124
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,680
the impacts with their cycle okay you

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,120
still want to be delivering you still

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,340
need to be hitting those goals uh you

127
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,240
still need to be doing it on the same

128
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,860
budgets okay you you bring a Security

129
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,120
Solutions but you don't want to be

130
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,160
bringing in additional security teams do

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,440
grow their Solutions so it needs to be

132
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
very low impact in that perspective as

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,560
well

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,880
um there's other ones there you know

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
there's many other areas size etc etc

136
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,539
okay

137
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,400
use experience is clearly the biggest

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,160
thing uh that impacts uh application

139
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,400
security

140
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,419
if we then take another look at another

141
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,919
area

142
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,740
okay so as we as we start looking into

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,320
uh again application security we want

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
the tasks the people most concerned

145
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
about so what areas are technology

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,940
leaders concerned about okay

147
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,479
um

148
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
leading leading for in a space right now

149
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,199
is data storage data storage and

150
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,720
transmission okay so as you collect data

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
or receive data to a solution uh is it

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,400
being received security has it been sent

153
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,740
to Securities have been generated

154
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,780
okay and then as you go down the chain

155
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,360
it's all about property and also supply

156
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,419
chain attacks as well okay so very much

157
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,919
common themes and as we talked about

158
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,320
there is a couple of slides ago these

159
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,699
are the things that are driving these

160
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:21,960
attacks I've been to in the real world

161
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,120
one of the biggest emerging trends that

162
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,280
we think is going to be next expecting

163
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,100
the uh like anything

164
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,840
repository has been uh effective and

165
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,258
things like that

166
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,000
and then I can start looking at Mobile

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
cases what's the biggest risk so if you

168
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
own a mobile application what is your

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
perception on you know where's your

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
assignment come from what is the risk

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,919
where's you know the data group's going

172
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,780
to be caused things like that so the

173
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,180
biggest one by far is malware installed

174
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,860
on the same device a very interesting

175
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,080
observation for that

176
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,740
um

177
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,360
and we see that as well in our data

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
we're going to be talking about this a

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,360
little bit later on Obsession but yeah

180
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,580
malware until side by side with the

181
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,740
device this is really a strong Trend

182
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,180
right now in the financial markets as

183
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,400
well where uh Trojans are being designed

184
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,460
to Target uh banking applications Etc uh

185
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,380
posing as

186
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,440
banking applications or targeting with

187
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,300
overlay attacks Etc and the data

188
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,199
uh some of the things official campaign

189
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,120
so Target position campaigns against

190
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,639
paragraph Grant or an application

191
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,620
and then one of the other big areas as

192
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,300
well is application Universal

193
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,560
engineering so taking an application

194
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,759
which is already present on the app

195
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,520
store for example uh repackaging it with

196
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,319
maybe malicious total malicious changes

197
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,360
to that solution and then we release it

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,380
from third-party App Store

199
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,240
one of the interviewers that we've seen

200
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,699
working in lately is we've released what

201
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,639
we in terms are Global Mobile protocol

202
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,500
and this is this imperium-led activity

203
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,840
that we carried out uh over the space in

204
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,800
the back end of the last year and

205
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,080
earlier this year and it's really our

206
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,300
perspective on what's going on in the in

207
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,759
the in the world of mobile security not

208
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,080
just in applications but in the

209
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Enterprise world as well and I wanted to

210
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,759
share some of the key observations

211
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,380
uh so one of the biggest things we've

212
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,340
seen is the mobile specific fishing has

213
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,720
been on the rise heavily and this has

214
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,160
really driven uh we believe from the

215
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,720
people are now are working comparing a

216
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
lot more people in Chicago starting to

217
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,259
travel a bit more and this has been

218
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,360
driving a focus around fishing web

219
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,220
traditionally maybe these type of

220
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,599
attacks may have been done on the

221
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,120
network level in public hotspots public

222
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,458
networks where people weren't visiting

223
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,478
those uh so

224
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,380
um a lot of the fishing sites we've

225
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,540
actually been analyzing that we've been

226
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,880
seeing out the are specifically targeted

227
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
from mobile devices and comprehensive

228
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,320
delivered to myself

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,260
um so of all fishing sites the majority

230
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,180
of those are focused at mobile device

231
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,779
users

232
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,640
uh some of the other areas as well so

233
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,480
um

234
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,060
when we looked at and this this was a

235
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,480
piece of research that we did um around

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,180
Financial applications okay so we

237
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,580
analyzed hundreds of the top uh

238
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,040
financial banking payment providing

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,140
Solutions Etc

240
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,279
um we found that approximately 81 of the

241
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,779
applications that are released in that

242
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,180
in just that vertical load are leaking

243
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,800
sensitive information so that could be

244
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
through uh cloud storage solutions it

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,420
could be through the libraries it could

246
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,360
be the way the code is implemented or it

247
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,800
could be through sdks that they're

248
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,420
importing a Solutions but there is

249
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,300
incredibly high amount of applications

250
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,100
out there not just in the financial

251
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,740
sector we just picked a vertical to

252
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,560
analyze but this is a trend across all

253
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,579
the different list groups

254
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,260
and there's many more different metrics

255
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,940
that we look for okay I mentioned before

256
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,700
so 10 of applications use some kind of

257
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,339
cloud services in the back end okay and

258
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,660
a lot of these cloud services that

259
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,040
people are using

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,640
um

261
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,120
are not implemented correctly okay so we

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,180
did a big piece of research last year uh

263
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,459
we we looked at over a million different

264
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,680
uh mobile applications across Android

265
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,000
and iOS

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,080
and about 131 000 of these we use

267
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,120
publicly available cloud services inside

268
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,820
them now these aren't secured cloud

269
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,680
services these are public buckets of

270
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,240
information

271
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,040
um which are exposing personal

272
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,220
information so we we've had a big Drive

273
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,920
last year and make really raising

274
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
Awareness on okay well you're using

275
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
cloud storage but are you using this

276
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,660
correctly okay and that was one of the

277
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,519
biggest challenges from last year that

278
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,200
we observed

279
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,459
some of the other things from the mobile

280
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,680
operator before

281
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,839
um we could we could you know go into a

282
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,920
lot of debt from these and what I will

283
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,180
invite you to do is reach out to us

284
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,320
following the session and we can

285
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,140
actually directly do default report on

286
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,279
this

287
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,980
um last year alone we discovered over 5

288
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,959
000 brand new pieces of malware okay uh

289
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,000
on a regular daily basis okay uh malware

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,620
is being generated constantly it's not

291
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,660
new uh elements of malware it's been

292
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,519
repackaged being re-released and

293
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,079
rebranded

294
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,200
um it's a very high churn activity

295
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
getting the smaller out of it

296
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,000
there's a massive increase as well on

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,680
zero deep vulnerabilities that have been

298
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,459
used to attack mobile devices

299
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,620
um there's organizations such as the

300
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,800
rhodium out there Etc who uh acquire and

301
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,160
resell uh vulnerabilities and exports

302
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,980
for mobile devices

303
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,120
last year sorry in 2020 as you know

304
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,680
everyone was starting to be but into

305
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,660
lockdown Etc

306
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,980
um they actually halted their

307
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,579
acquisition of uh iOS exploits because

308
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,399
they were saturated

309
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,640
so there is a big catalog not in the

310
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,579
public View and actually again to mobile

311
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,019
applications maybe they could be

312
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,660
application focused maybe they're you

313
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,700
know for example targeting WhatsApp or

314
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,459
they may be device targeted uh both have

315
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,040
implications for app developers though

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
so there is a big Market behind the

317
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,300
scenes that we don't have access to or

318
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,880
without visibility of but from just the

319
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,459
figures from Acquisitions group of d uh

320
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,440
that is a very right Market you know

321
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
there's a lot of money to be made from

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,800
security

323
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,320
again please do reach out to us if you'd

324
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,459
like to get a full copy of this report

325
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,959
we're more than happy to direct you

326
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,240
towards it

327
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,440
so some of the other things I want to

328
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,940
talk about uh just to kind of move

329
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,139
towards the back end of the session

330
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,579
today

331
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,160
um is to start understanding you know

332
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,160
some of the questions that we see around

333
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,740
different areas of mobile architecture

334
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,600
and security and also talk about some of

335
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,100
the best practices that we share our

336
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,380
customers

337
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,060
so when you start looking across the

338
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,220
software development lifecycle days what

339
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,380
we would see is four key areas and then

340
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,360
the areas that we specialize in as well

341
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,339
the first of those is mobile security

342
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,220
testing okay so this is the ongoing

343
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,440
assessment of mobile applications as

344
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,680
they're being developed on a ongoing

345
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,079
automated basis okay

346
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,459
some of the questions that we need to

347
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,440
ask in ourselves a lot more is you know

348
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,120
are we accessing and storing sets of

349
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,100
data and where are we doing that

350
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,839
okay and that's one of the big trends

351
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,220
again as we mentioned going on is about

352
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,459
how that data is screwed safely

353
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,839
um and if we start looking into the best

354
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,019
practices behind this you know as we as

355
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,180
we look at uh building mobile

356
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,279
applications what we recommend to all of

357
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,320
our customers and partners you know

358
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,000
start testing these mobile applications

359
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,220
early okay don't wait until you're about

360
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,139
to release it or send an application off

361
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,320
content testing to do a test one of the

362
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,680
biggest challenges our customers face is

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,339
um

364
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,339
they opened us and they can fail for

365
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,220
very simple reasons they're very

366
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,959
simple misconfigurations things that

367
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,160
we're missing things were where

368
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,560
obfuscation was not applied correctly

369
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,079
all these kind of very common areas so

370
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,820
um start testing early as you develop

371
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
the application not when you try to

372
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,060
release it okay it will make life a lot

373
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,740
easier and it would be

374
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,839
a cheaper process as well you won't have

375
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,120
a pen test you won't have delayed

376
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,920
releases Etc

377
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,079
when you do testing make sure you do

378
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,899
both static and dynamic testing

379
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,220
um I mentioned before about supply chain

380
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,040
attacks so one of the big areas that we

381
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,620
believe in is if you start doing Dynamic

382
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,260
testing with taking a compiled version

383
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,820
of application

384
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,940
apply it in a on a physical device and

385
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,740
apply Telemetry to see what happens as

386
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,380
you use it we've observed previously

387
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,440
where sdks or libraries that people have

388
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,860
found on open source sites through

389
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,120
Supply chains and recommendations no

390
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,459
statically those libraries are very

391
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,380
benign they don't have any malware

392
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,019
samples of phishing examples to speak of

393
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,000
but once they are delivered to a device

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,740
and they are running for a certain

395
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,199
period of time they then change their

396
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,720
posture where they may pull down some of

397
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
the content they may start working

398
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,639
different ways so definitely there's a

399
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,620
lot of value in both the static side but

400
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,440
also that Dynamic testing is critical

401
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,060
these Solutions should be highly

402
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
integrated inside your environment as

403
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,959
well they shouldn't be a new process so

404
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,199
you need to adopt and start uh having

405
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,139
new teams to manage you everyone has a

406
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,660
cittv pipeline for some sort of where

407
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,180
that is they're just using Jenkins to or

408
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,120
get pocket or something like that to

409
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,399
store data and just make sure it's

410
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,279
essentially accessible

411
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,380
or you are a mature uh cicer point where

412
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,459
you've got all your thoughts highly

413
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,560
integrated no matter where you sit

414
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,720
inside that journey of evolution inside

415
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,940
of the ICU pipeline

416
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,620
um start integrating early on so make

417
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,480
sure these testing Solutions are part of

418
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,240
that to that pipeline okay it means that

419
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,899
when you promote your builds or you

420
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,760
submit new code those kind of processes

421
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,800
you can trigger the testing so it means

422
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,180
you could trigger testing maybe on a

423
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,800
Friday afternoon that you will leave and

424
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,660
then on Monday when you come back you'll

425
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,279
have a set of results that you can then

426
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,519
start analyzing and going into

427
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,440
um also on that integration perspective

428
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,300
make sure you're also leveraging things

429
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
like differently if you're discovering

430
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,339
challenges in the applications one of

431
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,779
the best things to do is get those

432
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,820
straight back to developers okay make

433
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,620
sure those developers are fixing these

434
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,759
problems the students are identified

435
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,980
it's going to be a lot less expensive on

436
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,680
release Cycles if you're doing that

437
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,959
the testing criteria as well so uh

438
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,459
standardization so

439
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,300
um the solutions that we develop uh are

440
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,300
big use of the O was standard to kg for

441
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,199
example we just added uh Mass vs to the

442
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,940
security testing standards so every time

443
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,459
that you identify issues make sure you

444
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,040
understand what the implication is for a

445
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,980
security compliance framework or if you

446
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,439
are looking at financial markets PCI if

447
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,919
it's Healthcare HEPA uh or if it's if

448
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,480
it's been released in Europe you know

449
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,099
gdpr

450
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,660
um so make sure you you're not just

451
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,160
testing and looking for problems but

452
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,380
what it understands where that fits

453
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,500
inside

454
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,040
uh and this this should be a

455
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,179
collaborative approach okay there

456
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,620
shouldn't just be a closed cycle inside

457
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,540
the runway the security and development

458
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,280
team should be working together

459
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,760
to accept risks if they can't be fit or

460
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,919
at least be aware of risks associated

461
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,100
with the end artifacts

462
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,419
so we're going to move on to the next

463
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,500
section which is all around

464
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
cryptographic key protection okay so

465
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,640
this is really focused around how you

466
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,100
secure your keys your secrets

467
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,380
how you execute things such as

468
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,679
encryption decryption things

469
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,520
um

470
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,679
some of the questions that you know we

471
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,500
we ask our customers and people consider

472
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,020
is you know when you are leveraging keys

473
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,880
and encrypted Etc do you have a standard

474
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,860
practice across your mobile your web and

475
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,840
desktop applications

476
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,340
um one of the challenges that you can

477
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,960
fall into is if you don't have a

478
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,460
standardized approach your common

479
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,520
approach a common set of tools uh that's

480
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,940
when you start leaving gaps

481
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,900
um you need to start asking yourself

482
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,000
well okay so you're maybe securely

483
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,220
generating your keys but how do you

484
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,780
distribute this piece how do you store

485
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,480
those things okay so you need to make

486
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,620
sure and also when they're being used

487
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,059
okay to make sure those teams are

488
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,140
secured throughout all those different

489
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,360
processes

490
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,940
and then also that execution environment

491
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,940
okay so if you've delivered your key to

492
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,980
a degree based into a device how do you

493
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,660
ensure that that remains safe even in

494
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,480
the most insecure environment even if a

495
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,000
device is compromised okay operation you

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
need to ensure that those encryption

497
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,679
fees are not capable okay

498
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,520
um

499
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,620
it's a challenge it's a big area to

500
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,160
focus on uh but you know these all

501
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,500
solvable problems

502
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,780
it's all about the best practice uh

503
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,700
never partake using the software I think

504
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,620
it's you know one of the biggest most

505
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,940
common things that people consider

506
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,740
ourselves is you know don't leave the

507
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,500
secrets in Plainfield you know don't

508
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,760
leave them in a commit tickets

509
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,500
um that you can never party as well

510
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,720
try and limit your piece to a specific

511
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,780
purpose okay so if you are receiving or

512
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,520
streaming data for example make sure you

513
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
have a key that's dedicated to that

514
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,700
specifically

515
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,820
okay we use some keys is challenging

516
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,980
from both the security practice because

517
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,860
they're being used but then also if you

518
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,960
reusing it's not so be a challenge if

519
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,820
something changes you can connect your

520
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,159
you know all those keys are then updated

521
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,740
um

522
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,240
when you start looking at the

523
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,679
implementation of these kind of

524
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,980
solutions hardware-backed security

525
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,340
um is historically a big Trend I think

526
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,980
it's also a big challenge so if you look

527
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,600
at Hardware back Solutions such as you

528
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,059
know using Apple piecing from the Google

529
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,760
and uh Samsung solutions that you have

530
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,240
out in the message it limits the

531
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,760
potential user base that you have you

532
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,919
know if you're building a solution that

533
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,240
requires some kind of file with like

534
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,940
security and you're you want to have

535
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,919
adoption across every single Android

536
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,179
device

537
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,340
the cheaper Android devices don't have

538
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,660
support for those

539
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,640
uh so you're going to be immediately

540
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,120
reducing your your potential user

541
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
um it's also quite costly both from the

542
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,940
physical and and consumption basis okay

543
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,460
so software-based solution as are

544
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,520
definitely the way for a wider adoption

545
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,860
um and to be honest it makes life a lot

546
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,280
easier to design and infinitely

547
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
designing this movement for Android in

548
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,100
general instead of trying to design

549
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,740
solution for Samsung devices Google

550
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,100
devices

551
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,059
and make sure those keys are managed

552
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,039
throughout your employers and stuff so

553
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,419
it's all well and good you know having

554
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,940
security key generation

555
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,919
but then how do you deliver those keys

556
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,559
to the device then also how do you use

557
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,020
those keys once they're online

558
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,700
yeah so they're all really really

559
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,980
important things consider not just you

560
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,419
know is it securely stored on the back

561
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,820
end is it securely stored you

562
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,280
transmitted to these operators okay

563
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,919
really try to take advantage of why

564
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,539
because

565
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,280
which is a health address these great

566
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,280
protection gaps that you will have

567
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,380
and moving on to the the third area is

568
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,120
all around shielding okay so this is

569
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,260
really focused on

570
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,960
anti-tampering anti-reversing technology

571
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,299
so things to ask yourself you know what

572
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,799
protections do you put in place before

573
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,179
you release your after the App Store and

574
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,640
you spent a lot of time developing the

575
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,320
intellectual property and codes that

576
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,360
you're releasing okay

577
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,740
um

578
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,900
a good time open source

579
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,260
um but that you know once you you start

580
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,780
building commercial Solutions Etc as

581
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,799
well

582
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,179
um there's definitely challenges around

583
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,640
the libraries and some of the embedded

584
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,440
elements you know some of those need to

585
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,020
remain secure because they're doing uh

586
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,880
very

587
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,580
bespoke unique sensitive activities how

588
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,980
to ensure that they are

589
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,740
protection against static attack

590
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,539
and then also

591
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,700
your applications yeah

592
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,500
against being tampered and we've

593
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,179
published on answers okay this is a big

594
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,620
area and I mentioned this in the

595
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,100
statistics early on is

596
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,260
how how can we ensure that if you're

597
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,900
reaching a great quality solution out

598
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,940
there that no one's going to repackage

599
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,679
it we had a recent experience where we

600
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,620
were talking to a hotel company

601
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,539
um they spent years developing this

602
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,539
mobile application for the hotel thing

603
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,840
and they inadvertently by accident came

604
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,340
across a clone of their application

605
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,200
being required for a completely

606
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
different Hotel chain a big difference

607
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,679
company but they just re-skinned their

608
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,299
application and reused their application

609
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,780
by reverse engineering so

610
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,039
um there's a lot of challenges out there

611
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,600
around how you

612
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,220
check your Brands but also about

613
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,260
identity that you're building

614
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,320
some best practices on Space

615
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,120
um there's a lot of alignment needed

616
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,679
okay so both from the privacy and

617
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,020
product security team there's a lot of

618
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,760
understanding that you need to have and

619
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,100
make yours clear around things like data

620
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,020
classifications and how you protect

621
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,760
those different narrative data okay so

622
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,100
we're not just talking about keys at

623
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,039
this point is Secrets it's uh how do you

624
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,780
authenticate users and those kinds of

625
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,780
things URLs strings all those kind of

626
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,460
things

627
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,900
and then also from the the product

628
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,940
security team you know if something does

629
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,860
go wrong what counter measures do you

630
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,120
want to take

631
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,700
you know which pieces of code are the

632
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,559
areas that if something has been changed

633
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,559
do you need to you know respond strongly

634
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,400
and how does that response work

635
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,679
your protections need to be highly

636
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:05,880
tunable

637
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,039
um now this is like we mentioned right

638
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,780
at the start of the session

639
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,240
the biggest one that one of the biggest

640
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,220
challenge for Security Solutions in

641
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,960
mobile applications is the impact on the

642
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,340
user experience

643
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,000
so if you just blindly apply security to

644
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,919
these Solutions it's going to have a

645
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,659
negative impact to these YouTube

646
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,000
appearances okay we see all the time you

647
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,159
have applications that double in size

648
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,700
just from graphic security protections

649
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,500
um or you have applications that look

650
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,840
randomly correct because parts of the

651
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,659
code have been incorrectly detected

652
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:40,919
so we need to make sure that these

653
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,900
protections are optimized for not just

654
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,760
the the performance the user but then

655
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,740
also the seismic device

656
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,380
okay and again you know once that

657
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,179
application is released you know are you

658
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,980
getting visibility into it once it's

659
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,840
released you know do you know if

660
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,640
something has gone wrong and then once

661
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
you're approve if something goes wrong

662
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
okay make sure you have a procedure and

663
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,159
a plan behind

664
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
how you handle the outcome of these

665
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,580
protections being put in place

666
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,720
so then the final area that I kind of

667
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,880
want to talk about from you know these

668
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,620
recommendations is runtime protection

669
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,840
itself

670
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,179
so as you start moving to the space it's

671
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,740
more of an evolving space it's certainly

672
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,799
it's a much newer area of protectant

673
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,179
um there's a lot more questions to ask

674
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,919
yourself as well because it's a deeper

675
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,620
area before so you have to ask yourself

676
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,600
how do you monitor your install base

677
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,659
right now to ensure that all these

678
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,039
applications you're releasing are not

679
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,679
using data they're not being abused uh

680
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,840
do you have this ability do you do you

681
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
have the opportunity to do that was it

682
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,900
something that you feel that you could

683
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,740
have

684
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,779
yeah

685
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,760
it's good to release it up quickly you

686
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,059
know how do you see end user data but

687
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,860
then also the device and your brand from

688
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,120
that application running an environment

689
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,340
that may have an hour with a malicious

690
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,419
access point

691
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,940
device compromises elevations all these

692
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,260
kind of different types of practices

693
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,700
here but

694
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,400
um how is your applications

695
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,600
is it aware of it is it going

696
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,820
all questions to ask yourself

697
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,980
as well so obviously

698
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,039
we missed you for a uh second there

699
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,600
Oliver I just was just wondering if you

700
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,940
could repeat the last sentence you broke

701
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,020
up

702
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,960
no worries no worries uh so we just I

703
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,220
was just saying so

704
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,120
um

705
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,100
the malware the touch of malware and

706
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,779
different various exports that have been

707
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,880
developed out there what we need to do

708
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,460
is ensure that the protections that were

709
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,600
put into place in these Solutions are

710
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,220
up-to-date you know they are able to

711
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,039
protect against these new uh pieces of

712
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,020
malware these new exploits the new

713
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,520
fishing attempts all these kind of

714
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,260
different different vectors that we see

715
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,159
out there

716
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,840
how are you going to keep that solution

717
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,659
up to date so that when these new types

718
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,580
of attack emerge you're protected

719
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,960
against them okay it's a really

720
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,960
challenging area to agree so it's a

721
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,260
really important question to be asking

722
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,900
um and you know to address that how do

723
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,820
you do these things without re-releasing

724
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,080
application one of the most costly

725
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,340
things that we could be asking people to

726
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,440
do is redevelop and re-release an

727
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,000
application onto the App Store every

728
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,179
time you need to see how do we see this

729
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,279
without requiring someone to redevelop

730
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,640
uh or you know move things into the

731
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,220
platform just to prioritize security

732
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,080
uh they're all really good questions so

733
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,220
then we're looking for the best practice

734
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,020
behind this

735
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,740
um

736
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,240
some of the things we recommend every

737
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,760
customer to do so look at the threat

738
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,440
modeling before you approached right

739
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,940
okay

740
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,260
um you need to understand you know what

741
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,299
the risk to your application okay so if

742
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,620
you let's say you have a financial

743
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,320
banking solution you need to be able to

744
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,820
protect the transactions the

745
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,120
authentication through uh data of the

746
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,460
user adds a few examples so we need to

747
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,260
then understand what threats that data

748
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,520
could be and then that how is this

749
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,620
Define you know if an attacker is trying

750
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,360
to access those things how they would do

751
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,479
it

752
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,080
um we need to ensure the threat

753
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,179
detection is quite be embedded inside an

754
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,740
application but it's also giving the

755
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,080
visibility most of the application but

756
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,159
also you as a solution provider or a

757
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,140
application management team

758
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,360
uh to that that threat to the threats

759
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,860
and risks that are being seen on the

760
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,360
device okay

761
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,840
um we see we see in monitor threats

762
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,220
across you know device Network

763
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,740
applications and phishing

764
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,059
um you need to make sure that all those

765
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,460
different areas are becoming visible to

766
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,820
the application so that you can

767
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,900
orchestrate the mediations against it

768
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,940
but also you're you're aware of those

769
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,400
things as well okay

770
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,860
um that awareness you need to be feeding

771
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,940
that back into some kind of scene

772
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,679
platform or forward mitigation tools

773
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,659
every application is different every

774
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,460
pollution is different the requirements

775
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,620
behind it are quite often tight

776
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,200
standards as well so as we start looking

777
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,539
into the future of maybe uh PCI

778
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,799
compliance

779
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,740
um the focus is going to be shifting a

780
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,900
lot more around data collection and data

781
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,299
being being able to make use of that

782
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,580
data as part of the solution so that

783
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,340
data needs to be collected and used in a

784
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
useful manner

785
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,600
the response policies need to be

786
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,360
automated so as they no point

787
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,520
collect in this data becoming aware of

788
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,200
these threats if you're not going to be

789
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,539
having automated responses you know the

790
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,299
time it would take someone on a human to

791
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,340
respond to this on an application side

792
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,700
uh is too long if someone is actively

793
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,919
looking into a tampering with an

794
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,020
application to try and steal data that

795
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,659
remediation needs to be automated

796
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,480
I'm ready to go when the threat is

797
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,679
detected okay

798
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,820
Solutions as and as I mentioned before

799
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,260
you know one in one that's key questions

800
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,059
is there's any solution that is

801
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,640
implemented should be able to evolve

802
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,799
without requiring you to really release

803
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,000
your application

804
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,980
uh we don't you know as solution

805
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,320
providers and security

806
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,940
researchers and Company you know we

807
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,399
don't want to be advising people to

808
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,080
approach

809
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,880
to Security in a way that means it's an

810
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,620
overhead for them

811
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,480
um especially from an ongoing release

812
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,980
basis so what we need to be doing is if

813
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,539
you're in the solutions that are being

814
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,520
provided are adaptable and they can

815
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,919
evolve without requiring new releases

816
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,960
and more development time on a long-term

817
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,480
basis okay

818
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,980
so just to kind of wrap up the session

819
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,779
today I just kind of want to give our

820
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,100
perspective on some of the key things

821
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,039
that we should be or you should be

822
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,399
asking uh mobile security vendors

823
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,480
researchers people on the market you

824
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,980
know as you start looking

825
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,080
at addressing these problems okay these

826
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,460
are some of the key things to watch so

827
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,679
if you're looking at Solutions out there

828
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,140
okay you need to be understanding

829
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,380
not just if how those Solutions are

830
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,000
helping you

831
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,220
you know secure yourself against attacks

832
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,320
okay it's you you don't want the binary

833
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,440
yes it does you want to understand the

834
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,640
mechanisms and solutions for features

835
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,100
that are being implemented to ensure

836
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,539
that they're the right mitigations for

837
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,240
you okay we mentioned before about that

838
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,580
whole understanding of your uh

839
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,200
requirements behind the security

840
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,840
approach that needs to match against the

841
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,120
solutions they're being provided

842
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,100
again do you have to update your

843
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,360
application every time you want to

844
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,760
improve the security policy you don't

845
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,840
want to be doing that so you need to

846
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,340
make sure you're not falling into that

847
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,240
track

848
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,620
okay

849
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,779
what happens if the device is not you

850
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,880
know offline so

851
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,980
many applications out there that

852
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,380
designed to be online at the time

853
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,179
um but there's always a risk where you

854
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,299
have cache data on and on in on the

855
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,039
device it goes offline and someone

856
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,260
starts tampering whatever okay it's one

857
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,580
of the things that security researchers

858
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,799
will do especially if it seems like the

859
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,179
applications talk to some kind of

860
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,120
cloud-based service to analyze data

861
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,679
metadata use some kind of machine

862
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,520
learning cloud-based service we need to

863
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,980
ensure that if even if the device is not

864
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,200
connected to the internet the protection

865
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,460
continues

866
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,000
okay

867
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,960
um

868
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,399
the solution should be benefiting you as

869
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,140
well from the solution release

870
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,760
perspective so

871
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,980
it shouldn't be delaying release Cycles

872
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,320
it's the solution should be helping you

873
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,480
accelerate your release Cycles okay so

874
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,220
you need to really you don't ask the

875
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,080
question you know

876
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,940
is this going to stop me from releasing

877
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,860
my application or what's the negative

878
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,020
impact and you want to be looking for a

879
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,580
positive impact on your release cycle

880
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,260
okay these Solutions are designed to

881
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,820
help you I mentioned before about

882
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,559
automated security testing that should

883
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,059
be you know one of the things that

884
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,919
you're using to ensure that your testing

885
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,799
is done early so that you can accelerate

886
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,659
and have confidence when you go to

887
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,700
things like head testing

888
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,860
and also make sure you reach out for

889
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,840
reference with an example okay to make

890
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,700
sure not just have you got a customer

891
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,039
using this solution but how have you

892
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,380
help a customer

893
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,559
um achieve a certain certification for

894
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,419
example okay so how did you make that

895
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,100
customer successful you know that's

896
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,740
really what you want to be looking for

897
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,320
so from that perspective uh and from

898
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,360
that uh comment you know that's that's

899
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,440
everything I wanted to walk through

900
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,659
today it's our perception on what is

901
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,760
happening out there this is real data

902
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,100
real research that we've been doing and

903
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,659
all of these recommendations are all

904
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,820
based on you know customer Journeys

905
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
we've been on and people that we work

906
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,299
with in the industry so thank you very

907
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,779
much for listening

908
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,679
all right uh thank you so much Oliver

909
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,340
for uh this interesting uh session

910
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,960
um shall we see I think we have a few

911
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,760
questions

912
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,200
so

913
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,140
the first question would be

914
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,140
um are there any best practices for

915
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,740
reducing the risk to release Cycles from

916
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,600
failed pen tests

917
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,739
that you could yes mention yeah so a

918
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,260
great question so yes uh as I mentioned

919
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,020
in this session before Phil pentes are

920
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,719
one of the biggest

921
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,300
risk points in releasing an application

922
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,800
you know especially before it's

923
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,139
installed on the device

924
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,599
um so yeah shift left security okay so

925
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,399
make sure your security testing is being

926
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,440
done during development it means you're

927
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
fixing the problems as soon as they're

928
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,639
identified and it means as you go to pen

929
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,560
test there's a lot more confidence in

930
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,619
that cycle uh that you know pen tests

931
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,418
aren't going to be failing the you know

932
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,399
missing obfuscation and things like that

933
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,619
they're going to be failing for at least

934
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,139
a general reason not not something that

935
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,719
could be fixed later on

936
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,719
um

937
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,619
um yes thank you and are there any best

938
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,040
or good approaches to handle application

939
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,800
security improvements in response to new

940
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
threats uh happening every day

941
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,560
yeah so using solutions that can

942
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,960
improve uh maybe they are dynamically

943
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,880
updated or maybe they are using things

944
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,880
like machine learning to not look at

945
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,579
threats based on known dictionaries and

946
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,099
and libraries and crashes where they're

947
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,579
using more of a behavior approach to

948
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:30,359
um

949
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,339
focus more on the behavior changes that

950
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,920
are happening on the device because

951
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,180
Behavior changes are a side effect of

952
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,640
whatever threat is published in so if we

953
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,520
abstract away the behavior from what's

954
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,619
causing the behavior it means that we

955
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,780
can be a lot more intelligent around

956
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,820
being future proven these Solutions

957
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,200
absolutely and the way you mentioned it

958
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,560
that there is new types of there are new

959
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,680
types of malware coming out every every

960
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,220
day if not every hour I mean you really

961
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,980
need to get creative and Innovative as

962
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,740
well in securing the mobile uh the

963
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,420
mobile industry

964
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,520
yeah

965
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,400
and while we are on to that let's say I

966
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,119
am I'm really concerned about the

967
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,660
security posture of the of my app of the

968
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,640
app I'm developing so where where should

969
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,500
I start

970
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,020
yeah so it and that's a very good

971
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,300
question so it depends entirely around

972
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,700
what you're developing uh this is a

973
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,380
conversation that you should definitely

974
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,119
have with security teams the compliance

975
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,680
teams because

976
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,240
um you don't need you don't necessarily

977
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,040
have to have every security solution

978
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,140
Under the Sun if you're doing things

979
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,700
with encryption encryption you should

980
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,839
definitely be focusing on things like

981
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,980
your keys I believe every uh every every

982
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,320
organization every every developer every

983
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,020
uh Team can benefit from regular

984
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,020
security testing so regular testing

985
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,119
Azure developing code anyone could

986
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,099
benefit from uh actually move into

987
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,359
things like as I mentioned encryption

988
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,040
decryption

989
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,200
um that's that can be a bit more bespoke

990
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,260
and based on these demands everyone

991
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,200
needs some kind of Statute protection uh

992
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,240
you know there's there's never a case

993
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,560
that you can argue that you don't need

994
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,540
any stats

995
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,400
um because otherwise you're just leaving

996
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,560
yourself open for me packaging attacks

997
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,060
or

998
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,119
projecting code into your application

999
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,400
and the dynamic approach that is very

1000
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,260
much an evolving area it's definitely

1001
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,520
something that people should look into

1002
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,800
around what the runtime threats are to

1003
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,260
their application uh and then also how

1004
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,020
they would you know mitigate those you

1005
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,839
know if they were to occur

1006
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,520
yeah

1007
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,980
uh thanks and uh that's that's one thing

1008
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,839
when I'm the one that is developing an

1009
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,599
application or when I'm a very familiar

1010
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,820
with uh with kind of a tea and maybe

1011
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,099
information security but what what if I

1012
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,119
am an unexperienced user and even an

1013
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,079
employee of of a company so and how do I

1014
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,660
know that are there any recommendations

1015
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,060
on how I can know if this application is

1016
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,099
safe that I want to download or that I

1017
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,320
want to use are there any like main

1018
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,020
pinpoints I can be on the lookout for

1019
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,540
to kind of say hey this this sounds this

1020
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,220
looks shady I shouldn't I shouldn't

1021
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,160
probably download that yeah so I mean

1022
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,800
yeah there's always

1023
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,119
as someone that spends all the time in

1024
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,440
the interview has always sort of you

1025
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,640
know obvious things out there you know

1026
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,960
three applications that are supposed to

1027
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,780
be offering you uh premium features and

1028
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,760
things like that um things that are

1029
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,040
making a package having Solutions

1030
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,680
available to you to test for those kind

1031
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,660
of things is always good

1032
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,980
um you know being able to scan an

1033
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,300
application being able to analyze an

1034
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,500
application

1035
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,119
I think the biggest

1036
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,460
problem that anyone that owns and

1037
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,839
develops an application will have is

1038
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,060
what if those applications installed

1039
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,859
alongside your application as well

1040
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,960
what's the impact as well so definitely

1041
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,060
being able to be aware of the presence

1042
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,160
of those applications alongside your

1043
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,020
application that's another really key

1044
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,259
area

1045
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,800
yeah

1046
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,500
yes and

1047
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,440
um from from your your experience since

1048
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,920
you have been communicating with many

1049
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,380
customers like are there any any

1050
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,599
interesting uh like scary

1051
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,260
vulnerabilities you have seen and kind

1052
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,119
of what what has the consequence of

1053
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,800
those of those being do you have like

1054
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,500
your own real life stories

1055
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,140
right

1056
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,480
yeah we we were a lot of organizations

1057
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,119
and uh some have been hacked some

1058
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,119
haven't so there's some companies who

1059
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,800
worked with who have had ransomware

1060
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,900
attacks they've nearly lost all of their

1061
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,700
companies that it's a

1062
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,339
um we've got some customers yeah and you

1063
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,680
know like one of them they they lost all

1064
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,839
their data and they only managed to

1065
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,579
survive because they have one server

1066
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,980
blade out that had a copy of all of

1067
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,500
their active directory Etc and allowed

1068
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,119
to get that advice so since then they've

1069
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,619
been very nervous but from an

1070
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,000
application perspective there's always

1071
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,440
risks

1072
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,900
you know people may be aware of things

1073
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,420
like uh Checkmate vulnerabilities for

1074
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,300
iOS so there's Hardware vulnerabilities

1075
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,660
on older iPhone devices which are still

1076
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,880
supported by Apple so iPhone 8 is an

1077
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,280
example iPhone x

1078
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,200
um they have a hardware vulnerability in

1079
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,180
them which can mean that anyone can get

1080
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,220
elevation privileged on them and it's

1081
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,480
unpatchable

1082
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,980
so that effectively means if you're

1083
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,820
deploying an a solution to iPhone

1084
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,440
you're going to be coming across like

1085
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,180
okay you can't exclude those devices

1086
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,640
from your deployment so you have to be

1087
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,280
you know conscious that your deployment

1088
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,900
devices that will be vulnerable okay

1089
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,000
these devices will have the capability

1090
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,280
to be 3D exploited

1091
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,380
um you just need to be you know aware of

1092
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,900
that and be prepared to make sure

1093
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,859
hmm yeah that sounds really scary uh I

1094
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,720
mean the consequences can be really huge

1095
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,060
and and the way the way I feel it maybe

1096
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,339
for a at least for a regular User it's

1097
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,980
harder to identify if something is

1098
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,359
potentially vulnerable when you're

1099
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,060
accessing it from Mobile at least like

1100
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,520
on the on the PC on the laptop you have

1101
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,579
like more built-in tools easier at least

1102
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,859
to look into the phishing emails easier

1103
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:23,220
to identify those links are vulnerable

1104
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,680
but it might not be that straightforward

1105
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,540
doing that from the mobile phone and you

1106
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,440
need to be really like aware of that

1107
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,240
I just remember from my own experience

1108
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,640
like we we have this built-in

1109
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,280
application that kind of sends you this

1110
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,500
training phishing emails that you can

1111
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,780
like report and then you can get points

1112
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,119
and train yourself on it and once I

1113
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,460
checked it from my mobile phone and I

1114
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,760
was actually once really

1115
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,040
caught caught by that so uh it looked

1116
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,260
really familiar and I couldn't check the

1117
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,420
link and I open open this Excel sheet

1118
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,820
that looked like reporting and you know

1119
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,880
then it said hey you you kind of uh you

1120
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,680
got caught here that was that could have

1121
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,960
been efficient email so I mean this is

1122
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,240
this is much harder I feel at least when

1123
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,480
it comes to mobile security than a

1124
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,280
regular web application

1125
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,520
yeah that mobile devices are designed to

1126
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,339
be a lot more user friendly so it's

1127
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,140
actually a lot easier for an attacker to

1128
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,020
make a web page look like the webpage of

1129
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,180
another company make an email look like

1130
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,480
it's from from Amazon's example I'll

1131
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,220
send you an SMS message that looks like

1132
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,099
it's from you know your bank it is

1133
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,859
actually a lot easier to fish and spoof

1134
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,480
those kind of things on a mobile device

1135
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,880
then it is a traditional you know

1136
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,220
desktop laptop environment

1137
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,520
yeah yeah absolutely and

1138
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,820
um like yeah we talked about the uh the

1139
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,160
applications themselves but are there

1140
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,599
any any settings uh in in the mobile in

1141
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,940
iOS or in Android like that would be

1142
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,520
really good to ensure that you have them

1143
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,500
that you have them turned on anything

1144
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,380
you could recommend to also be proactive

1145
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,300
on making it more secure to use your

1146
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,140
phone

1147
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,099
yeah so I mean if you're a standard user

1148
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,859
you've got a iOS device uh the best

1149
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,200
thing you can do is keep it patched

1150
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,940
um it's the same for any device you know

1151
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,500
you don't delay patch and there's no

1152
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,140
reason to delay your updates but if you

1153
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,359
look at the security content behind

1154
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,640
every single iOS release so Apple

1155
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Apple's a very good marketing company

1156
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,280
um and if you look at every single iOS

1157
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,859
release they just missed on the cover

1158
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:40,859
the new features or bug fixes and then

1159
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,480
there's a little link down the bottom

1160
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,859
that says click here for the security

1161
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,319
content of this update when you click on

1162
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,800
that security content update it has a

1163
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,619
lot and lots of cves being patched now

1164
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:53,640
they don't put that on the front cover

1165
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,619
you have to go and look for that but

1166
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:56,819
every single release that app was

1167
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:59,339
putting out are addressing at least some

1168
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,560
you know nearly always you know some

1169
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,380
very high CV numbers

1170
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,599
um every release and they just don't put

1171
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,819
in front cover you know Google Android

1172
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,920
it's a little bit more transparent but

1173
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,099
there's there's no difference in in you

1174
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,599
know what there's no reason you should

1175
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,760
delay these updates okay

1176
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
um I I don't see any valid reason to do

1177
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,780
that anymore

1178
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,520
things like Android

1179
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,680
it's a lot more open so you've got a lot

1180
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,660
more access to your options so simple

1181
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,220
things like you know don't enable

1182
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,780
developer options unless you have to

1183
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,880
don't enable you to be debugging unless

1184
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,460
you have to these things yes they're

1185
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,579
great for side loading uh apks you know

1186
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,440
free applications but they actually

1187
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,420
create a massive security hole on that

1188
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,180
device as well so just from the standard

1189
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,520
using perspective just ensure your

1190
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,319
device is not misconfigured

1191
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,579
um when we work with our Enterprise

1192
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:53,579
customers we that's the biggest risk of

1193
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,560
their organizations that we see we see

1194
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,480
we do see jailbreaking devices we see

1195
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,359
customers using our solution and seeing

1196
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:01,980
the security like even in the security

1197
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,480
industry if I have jailbreaking devices

1198
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,920
and they don't know they've got them

1199
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,760
until

1200
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
uh well they don't they they pretend

1201
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,119
they didn't know they were jail person

1202
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,920
but yes only when they installed

1203
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,660
solutions to the technical things you

1204
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,000
see it but it's the biggest risk to a

1205
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,800
lot of Enterprises as well is these

1206
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,480
unpacked um bigger devices

1207
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,920
and probably not attempt to jailbreak

1208
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,700
your device uh or at least acquire a

1209
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,220
jailbreak device either

1210
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,099
yeah yeah it's always it's always tricky

1211
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,260
to say don't try and open you know make

1212
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,359
your device more open to you but

1213
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,760
you are effectively rooting your device

1214
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,339
in order to do that and by reaching your

1215
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,200
device you you do create a massive

1216
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,800
security hole on that device as well

1217
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,460
absolutely that's a very very good point

1218
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,880
um yes I think we we are getting to the

1219
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,900
end of our questions but one last one a

1220
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,579
more General one are there any other

1221
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:01,680
upcoming events or conferences where

1222
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,359
