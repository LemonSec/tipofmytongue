1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,460
um or anyone that has joined us I'm just

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,760
about to introduce the next speaker and

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,440
before that I'll just give myself a

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,240
quick introduction again for anybody new

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,359
here so I'm Denise mirthadone a

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,880
volunteer in the OAS community and also

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,699
the OAS Dublin chapter lead and I will

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,400
be moderating this session so during the

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
next 45 minutes you will be hearing from

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,098
Dr Matthias madhu who's going to present

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,520
to us on quantifiable quality the new

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
standard of secure code

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,980
um there will be some interaction in

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,960
this and I will let me Chase tell you

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,059
how to do that but we will be directing

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,520
you towards the comment section for any

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,579
questions that you may have please feel

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,239
free to add questions to the Q a

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,480
section which is in the right of the

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,539
Huber of the Hoover app and I will ask

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,219
these questions in the last 10 minutes

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,840
we're actually going to leave 10 minutes

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,880
at the end for questions

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
um so I'm gonna get ready to introduce

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,700
you now to my face I can see he's come

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,340
online so Matthias is not only an

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,619
industry recognized security expert with

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,020
a PhD in static analysis but it's the

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,659
CTO and co-founder of the secure code

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,540
Warrior secure code Warrior aims to

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,520
educate developers both new and

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,740
experienced on how to develop secure

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,619
code Mateus is also a regular on the

34
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,600
conference circus speak and AD

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
conferences such as black hat and Defcon

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,579
so with that I'm going to hand it over

37
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,920
to my Chase and I hope you enjoy the

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,560
next talk

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,020
thank you so much I hope you can hear me

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,579
well

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,579
um so yes and absolutely Jeremy is a

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,460
legend I can only attest to that

43
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,619
um so welcome to the conference thanks

44
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,500
for having me here um I would like to do

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,420
it and try something out today I would

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,340
like to make the session interactive and

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,560
use essentially the solution that was

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,860
provided the Hoover

49
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,959
application now it would be great if if

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,140
people can open up the the app and go to

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,819
the comment section because during this

52
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,239
talk I would like to ask some questions

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,520
um and I would love to have some answers

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,860
before I go into hey what I found in the

55
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,060
research

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,700
but first before we even start I have a

57
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,040
question for the audience have you ever

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,160
ever eaten something that was unhealthy

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,900
and you don't have to drop it into the

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,060
comments over here in the in the app but

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,860
I'm pretty confident that I know the

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,260
answer the answer is yes right pretty

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,300
much everybody will say well you know

64
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,860
what I've eaten something that was

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,080
unhealthy which is quite interesting

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,420
right you you know that something isn't

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,640
healthy and still you continue and you

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,640
say you know what for once it's okay

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,160
so interestingly enough that's where

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
knowledge and behavior doesn't really

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,940
line up you know the knowledge you have

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,140
the knowledge you know that it's

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,360
something and is unhealthy

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,340
still your behavior is different your

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,080
behaviors you know what for this one

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,660
time it it will not matter you know

77
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,180
we're okay it's fun you know we can

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,459
still do it all right if that goes

79
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,220
really out of balance well you may have

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,620
some problems and that's why you know a

81
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,260
successful dietary programs they work

82
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,120
both on the knowledge and the behavior

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,519
because quite often the knowledge is

84
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,440
simply there the knowledge is simply

85
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,080
there it is not in the in those programs

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,959
it's not telling people what healthy and

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,640
unhealthy is but it's more working on

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,580
the behavior and and trying to figure

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,640
out why this Behavior really exists does

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,159
it have some underlying cause

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,620
um and also trying to influence that

92
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,080
behavior so trying to influence that

93
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,319
behavior with for example gamification a

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,019
pointing system put pointing people in

95
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,120
the right direction of trying to do the

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
right thing and living healthy

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,280
so knowledge and behavior they need to

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,540
line up

99
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,299
my next question have you ever shipped

100
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,019
software you knew had a problem okay you

101
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,959
can start dropping answers in um in the

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,180
comment section of the Rover app

103
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,918
um I can promise you your manager is not

104
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,978
looking but that would be a lie so I

105
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,720
know unfortunately I know I know the

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,759
answer as well right

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,380
um there's a lot of people that say yes

108
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,020
I've shipped software that I knew it had

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,240
a problem I knew it so again the

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
knowledge is there you knew it had a

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,199
problem however from a behavior

112
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,060
perspective you said well

113
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,160
I had to do something I had to reach a

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,960
deadline it must be in production by

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,580
today and so on and so forth so your

116
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,400
behavior was or it was not a big problem

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,259
um so there may be lots of reasons again

118
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,300
knowledge and behavior they do not line

119
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,540
up and ultimately you create some habits

120
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,520
um and and this is what I would like to

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,259
address in this talk in this talk I

122
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,520
would like to go a little bit through

123
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,680
knowledge and behavior from a developer

124
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,259
perspective and figure out how we are

125
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,479
actually creating code today and how we

126
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,460
can potentially work on the knowledge

127
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,139
and work on the behavior to create

128
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,000
better codes

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
so thank you very much for having me

130
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,080
over here my name is Matthias madhu I'm

131
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,759
the CTO and co-founder of secure code

132
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,820
Warrior maybe relevant for Relevant for

133
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,740
this discussion is

134
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,259
um back in the day um I used to work on

135
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,419
on static analysis Solutions so I have a

136
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,000
PhD in application security where

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
um uh my main goal was to use static

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
analysis to find interesting things in

139
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,139
the code with my PhD I moved to the US

140
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,479
joined the company called fortify and

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,100
they were really good at finding

142
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,320
problems in codes

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,580
um however and that's that's where the

144
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,860
whole thing comes together right if you

145
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,199
never ever tell a developer how to write

146
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,060
code so the knowledge part over here

147
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,460
well it's it's not gonna happen so with

148
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,560
that knowledge we we created secure code

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,380
Warrior to help and actually educate the

150
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,440
developer and be on his or her side in

151
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,479
writing secured codes

152
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,580
um again lately I started to discover

153
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,440
well even if the knowledge is there like

154
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,360
how can we then still influence the

155
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
behavior because it takes two parts it

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
takes two parts and that's that's why

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm here to talk about this this topic

158
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,680
today

159
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,180
now I really would like to try out the

160
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,740
app and I really hope that people will

161
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,780
join me and and put some thoughts around

162
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,120
these questions that I'm proposing so

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,979
what do we need to build software okay

164
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,919
so I I from back in the day I know when

165
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,440
at the OAS conferences we we have a lot

166
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
of applications security people but we

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,220
also have a lot of developers that have

168
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,960
an interest in security joining the

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,060
conference so it would be really really

170
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,759
good to know like hey what what do you

171
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,860
think like if I say hey what do we need

172
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,000
to build

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,380
um software I'm not saying secure

174
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,539
software I'm just saying softer what do

175
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,560
you need

176
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,180
now I'll give it a couple minutes for

177
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,100
people to open up the app and drop some

178
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,759
thoughts in there

179
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,620
and I really hope this works out because

180
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,660
my entire presentation I will ask more

181
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,280
of these questions and if I'm not

182
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,979
getting any feedback this is going to be

183
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,419
hard for me so please make it easy

184
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,699
please go to that comment section and

185
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,220
please drop some comments in the app

186
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,780
and I hope I can actually see them I

187
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,720
should be able to see them I

188
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,819
requirements thank you

189
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,919
Zao for putting one thing in there we

190
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,479
have requirements what else do we need

191
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,880
to build software

192
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,719
foreign

193
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,259
tools I love it Hardware I love it

194
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,500
Stefan thank you jeremius a software

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,860
platform

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,900
I need one more come on what else do we

197
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,859
need to build software

198
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,259
an environment

199
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,539
thank you Marco runtime thank you Jeremy

200
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,300
jeremius third party libraries yeah I

201
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,979
said softer right I didn't say secure

202
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,740
software developers thank you Zao

203
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,960
exactly right I'm I'm super pleased to

204
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,259
have seen that answer so we if we build

205
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,539
software and all fits into those

206
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,120
categories we need people and we need

207
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,699
stuff and one thing that is always very

208
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,759
clear to me is if I ask this question

209
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,000
and I'm super pleased to see that Zao

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,620
thought about the developers but quite

211
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,479
often we forget about the developers we

212
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,460
we forget about there needs to be people

213
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,560
that actually build this stuff

214
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
and then um in interactions with

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,640
um uh people around the world I feel the

216
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,919
exact same thing like in conversations

217
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,799
it it's always about the stuff it's

218
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
always about IDE tools a lot of these

219
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,060
things it's not bad don't get me wrong

220
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,560
we need to talk about the stuff because

221
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,019
ultimately we put bits and buys into

222
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,600
production but it's not quite often

223
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,399
about the people

224
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm at the RSA conference right now and

225
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
Industry wise if you walk around on the

226
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
show floor you have the exact same

227
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,440
feeling 95 of the the companies out

228
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,300
there talk about the stuff they talk

229
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,880
about the tools everything around and

230
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
building software but not really about

231
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
people

232
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,700
do we really need to focus on people and

233
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,560
and why and I'm not going to ask that

234
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,200
question over here but what is the

235
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,820
easiest solution if we do not want to

236
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,320
have you know if you do not want to

237
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,080
focus on people and unfortunately that

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,720
is not having the people at all and I do

239
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,220
want to say that I do want to say that

240
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,060
because

241
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,920
um there are still companies that do not

242
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,680
invest in in the people and back in the

243
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,260
day in the 1990s I I thought that was a

244
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,580
pretty interesting story there was a

245
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,320
Belgian company that was doing really

246
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,720
good with software development and

247
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
helping other organizations essentially

248
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,380
Outsourcing their developers and

249
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,839
creating more software for

250
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,140
um the companies in Belgium they doing

251
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,480
really well however in the 1990s they

252
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,240
said you know what we think we predict

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,420
by the year 2000 software development

254
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,519
will no longer be a thing everything

255
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,040
will be developed by that time and it

256
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,260
will just be you know drop and drag and

257
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,540
drag and drop and and that's going to be

258
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,580
it so they weren't really convinced that

259
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,200
that people were still going to drive

260
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,959
softer robots machines AI everything was

261
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,399
going to take over

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
you can see that one happening right

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,779
um right now that company is no longer a

264
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,660
a big organization and they fail to miss

265
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,060
that point the one thing I would like to

266
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,580
get across over here is you know it's

267
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,080
it's not easy it's not trivial there's

268
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,600
no Silver Bullet in creating secure

269
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,640
software but we see definitely the

270
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,220
people as the number one investment

271
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,019
point in your organization where you can

272
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,399
say well you know what if we invest in

273
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,740
our people that's going to drive it

274
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,459
foreign

275
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,200
I was trying to figure out how much how

276
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,420
much do we know about the people that

277
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,820
are creating softer you know and and I

278
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,000
was digging into some research and

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,420
um a similar thing arose where I figured

280
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,060
out that 95 of the studies that I was

281
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,459
looking into on how to create secure

282
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,519
software was around its stuff the tools

283
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,860
the technology everything that has to do

284
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,779
with the bits and the bytes

285
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,820
five percent and I'm calling this

286
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,040
unknown territory it's not entirely true

287
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,320
five percent it's it's percentage-wise

288
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,800
over here but a very minor fraction of

289
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,079
all the research out there is

290
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,120
um around the people and the research

291
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,760
out there I think is is pretty much

292
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,680
unknown like a lot of people do know do

293
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,480
not know about the research stuff that I

294
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,700
figured out I was actually it was for me

295
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,320
it was mind-blowing and that's

296
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,640
essentially what I would like to do over

297
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,320
here so we've done some research

298
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,560
ourselves I've um uh found some research

299
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,660
online some pretty interesting research

300
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,820
around

301
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,140
knowledge and behavior that I would like

302
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,380
to present

303
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,820
my next question was you know what is

304
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,279
that the same in in other Industries if

305
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,940
we think about the people are are we you

306
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,160
know unique are we the same as another

307
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
industry where the focus is really on

308
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,779
the end solution and the the way I try

309
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,940
to answer that question is I was looking

310
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,040
at certification because I know in our

311
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,540
field there's there's not a lot of

312
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,579
certification going on

313
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,980
um essentially when you come out of uni

314
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,380
and you join an organization well you

315
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,300
are given a laptop you're given access

316
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,660
to the repo and you can start coding

317
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,180
in other Industries it seems to be way

318
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,920
more regulated if you look at

319
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,860
certification for doctors operating

320
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,380
airplanes building airplanes engineering

321
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,660
the grid a lot has to do with

322
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,519
certification for the people for the

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,980
tools for the processing processes so

324
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,680
it's not only for for this for for what

325
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,120
they do but also for the people

326
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,740
themselves

327
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,720
interestingly enough when I when I

328
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,579
created a slide I was like geez that's

329
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,519
pretty interesting right because slowly

330
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,339
but steadily software came into all of

331
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,160
these areas and slowly but steadily it

332
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
actually became the heart of all of

333
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,320
these new areas it became the heart of

334
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,720
the grid it became the heart of of gas

335
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,639
pipelines traffic controls cars

336
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,220
hospitals everything everything became

337
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,860
softer right and it's to me it's

338
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,360
actually mind-blowing that you have

339
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,220
these highly regulated Industries where

340
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,079
certif cert you need to have a lot of

341
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,060
certifications and slowly but steadily

342
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,920
you know some unregulated thing like

343
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,680
software comes into play and you know

344
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,800
the Boom is there on the slide and and

345
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,139
to to go a little bit deeper on a real

346
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,680
example over here if you think about a

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,540
pipeline you know you think about a

348
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,200
pipeline 20 30 40 years ago it is it is

349
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,720
a pipe where you open manually Valves

350
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
and stuff flows liquid stuffs from from

351
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,660
one place to another one that has

352
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,300
changed dramatically right from being a

353
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,579
whole manual building process to a whole

354
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,940
manual operating process today gas

355
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,980
pipelines all these valves open and

356
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,980
close in an automatic fashion and and

357
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,839
it's all driven by software it's all

358
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,079
driven by software and maybe 10 years

359
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,360
ago 20 years ago it was not connected to

360
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,480
the internet but today it clearly is the

361
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,579
colonial pipeline attack is is one of

362
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,279
the most noticeable examples over here

363
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,380
where something that was completely

364
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,019
manual completely operated by people not

365
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,360
by software became today completely

366
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
operated by the Machine by the software

367
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
and what happened over there is so the

368
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,500
colonial pipeline it goes from the south

369
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,880
of the US and it distributes jet fuel to

370
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,980
the east coast of the US well what

371
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,320
happened over there is two days before

372
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,540
the actual attack they are they already

373
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,220
breached and already data was

374
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,139
exfiltrated

375
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,940
um but then they were actually hacked

376
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,800
with some ransomware as well they did

377
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,880
pay

378
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,000
um uh their Ransom it only took a long

379
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,040
long time to decrypt all the machines

380
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,800
and to be operational one of the

381
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,720
problems in there is is you know SQL

382
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,639
injection it's not the only problem in

383
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,459
there it was a collection of unpatched

384
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,980
systems and and unpatched problems that

385
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,240
led to this particular problem

386
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,399
but this is only to say you know this is

387
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,139
how we built software right like we're

388
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,240
we're and I'm sure it was well intended

389
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,579
like the colonial pipeline

390
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,279
um software slowly was steadily creeped

391
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,980
in to uh the operation of that

392
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,019
particular pipeline But ultimately it

393
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,000
was then connected to the world it was

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,380
not made to be connected to the world

395
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,060
and there's a lot of systems that today

396
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,220
were not made to be connected to the

397
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,180
world

398
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,180
and that's actually how how quite often

399
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,220
people you know see their own code

400
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,779
they're like well but it's only a little

401
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,339
piece of software it's not going to be

402
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,440
connected to the internet so you know

403
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,180
quick and dirty I'm gonna hack this

404
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,100
thing together and and it's gonna do

405
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,240
what it has to do it's something

406
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,860
internal

407
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,480
um it will not be connected to the

408
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,940
internet and you would be surprised how

409
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,639
quickly it actually is taken and be

410
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
exposed to the internet or bits and

411
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
pieces are taken and be exposed to the

412
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,839
internet

413
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,420
all right let's dive a little bit into

414
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,880
the research and um

415
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,540
again oh so let's let's talk about the

416
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,920
developer I'm sorry let's talk about the

417
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,600
developer so what I would like to do

418
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,220
over here we have knowledge we have

419
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,680
behavior and that leads to habits you

420
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
know if you put knowledge and behavior

421
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,820
together it leads to habits that a

422
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,339
person can act on okay so as you can see

423
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,019
over here what I'm interested in is is

424
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,639
in that middle section

425
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,440
um what do we know about the knowledge

426
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,480
what do we know about the behavior and

427
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,759
can we influence that or can we at least

428
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,040
take that into consideration so it

429
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,720
actually leads to better habits so that

430
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,459
the person can act on that in a better

431
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,660
way

432
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,300
but people on the call will be well I

433
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,040
know you did some surveys but I'm a

434
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
developer as well why do you not ask me

435
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,699
and that's exactly what I'm going to do

436
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,740
so what I would like to do I'm gonna I'm

437
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,660
gonna pose a question I would love to

438
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,339
see some answers again on the comment

439
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,439
section in in the app and then I'm

440
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,839
actually going to to talk about my own

441
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,119
experience how I would act and or How

442
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,099
would how I would answer that particular

443
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,140
question and then I would like to go

444
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,500
through the results of the survey

445
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,140
let's go to the first question what is

446
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,179
your top priority when writing codes

447
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,380
so please drop some answers into the

448
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,940
wavu app

449
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,100
what is your top priority when you write

450
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,399
code

451
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,380
requirements be clear about the

452
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,020
requirements understand what the code is

453
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,880
doing

454
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
thank you Marco thank you Zao

455
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,580
tests yep

456
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,559
we're all very biased over here right

457
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,660
because we we are on the space of

458
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,559
writing secure codes

459
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,179
clean codes

460
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,100
nice on Stefan data flow

461
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,700
the tag vectors again

462
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,340
thank you NICU it's not I'll be honest

463
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,919
when I do this presentation

464
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,200
um for a developer crew these are not my

465
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,179
typical answers

466
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,039
but they're good answers don't get me

467
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,780
wrong they're really good answers but

468
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,059
when developers when I ask this question

469
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,820
to developers attack vectors is the

470
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,700
first time I see attack vectors

471
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
this is my answer my answer would be

472
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,260
writing new features and functionality

473
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,660
if I would you know I used to be a

474
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,640
developer but if I would be a developer

475
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,240
I I would not you know even even I like

476
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,299
the the tests over here Jeremiah's that

477
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,799
you answered but it would not be my top

478
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,179
priority I would not immediately think

479
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,640
about uh tests for me I would think

480
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,500
about new features and functionality and

481
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,640
unfortunately I would not think about

482
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,340
tests I should be

483
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,880
um

484
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,039
if you look at the survey and this is a

485
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,280
survey uh from from 1200 developers so

486
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
1200 developers

487
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,059
um responded to this particular question

488
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,520
and we were able to group then the

489
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,640
answers in in buckets over here

490
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,100
the top priority

491
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,200
excuse me the top priority

492
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,460
twice 19 was about code quality reducing

493
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,919
technical debt application performance

494
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,340
to me that sounds like rework and I

495
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,440
think that's pretty interesting like if

496
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
if you look at my answer I I would like

497
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,360
to work on features and functionality I

498
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,280
would say my answers like an answer when

499
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,340
you come out of University when you you

500
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,260
know you want to be a developer you want

501
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,760
to land your dream job you want to

502
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,740
create new features new functionality

503
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,000
you know new stuff I would you know I

504
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
think people would be I think

505
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,120
disappointed when they come out of

506
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,200
University and they say you know what

507
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
all I want to do is rework you know

508
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,100
that's that's not and and still I think

509
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,260
this this group of people

510
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,960
um it it is new developers but also

511
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,179
seasoned developers well quite a lot of

512
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,940
them their top priority is making sure

513
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
that the code is behaving better there's

514
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,900
there's already code but they want to do

515
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,919
it better

516
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,900
so ultimately that also means that it

517
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,580
wasn't really you know and I know it's

518
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,960
an iterative process but it wasn't

519
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,080
really properly developed from the start

520
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,960
more on on the right hand side number

521
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
three and number five that's where I

522
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,960
really see new work where I really see

523
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,240
new work like solving real problems

524
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,740
um new features and functionality I

525
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,539
think that's really what what the dream

526
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,980
job is right if you come out of

527
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,440
University if you if you have an ideal

528
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,919
scenario of what a software developer is

529
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,600
then I think you land in the in the

530
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,419
three and the five

531
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,980
interestingly enough and this is this is

532
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,380
actually pretty big in in the in the

533
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,120
responses from this particular group

534
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,940
well it ranks application security

535
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,799
people said you know what for us it's

536
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,419
it's creating secure code that is our

537
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,280
top priority

538
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,559
but that also raises a question

539
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,900
um for me like well if if they say

540
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,460
appsec

541
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,700
what practices do you you know associate

542
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,020
with secure coding and I'm pretty

543
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,299
confident I will see a lot of answers

544
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,000
over here so in this particular group of

545
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,520
people what do you associate with secure

546
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,000
coding

547
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,700
thank you

548
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,360
code review love it Marco goat smell oh

549
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,520
no the kill

550
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,280
code review code smell what else so what

551
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
practices do we associate with secure

552
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
coding

553
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,400
come on we're in this absent group we

554
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,159
need to have more answers and then test

555
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,860
cases great automatic security test dust

556
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,720
SAS The Usual Suspects thank you very

557
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,520
much Jeremiahs I'm happy that somebody

558
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,080
points out the obvious in this

559
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,678
particular group

560
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:11,100
any more things we have code review a

561
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,900
code smell you have test cases we have

562
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,820
automated security tests so what

563
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,280
practices do you associate with secure

564
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,760
coding

565
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,960
threat modeling nice one Andre

566
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,679
weird weird Corner boundary cases nikhil

567
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,100
great

568
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,600
and I and I know where these answers are

569
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,539
coming from training for secure mindset

570
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,580
thank you Zao

571
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,380
and already these answers are coming

572
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,880
from because we're we're in this

573
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,559
abstract business right and we're we're

574
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,960
thinking about security and it's very

575
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,299
interesting so when when

576
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,980
I had to think about this one because

577
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll be honest my initial answers would

578
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,179
be very along the lines of of what's

579
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,460
over here but when I thought about it

580
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,020
for a second time what I what what

581
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,659
practices I associate with secure coding

582
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,480
zero trust thank you nikhil

583
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,600
when I thought about it I was like well

584
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
I can see that I can see what we need to

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,220
do but if you're in the shoes of a

586
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,080
developer I think it is the act of

587
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,940
writing secure code with known secure

588
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,580
coding patterns

589
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,559
our company is trying to build secure

590
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,539
culture for developers I love it right

591
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,980
so

592
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,159
um the act of writing code using um

593
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,960
known secure coding patterns I'll be

594
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,120
honest this is not my first answer

595
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,280
um I had to you know and and people on

596
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,740
on on on this call do not have the time

597
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,260
to to think for 10 minutes about my my

598
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,900
question over here but when I sat back

599
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,580
and I was really trying to figure out

600
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,980
what I associate with secure coding I

601
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,440
was thinking about you know doing the

602
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,200
act of doing it and and and using the

603
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,179
secure coding patterns

604
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,340
when we write a group of developers when

605
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,799
you ask the group of developers I'll be

606
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,840
honest we had a lot of different answers

607
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,179
and this is this is only the top you

608
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,740
know we had a lot of different answers

609
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,020
but let's I try to group them a little

610
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,179
bit so what's in there if I if I think

611
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,640
about my answer you know the act of

612
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,400
writing code and and the act of using

613
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,320
secure components

614
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,600
um that came not as a top but somewhat

615
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,460
in the middle okay so someone in the

616
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,559
middle the developers themselves thought

617
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,900
about of the act of writing secure code

618
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,059
which I thought would be really you know

619
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,960
higher if you ask developers themselves

620
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,960
interesting enough 22 said yeah you know

621
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,880
what it's not my problem there's this

622
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,440
group of absec people in our

623
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,539
organization it's in their title they

624
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,520
are application security well probably

625
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,260
they should take care of my code you

626
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,080
know I'm a developer my my you know I

627
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,460
need to create features and function

628
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,400
it's not my job to create secure code we

629
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,140
have this group of people they are

630
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,360
responsible

631
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,380
and then you know I think um pretty much

632
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,320
all the questions are all the answers

633
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,880
over here maybe one more is coming

634
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,740
security is everyone's responsibility

635
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,720
including developers love it nikhil I

636
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,480
couldn't agree more and a lot a lot of

637
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
developers were also thinking about you

638
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,620
know Finding problems in code if you can

639
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,440
see over here number one two five seven

640
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,559
and nine it's all about SAS dust

641
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,900
scrutinizing peer code review I've seen

642
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,820
that in the chat as well

643
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,500
um it's it's a lot about you know a

644
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,360
little bit more after the fact so if you

645
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,520
think about the secure coding the act

646
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,460
itself it is the writing itself this is

647
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,900
more you know a little bit after the

648
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,820
fact yes I know people want to bring

649
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,100
that more in line with the development

650
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,200
life cycle itself and give some feedback

651
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,659
while you're writing code but it's still

652
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,760
you know defining problems in code and

653
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,600
giving the feedback

654
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,299
and on number four and I saw that in the

655
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,400
chat as well so thank you very much it's

656
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,440
thinking about the people it's thinking

657
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,140
about you know investing in the People

658
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,779
by the way I'm and I'm not sure if I 100

659
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,039
agree that you know it should be the

660
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,320
number one over here um I I think the

661
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,820
number one is is really the act of

662
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,440
writing code but it does make sense to

663
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,720
also do something before they write code

664
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,240
where ongoing training education

665
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,100
awareness making sure they have they

666
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,380
know about secure Concepts well and that

667
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,380
that isn't baked in

668
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,020
um with the developer and he or she is

669
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,720
able uh to ultimately then act on the

670
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,240
information that that game his or her

671
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,980
way

672
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,159
foreign

673
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,500
what's the conclusion here I think the

674
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,320
conclusion that we draw from all the

675
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,900
different answers is

676
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,760
that there's like no standard definition

677
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,580
of of what secure coding really is we

678
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,559
feel that developers are maybe a little

679
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,960
bit confused what secure coding is from

680
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,059
you know it's not my problem to well

681
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,520
it's it's a tooling problem to well we

682
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,279
need to do training and and and and a

683
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,080
group of people said yes it is you know

684
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,240
when we're actually writing codes which

685
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,340
is which is I think problematic

686
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,179
um

687
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,220
and there's no right answer over here

688
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,960
that that's even more problematic what

689
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,480
what does it really mean secure coding

690
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,460
but making that clear in an organization

691
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,679
will come a long way if you make it

692
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,360
clear in your own organization of what

693
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,860
secure coding means within your

694
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,539
organization I think you will come a

695
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,000
long way

696
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,679
next question and I over here I think

697
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,179
well there's going to be very little

698
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,159
bosses this is not a presentation for an

699
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,440
organization so do you think that you

700
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,820
leave vulnerabilities in your code

701
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,559
and you can answer that question if you

702
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,140
want we can just figure out what

703
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,480
percentage-wise would would say yes and

704
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,539
no over here from this group of people

705
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,279
for sure

706
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,000
yes

707
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
even with a group of

708
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,059
security-minded people I see a lot of

709
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:54,500
yeses one two three four

710
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,360
well maybe people that say no in our

711
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,760
survey lied I don't know but you know my

712
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,159
answer and I'll also have a

713
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,740
defensiveness in my answer over here do

714
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,440
I leave vulnerabilities in my code my

715
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,260
answer would be yes and in my defense I

716
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,360
am actually no longer an active coder so

717
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,520
if I would be given access back to our

718
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,980
systems to our codes I'm pretty

719
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,600
confident I would introduce problems

720
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,299
because I'm no longer I didn't upskill

721
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,700
myself in the last couple of years new

722
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,820
things are coming out new Frameworks new

723
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,980
ways of developing code

724
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,840
um and I'm I'm not you know on a

725
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
day-to-day basis working with one

726
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,980
particular language and framework I

727
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,659
actually should not be given access to

728
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,400
production systems and creating code

729
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,460
because I'm not upskilled anymore

730
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,980
what does our survey say interestingly

731
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,220
enough our survey said said 48 said yes

732
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,559
19 said well it really depends on the

733
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,320
project and 33 said no

734
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,960
we thought that was pretty high we

735
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
thought that was pretty high and we were

736
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,100
kind of unsure about these results so I

737
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,659
actually did a little bit more research

738
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,179
and I was trying to figure out like do

739
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,440
other

740
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,179
um you know pieces of research come to

741
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,980
the same conclusion

742
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,779
and I actually found another piece of

743
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,419
research over here where the results are

744
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,760
very very similar where over 50 percent

745
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,100
said yes you know what we do push even

746
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,460
vulnerable code into production 48 said

747
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,399
yes we actually do it regularly 31 said

748
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,460
you know occasionally so a lot of the

749
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,840
self-awareness is there don't get me

750
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,340
wrong the self-awareness is there but

751
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,260
it's it's not good you know

752
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,580
and the next natural question is why why

753
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,880
why do we you know leave problems in

754
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,159
code why do these vulnerabilities exist

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,200
in your code

756
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,039
um

757
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,720
so it'd be great to have some answers

758
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,500
here

759
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,380
why do we have vulnerabilities in code

760
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,179
why do people push stuff into production

761
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,059
that they know is is actually pretty bad

762
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,720
any answers

763
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,720
why do we push broken stuff into

764
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,200
production

765
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,059
if that is not known as Big Bad impact

766
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,480
okay interesting one so it depends you

767
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,460
know over here

768
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,380
time pressure that is the the most

769
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,840
logical one right um uh Lewis I hope I

770
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,059
pronounce your name correctly time

771
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,279
pressure is is one that we definitely

772
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,419
see quite often I like your I like your

773
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,740
ones out where you say well you know it

774
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,000
really depends sometimes it's

775
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,799
nitty-gritty stuff and we know it's not

776
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,840
100 perfect but we just push it into

777
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,220
production

778
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,860
false assessment of criticality I like

779
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,440
it Lewis so yes developers they're not

780
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,659
all Security Experts and they try to

781
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,000
assess it themselves and they make a

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,980
false judgment essentially

783
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,179
it's only medium

784
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,320
dependencies have vulnerabilities

785
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,419
Jeremiah's I like that one it's a it's a

786
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,940
there's more more and more

787
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,120
um well the previous talk from Jeremy

788
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,159
was pretty much all about dependencies I

789
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,659
would assume

790
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,520
um so there's more and more a spotlight

791
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,760
on on that particular group of problems

792
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,980
too many permutation combinations to

793
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,880
look at

794
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,620
and not everyone has or has got Paranoid

795
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,659
Eyes lack of automated tools increases

796
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,779
load even more

797
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,380
oh that's a a predict let's say

798
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,960
technical answer

799
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,880
um the combinations okay so but that's

800
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,559
if you're looking from from an attacking

801
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,260
perspective nikhil I like that so from

802
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,760
an attacking perspective there's too

803
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,980
many too many options for an attacker

804
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,600
the whole idea of well we need to defend

805
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,100
against everything and an attacker only

806
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,980
has to find one problem and you're done

807
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,620
Louis we already have an exception for

808
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,419
this

809
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,520
for this release I love it I love the

810
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,080
answers thank you so much thanks for the

811
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,820
answers

812
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,779
um

813
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,700
So my answer why I would leave

814
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,799
vulnerabilities in code well I think for

815
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,419
me it's because I develop ebsco myself

816
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,399
you know fast enough in languages and

817
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,260
Frameworks because I have other

818
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,140
priorities and unfortunately

819
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,179
what does our survey say and we try to

820
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,460
categorize it a little bit into why do

821
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,140
people still they know they have

822
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
problems in code but you know they still

823
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,679
push it out

824
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,080
um functionality they they prioritize

825
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,539
functionality over security

826
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:40,260
um

827
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,899
deadline the timing aspect I've seen a

828
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,880
lot of the timing aspect although I

829
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,320
think there were more funny answers in

830
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,600
in this chat than what we saw in the in

831
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,820
the survey unaware people are just

832
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,159
unaware so working on the knowledge part

833
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,840
so over there it's not really a

834
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,460
behavioral part that it's really a

835
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,720
knowledge part

836
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,940
to do mongering one well everything is

837
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,919
broken we will never be able to get this

838
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,620
right so all code has vulnerabilities

839
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,419
and the last one is maybe you know

840
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,360
they're unfamiliar or um as one of the

841
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,919
persons in the chat said you know what

842
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,899
they they didn't assess the criticality

843
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,340
right enough Lewis thank you for that

844
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,799
one you were in in that that one fits in

845
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,360
there you know they weren't able to

846
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,740
address it

847
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,440
in any case I think it's problematic

848
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,460
right

849
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,740
um are there any good reasons I think

850
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,299
there are not

851
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,580
next one I'm I'm I don't want to switch

852
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,820
a little bit more to the behavioral side

853
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,080
um of things

854
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,840
um so we were wondering well

855
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,120
if if they do that you know if they

856
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,820
commit codes and they know it has a

857
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,200
problem

858
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,820
um or they do not know that it has a

859
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,980
problem you know it's just a fine commit

860
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,200
and and we're not aware of any problems

861
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,360
it turns out it's a bad commit would the

862
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,679
time of the day of that commitment

863
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,440
essentially influence the code quality

864
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,179
so what do you think there's the time of

865
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,100
the day if if you as a developer if you

866
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,440
check in code after mid say after

867
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,940
midnight

868
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,279
um will that had it has will that have

869
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,018
an influence on your code quality

870
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,000
for sure Andrei

871
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,679
most likely yes

872
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,480
so you have like two and a half yeses

873
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,500
and one

874
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,960
after midnight just push the merge

875
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,879
when I'm hungry or tired I'm less

876
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,739
diligent

877
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,659
well so actually Jeremiah's you are very

878
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,000
close to the answer my friend

879
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,560
you are very close to the answer so

880
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,199
first of all my answer my answer is I

881
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,900
hope it is not because I I I know you

882
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,720
developers you like to work on in on

883
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,060
irregular hours so I really hope it does

884
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,619
not have an influence

885
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:05,820
um because otherwise I know we're

886
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,960
screwed

887
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,839
be honest too is we are actually screwed

888
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,339
because

889
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,520
um uh there was a research done by E

890
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Olson and he figured out that or she

891
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,780
figured out I'm sorry I do not know he

892
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,800
or she figured out that the the the code

893
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,280
commit that is problematic is very

894
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,579
closely Reliant to our circadian rhythm

895
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,619
so essentially what what you're saying

896
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,240
over here Jeremiah's when I'm hungry or

897
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,640
tired is essentially comes very close to

898
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,859
your natural behavior so your natural

899
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,500
thing your natural body behavior on a

900
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,180
day-to-day basis which means that hey

901
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,480
your your Peak activity is between 10

902
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,540
and 2 p.m you do have a an afternoon dip

903
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,400
between two and four pm and then between

904
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,520
4 and 10 pm it it's still okay but it

905
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,619
still goes down and if you do stuff

906
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,079
after midnight well actually don't do it

907
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,859
it's it's not good your your your

908
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,540
Consciousness everything is like close

909
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,720
to zero and and this particular piece of

910
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,400
Visa so they figured out that it

911
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,900
actually is very closely related

912
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,540
developer experience does that influence

913
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,099
code quality and I have to be a little

914
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,020
bit more careful here what that means or

915
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,599
what we mean with developer experience

916
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,700
um what what the research looked at is

917
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,859
the number of commits to the repository

918
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,020
or the components meaning you know if

919
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,780
you're a regular committer we think you

920
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,460
are more experienced so that's that's

921
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,380
how we quantify you as more experience

922
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,780
and also the time of your first commit

923
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,560
so did are you there from the start or

924
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,900
did you come in fairly late into the

925
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,060
into the into the project into the code

926
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,079
base

927
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,560
so that's how we Define you know code

928
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,180
developer experience so do you think it

929
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,420
influences your code quality

930
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,480
um

931
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,359
yes or no do you think it influences the

932
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,099
code quality of your code if you're an

933
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,960
experienced developer by these

934
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,640
particular

935
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,720
um

936
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,618
measures

937
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,320
any takers

938
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,420
so does developer experienced influence

939
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,540
experience influence the code quality

940
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,700
Marco says not necessarily

941
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,759
Zao said yes the complete opposite

942
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Marco I think you you mean that maybe

943
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,859
our our initial criteria for for

944
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:52,619
defining developer experience are off

945
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,859
Jeremiah Say Yes

946
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,119
more commits might lead to more problems

947
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,560
that is true let's let's take a

948
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,300
percentage right now so more more

949
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,040
commits means you can actually make more

950
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,740
problems

951
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,540
my ex my my answer over here to this

952
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,700
particular question is I really hope it

953
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,560
does I really hope there is research

954
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,900
that points out that there is a

955
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,480
correlation between a good developer and

956
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,220
essentially less problems and creating

957
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,859
less problems than codes

958
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,079
I'm sorry one so one more from Marco

959
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,520
someone with more experience in other

960
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,140
projects may still provide better code

961
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,119
on the first commit in the new project

962
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,520
that's an interesting perspective uh

963
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,960
Marco

964
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,900
um well the reason I bring this up is

965
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,880
because I think this was very decent

966
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,859
research this this was really you know

967
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,839
done on on something something

968
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,000
substantial it was done on the on the

969
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,220
Microsoft and it was done on the Linux

970
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,740
kernel and postgres where they did find

971
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,500
actually a correlation between

972
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,839
um uh what they called drive-by

973
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,060
developers if if you have a drive-by

974
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,740
developer that just makes one or two

975
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,940
commits

976
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,460
um very irregularly well then they're

977
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,440
the likelihood of of having a

978
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,500
problematic commit is higher than a

979
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,060
person that is quite often in the code

980
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,000
base and and also if that person is

981
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,980
there from the start so even if he or

982
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,720
she is not committing quite often but if

983
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,520
he or she is there from the start well

984
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,800
they essentially make less problems so

985
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,380
great there is a correlation between

986
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,960
um a developer that is experienced and

987
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,420
the influence on the code quality

988
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,700
now you may ask the question but one

989
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,800
second why why are you telling this how

990
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,680
how does this help us you know well in

991
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,099
my view I I think with these questions

992
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,800
if we can work with the answers on how

993
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,440
developers see secure coding

994
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,420
um on how how you're coding on a

995
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,579
day-to-day basis if if time pressure If

996
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,260
there is actually research that says you

997
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,220
know what

998
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,920
um time pressure is is a problem for

999
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,480
developers and they create more problems

1000
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,700
if you ask them to work late nights and

1001
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,859
the code really needs to be done well we

1002
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,420
need to create a better environment for

1003
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,640
developers as well so that they can

1004
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
Thrive so that they can have the

1005
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,500
knowledge and we work on the behavior so

1006
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,020
that essentially we create better habits

1007
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,119
what happens if you do something like

1008
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,859
that well actually if you do something

1009
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,920
like that and we did something we we

1010
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,780
worked on the knowledge so we we

1011
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,240
upskilled 5000 developers but we also

1012
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,160
worked on the behavioral part where we

1013
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,140
incentivized them and we actually gave

1014
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,680
them time to upskill themselves well if

1015
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,079
you get these two bits and pieces in

1016
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,300
line well you can actually do a lot of

1017
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,940
things you can actually eradicate

1018
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,800
recurring vulnerabilities in code from

1019
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,060
the start

1020
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,680
um it's not with tooling but if this is

1021
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,660
with people what you do is you upskill

1022
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,940
you train an entire organization but

1023
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,220
also you work on the behavior part and

1024
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,480
then you can actually book some real

1025
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,820
successes

1026
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,660
foreign

1027
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,060
question what happens with the number of

1028
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,740
vulnerabilities

1029
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,320
after your developers care do you think

1030
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,300
it goes up or do you think it goes down

1031
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,500
if you're the

1032
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,660
should be an obvious one right so what

1033
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,380
happens with the number of

1034
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,700
vulnerabilities

1035
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,500
after your developers care

1036
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,579
Jeremiah's it goes down

1037
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,800
I think that's everybody everybody's

1038
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,599
answer right everybody will hope that it

1039
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,420
goes down even myself my answer would be

1040
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,300
it goes down big time

1041
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,540
well we had one customer that said he

1042
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,020
goes up but then it goes down so

1043
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,520
um and the reason is pretty interesting

1044
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,220
and when your developers care they start

1045
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,020
to care more about the code and they

1046
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,359
start to realize that they either made

1047
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,000
mistakes themselves and while they're

1048
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,040
not always able to immediately fix that

1049
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,500
particular problem they can still open a

1050
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,660
bug or open a ticket and make sure it's

1051
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,180
in the system so it can be handled

1052
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,700
or they can actually spot problems and

1053
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,280
codes that are there not made by

1054
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,079
themselves but because they've learned

1055
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,940
they spot problems in code that they're

1056
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,200
working on and they're going to file

1057
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,359
these these problems so initially it

1058
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,700
goes up but then yes it does go down

1059
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,859
luckily

1060
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,079
but when I was working on this

1061
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,400
particular slide I was like well you

1062
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,740
know what what but but

1063
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,359
you know why do they find them doesn't

1064
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,460
the SAS solution find all these problems

1065
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,680
you know I we thought there's plenty of

1066
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,380
plenty of tools in place why does it is

1067
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,240
it still possible to go at the SAS

1068
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,400
solution should find all of this so my

1069
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,740
next question if for the people on this

1070
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,599
call what percentage of vulnerabilities

1071
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,760
do you think are found by a SAS solution

1072
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,520
Jeremiah's 25 percent

1073
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,119
40 to 50 50 percent

1074
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,079
it goes up

1075
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,660
I'll give you my answer I thought it was

1076
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,660
even more than 50 so this is the range

1077
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,260
from 25 to to 50 I thought it was 60 and

1078
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,540
I have a reasoning for that my best

1079
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,420
guess was 60 because back in the day I

1080
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,400
did a research project where we used the

1081
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,020
SAS solution and we used the Das

1082
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,839
solution and what we were after was the

1083
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:20,700
overlap between the SAS and the dash

1084
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,800
solution and we saw that there was very

1085
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,900
minimal overlap between the SAS and that

1086
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,460
solution they essentially found

1087
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,859
different problems in code so let's say

1088
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,720
you find 100 and if there's a small

1089
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,240
overlap which means you know every every

1090
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,460
tool find a little bit more than 50 so

1091
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,140
my my reasoning is you know what it's

1092
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,900
going to be 60 percent

1093
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,359
that is not entirely true

1094
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:45,480
um I found some research that that they

1095
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,380
did

1096
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,180
um where they said you know what only 14

1097
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,460
is found by a SAS solution and

1098
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,780
interestingly enough in that research

1099
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,700
they claim that

1100
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,500
um the combination of different SAS

1101
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,000
solution gives you a very high

1102
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,160
percentage every SAS solution seems to

1103
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,480
be engineered in a little bit of a

1104
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,920
different way and they find a little bit

1105
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,660
of different problems in the same code

1106
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,940
base and I thought that was pretty

1107
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,200
interesting

1108
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,359
to me it actually proves that you know

1109
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,520
we will not get a way out with with with

1110
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,700
tools and throwing more tools at the

1111
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,460
problem will not necessarily help we

1112
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,960
need to make sure that we essentially

1113
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,160
invest in the people as well

1114
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,839
so ultimately I'm right on the 45

1115
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:26,339
minutes

1116
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,079
oh thank you Zao I'm sorry I didn't see

1117
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,300
your your 80

1118
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,859
um but I have to very much disappoint

1119
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,680
you with the 80 percent

1120
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,140
so ultimately I think it's it's creating

1121
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,400
an environment it's creating an

1122
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,500
environment where our developers can

1123
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,619
Thrive and our developers you know or do

1124
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,180
first of all have access to the

1125
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,220
knowledge and they're able to upskill

1126
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,420
themselves they're able to train

1127
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,220
themselves they're able

1128
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,780
um to know about these Frameworks and

1129
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,520
how to use these Frameworks but at the

1130
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,260
same time we have to make sure the

1131
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,540
behavior is there as well

1132
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,760
um time certification opportunity

1133
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,980
incentive there's a lot that we can do

1134
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,260
with this piece of research

1135
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,940
um that where we can create a better

1136
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,180
environment for the developer

1137
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,520
maybe last but not least

1138
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,220
um I I do think I I touched lightly on

1139
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,900
certification throughout the certified

1140
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,420
throughout this presentation other

1141
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,520
Industries are doing it

1142
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,440
um I do think certification is coming

1143
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,119
our way as well

1144
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,560
um there's more and more incentives to

1145
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,599
do certification and to make sure that

1146
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,700
we can prove ourselves and say hey you

1147
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,900
know what we know what we're doing we

1148
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,220
know what we're doing

1149
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,740
um we can handle this um we can be a

1150
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,859
critical piece of other Industries and

1151
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:39,480
make sure that these industries did not

1152
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,740
go down because of the software

1153
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,960
last but not least

1154
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,619
um

1155
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,000
I think

1156
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,280
from an application security perspective

1157
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,440
I think ultimately we need to be aware

1158
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,980
the developer is the developer already

1159
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,220
has a system has an IDE

1160
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,319
um so the behavioral aspect we have to

1161
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,119
make sure that from a security

1162
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,760
perspective we are more and more closer

1163
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,280
to the developer and we work with the

1164
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,800
tools and the systems on where a

1165
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,900
developer is on a day-to-day basis I

1166
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,460
think that's the only way we can win and

1167
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,619
it's a it's a it's it's definitely

1168
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,180
creating that environment but our

1169
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,680
environment should be essentially their

1170
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,940
environment

1171
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,400
with that I would like to leave you and

1172
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,140
I've asked a lot of questions during the

1173
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,720
presentation so now it's time

1174
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,400
um for all of you on the call to ask me

1175
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,660
some questions

1176
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,560
if there are any

1177
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
hi thanks for that

1178
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
okay that was really interesting I am

1179
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,260
going to just look in the tool now to

1180
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,180
see if there's any questions in the Q a

1181
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,839
just a reminder to everybody and you can

1182
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,740
enter in questions in the Q a section

1183
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,619
within the Hoover app and it's separish

1184
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,960
to the chat or the comment section that

1185
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,359
you've been using just to interact with

1186
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,920
the Mateus there

1187
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,960
so

1188
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,540
so I see one in the comment section to

1189
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,780
be honest okay uh did you include false

1190
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,880
positives in your analysis

1191
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,500
oh that's a great that's a great

1192
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,599
question so by the way

1193
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,960
um um in your analysis so when when we

1194
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,760
did our research the way I came up with

1195
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,300
the 60 so yes we did look into that

1196
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,859
um and the other research that I'm

1197
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,859
referring to uh they they did go through

1198
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:32,099
the um the results so yes there was some

1199
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,020
um normalization I'm not sure how to

1200
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,579
call that but they they did look into

1201
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,800
the results and they made sure that uh

1202
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,359
they read out the false positives

1203
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,720
foreign

1204
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,680
question here so do you think a more

1205
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,780
rigorous approach especially in the

1206
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,319
areas where the company is regulated and

1207
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,420
should occur when it comes to ensuring

1208
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,819
that developers are trained in Secure

1209
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:02,359
development

1210
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,000
I think it's coming right I I I'm

1211
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,160
convinced there's going to be more and

1212
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,839
more of a need in that area

1213
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,339
My Philosophy has always been that

1214
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:16,020
developers really want to do the right

1215
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,540
thing unfortunately we're not able to to

1216
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,420
to provide them with the right thing at

1217
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,660
the right time in the right place

1218
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,040
I do see more and more University

1219
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,400
programs embedding secure coding and and

1220
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,440
the act of creating secure code I don't

1221
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,079
think we're quite there yet but it's

1222
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,880
already earlier in the process that

1223
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,280
developers get in touch with hey you

1224
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,859
know what people can misuse my code they

1225
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,960
can do things with my application that I

1226
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,540
did not intend to be there and oh my God

1227
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,180
it has security implications

1228
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,460
um but what I've always and I've always

1229
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,380
believed and I'm always convinced that

1230
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,079
developer wants to do the right thing on

1231
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,680
a day-to-day basis it's only a matter of

1232
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,140
knowledge and behavior making sure they

1233
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,420
know what to do but also making sure the

1234
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,400
the environment they're working in

1235
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,960
allows them to do the right thing

1236
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,160
I agreed on that

1237
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,020
um another question that has just come

1238
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,200
through is what is the trend is it

1239
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,060
getting better over the years when it

1240
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,619
comes to the number of vulnerabilities

1241
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,520
found in software

1242
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,260
uh oh there's a couple of ways I can

1243
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,319
answer that question

1244
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,520
um one Trend that we see is

1245
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,720
um the notion of a baseline so where a

1246
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,700
static analysis solution is present and

1247
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,560
it only goes up so at a certain point in

1248
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,720
time they realize oh my God we do not

1249
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,520
have to introduce more problems in code

1250
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,880
so from that point in time they they

1251
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,440
stick with the Baseline and they make

1252
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,780
sure that it's it's it's not getting any

1253
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,140
worse however they also realize well you

1254
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,880
know what it's not getting any better in

1255
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,579
a sense that we're not reducing or or

1256
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,560
risk profile because existing problems

1257
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,180
are still there and nobody is tackling

1258
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,660
the existing problems and and to to

1259
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,359
tackle that particular problem My

1260
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,300
Philosophy over here is application

1261
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,920
security isn't a label to do that we're

1262
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,560
we're still two percent of versus the

1263
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,480
developers so two application security

1264
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,660
people per 100 developers My Philosophy

1265
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,940
is how can we bring the 100 developers

1266
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,040
on the journey how can we work with the

1267
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,560
100 developers and have a portion of

1268
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,300
security skill developers security

1269
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,420
champions in these 100 developers and

1270
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,220
and and that's how I think we can get

1271
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,020
out of the problem so is it getting any

1272
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,880
better or any worse

1273
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,040
um I'm convinced it's it's it's going

1274
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,599
better I'm convinced it's going better

1275
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,220
because we're working on that Baseline

1276
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,380
and we want to reduce the Baseline and

1277
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,000
we're thinking about bringing the the

1278
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,920
developers on the journey and I think

1279
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,760
that is a key to success because

1280
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,319
these people write the code you know as

1281
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,540
application security folks we can we can

1282
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,339
give hints we can give them information

1283
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,380
give them we can even give them training

1284
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,319
but if they're not convinced if if they

1285
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,300
are if they do not believe in it if they

1286
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,800
do not want to do it it's not it's not

1287
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,119
going to work so we need to bring

1288
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,400
developers on the journey and I I think

1289
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,099
it's going in the right direction

1290
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:17,160
that is good to know and another couple

1291
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,720
of questions that have come in I'm going

1292
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,119
to put these two together so it's saying

1293
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,280
what are some of the most important

1294
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,140
subjects you would teach developers

1295
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,359
about secure coding and then how would

1296
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,180
you track or see improvement from these

1297
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,640
trainings with regards to secure coding

1298
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,380
would you use a tool or something

1299
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,260
similar okay great great so so so first

1300
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,819
question

1301
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,460
um so first part of the question we

1302
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,859
really need to train developers in

1303
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,839
something that is relevant I think it

1304
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,400
does not make sense to give a high level

1305
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,900
video on like hey you know what people

1306
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,300
can misuse and there's things like SQL

1307
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,380
injection and you need to use

1308
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,240
parameterized queries without going into

1309
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,880
the details it has to be very relevant

1310
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,460
to the technology that we're using the

1311
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,960
language and framework that they're

1312
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,400
using

1313
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,559
um but also even within the language and

1314
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,500
framework if you do not have a database

1315
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,119
it's irrelevant to teach people about

1316
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,180
SQL injection so we need to tell them

1317
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,819
stuff that that is relevant for for on

1318
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,339
their day-to-day basis so that was your

1319
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:19,020
first question you're saying oh your

1320
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,640
second question was around

1321
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,880
um impact in Improvement that is a very

1322
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,160
tricky one let's you know it is a very

1323
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,380
tricky one and in general in application

1324
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,240
security it's it's a very tricky one

1325
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,380
because

1326
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,240
um even for SAS solutions for example

1327
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,880
number of vulnerabilities well is that

1328
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,280
is that do you have better code is 10

1329
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,040
vulnerabilities good as 20 good is one

1330
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,599
good you know you have no idea like

1331
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,700
finding more problems is not the end

1332
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,819
goal of of a static analysis solution

1333
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,680
um the end goal of us as a security

1334
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,440
industry should be to shift reliable

1335
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,800
code fast that should be our objective

1336
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,140
and and not find as many problems as

1337
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,760
possible in code

1338
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,099
but back to the ROI piece how how can

1339
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,140
you prove Roi there's there's a couple

1340
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,780
of ways we can do it although they are

1341
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,400
non-trivial you know they're definitely

1342
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,960
non-trivial

1343
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,720
um my my my favorite one but also most

1344
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,000
difficult one is you do a static

1345
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,359
analysis scan first then you roll out a

1346
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:21,900
training program based on um what you

1347
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,180
see in the static analysis scan and then

1348
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,040
you do another static analysis scan a

1349
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,160
year later and what we see is that

1350
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,619
there's a a significant reduction in

1351
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,540
problems in these categories that you

1352
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,280
said hey you know what we're gonna make

1353
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,960
sure and we're gonna upskill people in

1354
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,720
those areas it is a non-trivial exercise

1355
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,400
why because

1356
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,200
um it has to be driven by the

1357
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,359
organization itself there's not one tool

1358
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,859
or one solution that can do something

1359
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:49,339
like that

1360
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,760
okay yeah that makes sense and somebody

1361
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,579
has just requested that you could you

1362
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:58,500
show the last knowledge or behavior

1363
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,260
overview slide again

1364
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,660
I'm not sure how far back that is on

1365
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,200
your deck

1366
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,180
I'm not sure which one this one

1367
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,819
I will say yes it's the last one

1368
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:22,980
yes that's if it's if if that's not the

1369
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,960
right one whoever posted that question

1370
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,819
please feel free to

1371
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:30,240
add a replying and then two other

1372
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,240
questions that are pretty so so by the

1373
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,220
way ping me if if you want to you know

1374
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,380
have a have a copy or whatever of of um

1375
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,359
what I've shown so for people that are

1376
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,460
interested in stuff uh feel free to also

1377
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,460
reach out to me over LinkedIn or email

1378
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,140
great that was my next question actually

1379
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,240
because somebody had actually asked how

1380
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,099
can they get a key summary or key

1381
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,440
message from this session and also

1382
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,440
somebody is asked about do you have a

1383
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,440
list of secure coding patterns that you

1384
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,339
could share

1385
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:02,280
who reach out to me so we're working on

1386
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,380
something internally

1387
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,640
um

1388
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,220
I I I'm not sure if we published that

1389
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,619
but so the person asking that question

1390
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:13,559
can definitely reach out to me and we're

1391
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,059
working on something and so we did some

1392
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:16,859
work in Java around secure coding

1393
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:19,440
patterns classification

1394
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,099
um

1395
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,079
that's just our research there's stuff

1396
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,059
out there as well so it's it's of course

1397
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,400
not the only only piece of research out

1398
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,420
there

1399
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,819
okay and then the last question just

1400
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:33,119
before we let you go is

1401
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,940
um do you think that trained

1402
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,240
secure coding developers should focus on

1403
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,079
building

1404
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,980
secure application Frameworks and to

1405
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,559
develop secure code without

1406
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,440
another developer having to know about

1407
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,660
security uh so so so this may be

1408
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,280
counter-intuitive but if you can fix it

1409
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,800
with a framework

1410
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,200
change absolutely you know there's no

1411
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,780
reason to to teach people about a

1412
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,640
certain thing if it's actually resolved

1413
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,440
in the framework so the more we can do

1414
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,119
in Frameworks the more we can make our

1415
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,339
framework secure the better the

1416
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,520
unfortunate truth is well it's really

1417
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,859
hard to switch Frameworks and we have

1418
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,020
plenty of Legacy code that we're still

1419
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,599
building on top of we never start from

1420
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,220
scratch unfortunately we're building

1421
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,440
stuff on top of broken stuff on top of

1422
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,900
broken stuff so

1423
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,119
please by all means if we have better

1424
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,520
Frameworks if we can make a framework

1425
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,500
change to eradicate the category of

1426
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,500
problems I'm an absolute fan of that

1427
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,119
because there's already plenty of stuff

1428
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,359
that a developer needs to learn to to to

1429
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,700
create code on a day-to-day basis and by

1430
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,200
the way it's not only about security but

1431
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,200
it's it's about performance it's it's

1432
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,180
about plenty of other things that they

1433
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,920
need to take into consideration to build

1434
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,960
secure to build code to build quality

1435
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,640
codes

1436
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,119
thanks for that and and I think that's

1437
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,880
it for Q a just wanted to say on behalf

1438
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,040
of our wasp thank you very much for your

1439
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,140
taking the time to speak to us today it

1440
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,300
was a really enjoyable and interactive

1441
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,579
talk and I think the audience also

1442
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,180
enjoyed it
