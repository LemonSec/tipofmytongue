1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,779
hello this is uh Alan may I will be the

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,679
moderator for this one recession so um

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,700
uh welcome to this oasp 2022 virtual

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,199
upsec EU session uh the presenter is

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,640
Michael uh boreenoms I will ask him to

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,800
introduce himself I would say a few

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,039
things after and then we'll start go

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
ahead Michael

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,020
thanks Helen uh so hi hi everyone

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,480
um in fact I I moved my slide to

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
introduce myself to the ends just to do

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,040
something different uh so but I really

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,800
want to cover the content today

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
so let's see if we get to to my bio

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,059
slide it's not the most important thing

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,879
that I want to talk to you about

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
but so today is about uh late threat

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,780
modeling

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,020
electric modeling in the sense that

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,020
we distinguish multiple layers in in the

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,539
threat modeling as we all know it and

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,860
that's really what I what I would like

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
to talk to you about and see also what

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
your opinions are or perhaps questions

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,340
that you may have

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,619
so this is presented by myself there is

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,320
a co-creator of Matthias hubrickson who

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,360
really helped me a lot in creating these

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,759
slides who also works together with me

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,640
in Splinter

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,580
so just as a short agenda we we have a

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,060
small hour and I really have some things

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,180
that I that I would like to talk about

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,979
um but it's about layer threat modeling

35
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,380
and I first want to introduce the

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,720
difference also with solution thread

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,799
modeling

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
and I also want to cover some of the

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,659
literature uh review the methodologies

40
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,720
Frameworks that actually support this

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,759
this layering so it's not something that

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,640
that we invented ourselves this talk is

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,159
basically a summary of things that we

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,159
have read and that we think are useful

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,680
in in practice

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,439
now to make it a bit more concrete for

47
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,099
this talk I actually

48
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,160
use the clouds as a problem statement as

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,260
as an example

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,700
uh because you know it's always

51
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,980
difficult in these talks to to use

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,280
real-life examples from customers it's

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,920
not really allowed typically and so I

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,140
created this cloud service model example

55
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,379
which in the end actually I must say

56
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,180
even though I say it myself which which

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,360
I will definitely be using in the future

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,400
because I think it's pretty useful and

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
pretty a pretty nice model if you ever

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,340
need to

61
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,840
assess the difference between cloud

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,500
service models like er spouse cars Etc

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,940
and so on

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,459
so we will cover that as well and then I

65
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,019
want to Deep dive in the methods which

66
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,660
is if you know solution threat modeling

67
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
and I call solution treatment the

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,519
traditional threat modeling type of way

69
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,500
if you know that this this method is not

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,540
new so we model the context we identify

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,879
threats and we manage controls

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,920
and I have a short practical demo as

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,640
well using Arch make let me just take a

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,260
laser pointer as well

75
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
so a very short practical demo and some

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,239
conclusions and common pitfalls that I

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,659
also would like to present to you

78
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,019
so as an introduction a threat modeling

79
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,599
um I hope you all know it I hope you all

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,180
know about solution threat modeling

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,180
and typically a solution threat model in

82
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,519
my experience is focused on a single

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,659
solution

84
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,400
and here on the on the right of the

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,099
slide I just have an example which we

86
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,200
will not cover anymore in detail in this

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,099
talk

88
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,040
but we have dfds or I've used the DFD

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,680
here to actually model

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,799
a solution with the threads with some

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,620
controls with the assets that may be

92
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,640
relevant

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,340
and typically we use different notations

94
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,099
so dfds are are ones of the the most

95
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,739
known in this context but we can use uml

96
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,840
diagrams as well we can use physio

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,439
documents even it doesn't really matter

98
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,420
we also can use various techniques like

99
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,400
stride London there are many more

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,620
perhaps you use them that's not what I

101
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,478
will be talking about today but you will

102
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,180
see that there are a lot of

103
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,340
similarities with architectural threat

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,919
modeling as I presented here

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,259
but most importantly and that's I I hope

106
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,240
something that that you can take away

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,460
there there are also important

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,740
differences

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,900
so if we look at the software

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,520
development life cycle a typical

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,620
software development life cycle and is

112
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,600
displayed here and perhaps you use some

113
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
kind of agile model but I put a nice

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,600
repetition Arrow here which basically

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,900
covers everything right so it's easy

116
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,940
but we typically do solution threat

117
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,400
modeling in the design phase so we

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,199
gather the requirements then we have the

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,400
design and then we should be doing

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,740
threat modeling and again this is not

121
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
something that all companies do already

122
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,300
so solution thread modeling is a must

123
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,360
and you should be doing it

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
um during the design phase then we go to

125
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,660
build test move to collection Etc this I

126
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,060
assume you know

127
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,460
and if I may make an analogy with uh

128
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,440
with the forming business I'm not sure

129
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,539
if it's a good one but okay analogies

130
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,460
are always nice

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,120
then typically if you use a solution

132
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,820
thread modeling it will help you in

133
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,580
designing a barn securely

134
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,919
it will help you in designing a solution

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,419
one single solution securely

136
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,639
now typically as as Enterprise security

137
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,639
Architects and and I actually asked uh

138
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,680
you as some of you answered the poll

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
before this talk

140
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
whether in your company you make the

141
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,740
difference between architectural threat

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,100
modeling and solution threat modeling

143
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,960
and I see that many of you actually make

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,180
that difference so that's that's nice to

145
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,940
see and so I guess you you understand

146
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,639
when I talk about perhaps you do not

147
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,919
want to build a single barn a single

148
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:11,940
solution

149
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,699
but instead you would like to to

150
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,340
architect an entire form right like you

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,900
see here with the windmill with with

152
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,020
chickens and people and and buildings uh

153
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,419
and a nice fence

154
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,000
and as an Enterprise architect and I'm

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,800
not talking about security architecture

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
but as an Enterprise architect you

157
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,060
attempt to make a model you try to

158
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,880
architect this entire form and as an

159
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Enterprise security architect you will

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
try to use business attributes now the

161
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
attributes are important to the business

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,699
and you would like them to traceably

163
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,460
link to some of the deep down security

164
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,319
controls that you have in your Solutions

165
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,340
so this is basically my starting point

166
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,759
how can we do threat modeling at this

167
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,340
level at the level of the form instead

168
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,340
of at the level of the of the bar

169
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,639
and so as a software Architects and

170
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,139
there are different names saying some

171
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,340
companies it's called solution

172
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,960
architecture Solutions security

173
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,860
architecture software security architect

174
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,039
these people typically help to design a

175
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,319
single bar a single solution

176
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,319
and that's ideal to actually use

177
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,660
solution thread modeling so when I talk

178
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,400
about again a solution threat modeling

179
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,080
is it's a threat modeling that we all

180
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,840
know uh with the dfds and all the lines

181
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,120
using this kind of threat modeling a

182
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,460
solution security architect is able to

183
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,280
define a system security controls

184
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,380
development security controls which are

185
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,539
very important so they are extremely

186
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,860
important

187
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,680
and it's at the level of the solution

188
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,900
on the right of this slide you see

189
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,819
Enterprise security architecture it's

190
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,099
not better it's not worse it's just a

191
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,680
different role with different goals and

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,539
different responsibilities

193
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,300
and this kind of person helps design a

194
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,400
complete form

195
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,599
and

196
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
our argument is that actually this kind

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,919
of person can employ architectural

198
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,300
threat modeling

199
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,220
what we're going to present in this

200
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,979
slideshow to actually reach that

201
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,240
objective

202
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,160
and that's one of the very important

203
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,120
differences in my view between the the

204
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
solution thread modeling and the

205
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,539
architectural thread modeling

206
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,120
the actual goals of architectural threat

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,740
moving are much different

208
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,240
and we want to Define security

209
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,419
objectives security principles and more

210
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,779
genetic security control so we are at at

211
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,020
a higher level of abstraction compared

212
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,660
to the solution architecture

213
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,279
so again a on the left you see here the

214
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,580
the the sdlc where we do solution threat

215
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,279
modeling that's uh designing a single

216
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,500
board but the argument of this

217
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,480
presentation of this talk is we also

218
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,060
need to thread model at the Enterprise

219
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,380
architecture layer

220
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,600
and we'll do it it's the same with with

221
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
solution thread modeling everybody does

222
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,100
it perhaps we just do not do it formally

223
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,040
or we do not have a formal method that

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,940
we follow

225
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,220
but everyone threat models also

226
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,560
Enterprise security Architects threat

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,339
model

228
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,800
in this talk I would like to present a

229
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,940
more methodic more strict approach to

230
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,899
that kind of track model

231
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,399
this is a bit of a theoretical slide to

232
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,560
see okay what we are discussing here

233
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,160
does it actually or is it backed up by

234
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,620
literature is it backed up by Frameworks

235
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,560
like Telegraph substance

236
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,600
and to be honest I I'm not sure today

237
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,459
that I was allowed to show the subside

238
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,019
Matrix you can just find it on the

239
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,100
internet

240
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,500
um but I I did make the attempt to to

241
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,100
check the licensing of subsa and it was

242
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,779
a bit unclear I also did not ask them

243
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,940
because I guess I I would would have

244
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,820
been allowed to to use it but in talks

245
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,519
and and trainings it's not allowed just

246
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,620
like that so that's why I blurred it but

247
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,220
you can also uh go with if you would

248
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,600
like to

249
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,540
and in fact subsides much or the sub

250
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,940
Matrix is very similar to The zachmann

251
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,380
Matrix

252
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,240
but on the left there we have togaf

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,459
where we have an architecture Continuum

254
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,080
and a solution is Continuum this is not

255
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,060
a talk about photograph if you don't

256
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,700
know it it's not that that much of a

257
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,720
problem but what we see is that actually

258
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,399
um all of these Frameworks

259
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,019
they make a difference between the

260
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,019
higher layer architectures and the more

261
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,800
solution focused architecture

262
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,019
if we have talked about solution threat

263
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,940
modeling in the past again we see that

264
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,440
the threat modeling is more at this

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,680
solution architecture and not at the

266
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,339
Enterprise architecture layer

267
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,320
you also see the goals again they are

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,420
different at an Enterprise architecture

269
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,160
layer we would like to to come up with

270
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,740
threats with risks with with genetic

271
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,680
principles that can be used in subsa we

272
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,540
call it the contextual conceptual and

273
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,360
and also logical layer whereas the

274
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,399
solution architecture is more the the

275
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,440
physical and the and the component

276
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,720
layers

277
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,480
so all of this just to say that okay we

278
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,700
have investigated this as well

279
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,980
and we've seen that actually all of

280
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,980
these Frameworks support uh this kind of

281
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,040
Distinction in layers for threat model

282
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,800
if we now go to a more concrete example

283
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,560
um that we can use throughout this talk

284
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,620
again I I have focused on cloud service

285
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,300
models because I think it's a question

286
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,060
that all of us face at some point in

287
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,260
time

288
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,959
and that all of us can also relate to if

289
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,700
we have to choose between a cloud

290
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,399
service model as a company

291
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,800
do we have to choose IRS do we have to

292
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,019
choose paths can we use all of them

293
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,000
interchangeably

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,260
we have to have a reasoning to actually

295
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,540
um explain to the business why or why

296
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,600
not we can use a certain service model

297
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,180
and which principles we then must be

298
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,940
following and for me this is a perfect

299
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,519
example of where architectural thread

300
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,040
modeling can come into into play

301
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,200
so I I do not

302
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,079
um well pretend to to be a cloud expert

303
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,899
I also do not pretend that that I know

304
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,839
more about these uh this the what the

305
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,480
cloud is than all of you

306
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,420
uh but this is just the essential

307
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,860
characteristics the service models and

308
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,420
the deployment models the the

309
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,060
definitions of a cloud basically

310
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,920
but what's more important is here on the

311
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,740
right I copied a matrix for Microsoft

312
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,200
which is often known as the shared

313
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
responsibility model

314
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,339
so depending on which service model you

315
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,420
choose you see Spa see us here depending

316
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,579
on which service model you use you have

317
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,740
different responsibilities or

318
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,959
better set the responsibilities May

319
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,779
shift to the cloud provide

320
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,180
this makes a lot of sense so for example

321
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,279
if you if you move to the cloud whether

322
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,959
it's IELTS paths or Stars the first

323
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,820
thing that is out of your control is the

324
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,839
data center

325
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,579
so that's also the first thing that is

326
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,620
actually the responsibility of your

327
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,720
provider and that's what we mean with

328
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
the shared responsibility model

329
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,579
information and data almost always

330
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,300
remains your responsibility as a as a

331
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
cloud customer that remains your

332
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,899
responsibility

333
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,240
but often at the the infrastructure the

334
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
data center the physical Network Etc

335
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,740
that shifts the management of that

336
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,399
shifts to the cloud provide

337
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,160
all of this just to set the scene at

338
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,940
what I would like to do is or to show as

339
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,459
an example of architectural threat

340
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,880
modeling

341
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,459
it's okay and now now we can now we can

342
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,579
dive into it a bit if you want to do

343
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,500
architectural threat modeling there are

344
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,260
several steps that you need to take

345
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,060
and it's very important

346
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,420
and they are pretty similar again to the

347
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,240
default traditional threat model steps

348
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,560
that you need to take

349
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,740
Step Zero for me is very important uh

350
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,019
it's actually to define a meta model to

351
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,459
come to a common uh terminology that you

352
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,660
can use throughout the Enterprise

353
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,600
perhaps even across Enterprises but

354
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,339
that's what we see more and more often

355
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,440
also thanks to conferences like this

356
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,079
that even we want to to share

357
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,120
information to share threat models

358
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,459
across organizations

359
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,519
well to me that requires a shared meta

360
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,560
model a common meta model

361
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,600
and again there are actually some

362
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,399
initiatives listed here that

363
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,220
Define these common meta models of which

364
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
one of the most important ones is the

365
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,019
issm paper so you can also find

366
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,899
references on the slide

367
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,000
where they Define really okay what is

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,339
important and what do we need in an

369
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,000
information system security context that

370
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,220
we need the business asset we need risks

371
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,199
we have impacts we have threats we have

372
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,940
vulnerabilities

373
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,220
all of these are terms that you're

374
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,620
probably familiar with but that need to

375
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,139
be very strictly defined if we start

376
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,639
using

377
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,300
um a certain framework certain method in

378
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,339
a company

379
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,060
there are also some other references

380
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,040
nist Adam showstack of course are one of

381
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,399
the the biggest in in this game the open

382
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,079
group as well

383
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,120
that have defined some Concepts that are

384
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,120
useful for crit modeling and again you

385
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,420
see actually similar Concepts appear and

386
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,880
like risks events impact threat events

387
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,980
in this case threat agents

388
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,500
so they make sense and we can link them

389
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,620
to the issm model as well

390
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,480
and then we have to have an archimate

391
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,760
and archimate well we'll be using our

392
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,940
teammates uh here because I think it's

393
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,459
it's basically the the standards these

394
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,339
days the de facto modeling standard for

395
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,040
Enterprise architecture

396
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,800
and so we need to map The Meta model is

397
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
REM meta model to archimate as well and

398
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,480
these are some Arch made elements we

399
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,980
will come back to that it doesn't really

400
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,079
it's not that important for this talk

401
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,240
but we had to make the mapping between

402
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,459
Isis

403
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,579
concept and an Archie made element

404
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,560
and that's basically what you see here

405
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,019
on the right of this table these are the

406
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,980
elements that we use in this talk

407
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,420
and how they map again to the issm

408
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,520
concept so for example for a threads

409
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,380
every use an event and a nectar for

410
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,599
threat event and a track connector

411
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,939
this may seem

412
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:12,839
um

413
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,059
easy to do and it's not that difficult

414
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,699
but you must have this meta model before

415
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,400
you can proceed

416
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,319
so what you see here is is actually the

417
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,839
meta model that we use it's a bit

418
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,460
simplified I got rid of the uh the

419
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,620
invisible relations the implicit

420
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,200
relations but basically this is a meta

421
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,059
model that we have used and that that

422
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,160
proved very useful

423
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,679
and it also incorporates all of the

424
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,260
elements of issm all of the concepts of

425
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,440
issrm but then mapped to the archimate

426
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,880
language

427
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,919
and this meta model is the one that we

428
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,799
use so what does it say okay we have we

429
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,419
have threat events we focus here on

430
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,000
threats threat agents and they they can

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,340
initiate threat events

432
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,020
operative that typically exploits a

433
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,160
vulnerability

434
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
Etc and that's why we need security

435
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,360
requirements to actually control these

436
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,840
vulnerabilities and therefore to control

437
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,600
these events that threaten my or the

438
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,280
organizations assets

439
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,660
so we talk more most about the lift part

440
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,720
but you will see uh in the demo that

441
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,240
actually I leave the door open to also

442
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
move towards an impact assessment which

443
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,380
is typically different from threat

444
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,059
assessments and threat assessments they

445
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,640
they typically are about likelihoods

446
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,980
whereas impact assessments well they are

447
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,020
about impact and you need both to come

448
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,340
to a risk

449
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,520
threat modeling usually focuses on

450
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,980
identifying threats identifying the

451
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,900
likelihood of these threats

452
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
then we have step one and I will show

453
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
that also a bit in archimator but this

454
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,360
these are the screenshots because

455
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,340
ultimate can be a bit overwhelming in

456
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,260
that case the model became a bit bigger

457
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,840
than initially uh expected as just an

458
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,360
example for this talk but as I mentioned

459
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,539
I I really liked it so so I'm gonna keep

460
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,059
using it in the future

461
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,760
but here you see how we modeled

462
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,440
um a potential Cloud architecture in

463
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
archimate so you see we have a business

464
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,900
process so we we can have business

465
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,120
processes that are supported by

466
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,160
applications running in the cloud and

467
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,480
that would then be a SAS service model

468
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,539
we can also just hire a files runtime

469
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,660
and we can use um Azure functions for

470
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,620
example

471
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,900
and run an application in this Azure

472
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,820
function then we are more in the fast

473
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,100
service model

474
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,039
we can just rent a kubernetes cluster

475
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,020
then we're more in the cars

476
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,780
service model we can have a I don't know

477
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,940
a PHP platform I'm not sure if that's

478
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,400
the best example but then you're in pass

479
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,160
or you can just hike or rent out

480
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,340
machines and then you're in an IRS kind

481
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,919
of service model

482
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,860
and so for me this is very useful

483
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,100
because it shows exactly how this is

484
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
built

485
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,360
not linked to Technologies not linked to

486
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,200
to Azure to AWS to Google Cloud

487
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,620
it's just conceptually what makes up a

488
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,320
cloud architecture and so why did we use

489
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,600
archimate again because this is

490
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
not so easy to do in order notations so

491
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,080
we make the link here between

492
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,640
infrastructure architecture to

493
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
application architecture to business

494
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,080
process architecture

495
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,600
it's not easy to to have this link in

496
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,640
other notations and it is the de facto

497
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,980
standard as I mentioned

498
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
in many of the companies that I was able

499
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,299
to work with this is the standard to

500
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,000
actually model this kind of uh of

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,640
problems

502
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,100
I also have a nice statement by the way

503
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,720
of Nick Malik at the time when he was

504
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,260
working for for Microsoft where and

505
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,820
there's a lot of Truth in this statement

506
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,039
and that's also what because sometimes

507
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,360
people ask me what's the difference

508
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,640
between uml for example and archery why

509
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,100
do we need to use archimate I think it's

510
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,020
and there I agree with with what Nick

511
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,900
Malik mentions it's just a difference in

512
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,660
in what we want to describe in archimate

513
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,940
we can describe the form

514
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,100
an entire organization

515
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,200
whereas you need uml for the more

516
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,559
detailed design the single solutions

517
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,600
that you want to design like sequence

518
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
diagrams State diagrams all of these

519
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
things they're very important if you

520
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,700
focus on one single solution and both

521
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,280
are indeed needed so it's not that the

522
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,559
one replaces the other

523
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,620
not at all

524
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,840
so Step One is done we have a model we

525
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,200
have an architectural model in archimate

526
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,140
and here you see again these different

527
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,360
service models so you see that that was

528
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,240
a bit caught up in in this because again

529
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,220
I I think it's it's useful for the

530
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,559
future as well it's just a shared

531
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,659
responsibility model but then modeled in

532
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,900
archimate conceptually not by Microsoft

533
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,240
not by any other vendor but just a

534
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,000
conceptual model that that we could use

535
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,100
in this threat model exercise

536
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,260
so okay then we are at step two and now

537
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,140
we can identify threats uh we just

538
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,700
follow the methodology

539
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,460
and we always start with trade actors

540
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,559
but trade actives it's not the core of

541
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,059
this talk I want to focus on threat

542
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,179
events uh in this talk but anyway we

543
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,760
need to or we cannot ignore trade actors

544
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,559
so here I gave some examples of

545
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
Potential Threat actors

546
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,580
and I really like the open security

547
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,380
architecture

548
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,700
um

549
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,220
threat classification methods

550
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,400
it's to classify threats not just threat

551
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,700
actors but thanks to to to actually this

552
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,460
method we can also apply it to the

553
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,500
threat actors so for example we have

554
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,419
internal threat actors we have external

555
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,400
threat actors some of them can be

556
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
[Music]

557
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,820
um

558
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,460
can really be deliberately attempting to

559
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,520
attack our organization some of them can

560
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,500
actually just well they can make an

561
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,780
accident which also has impact to

562
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,760
organization

563
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,980
and we can also have some more Fox

564
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,620
measure uh kind of of threats Like An

565
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,659
Earthquake perhaps or or something like

566
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:28,799
that

567
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,080
so these are threat actors very

568
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,840
important to to think about is is the

569
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,059
NSA you're threat actor

570
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,280
is it the hobby attack is it the

571
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,440
internal employee that's all very

572
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,480
important it can even lead to some some

573
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,260
red teaming scenarios Etc based on who

574
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,780
are you afraid of or who

575
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,980
um do you think maybe attacking you

576
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,600
foreign

577
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,940
but now we move to actually the core

578
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,460
slide of what I want to show and again I

579
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,620
will also attempt to to show it a bit in

580
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,559
in a demo kind of way but here you

581
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,299
already see it and there's a lot of on

582
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,559
this slide

583
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,600
but what is what is shown here is

584
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,760
actually the end result of a threat

585
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
model session

586
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,020
so what you see here and I'm circling it

587
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,080
I hope you see my my laser pointer

588
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,760
what you see here is is our Cloud

589
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,400
architecture the infrastructure layer

590
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,780
the application layer the business

591
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,220
process layer

592
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,260
we have here the service models that's

593
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,780
what we discussed a couple of slides ago

594
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,600
and on the right we have the threads

595
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,299
which are the result of a threat session

596
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,120
so I could have a threat session with

597
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,860
with Matas and we come up with all of

598
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,559
these threats and we link them to a

599
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,260
certain component a certain element in

600
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,299
this architecture

601
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,700
so that we actually know which threads

602
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,799
apply depending on which service model

603
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,440
that you use you see also that there are

604
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,240
some common threads by the way here in

605
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,640
the system thread profile that apply to

606
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,000
any kind of system but okay let's let's

607
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,820
ignore these for now

608
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,220
how did we come to these threats because

609
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,980
again there is not much difference could

610
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,679
we have used stride perhaps we could but

611
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,419
the thing that I don't like about stride

612
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,620
is that it's

613
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,720
too open and some people actually like

614
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,100
it because it's open and because you

615
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,140
have to spark creativity and you have to

616
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,659
indeed uh be able to to have a

617
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,220
brainstorming session

618
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,799
but in reality if I really have to do it

619
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,860
consistently across different

620
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,539
architectural e Enterprise architectural

621
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,299
projects I think it's good to have some

622
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,000
kind of threat catalog a reference that

623
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,840
we that we use

624
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,059
a very a very good resource for

625
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,980
architectural treatment that we found is

626
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,320
the carpet mechanisms of attack and I

627
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,779
will show you that also during the the

628
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,880
short demo

629
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,240
it's a miter resource so we all know

630
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,059
miter from uh the miter attack framework

631
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,200
I guess but they also have a Copic a

632
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
common attack pattern enumeration

633
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,860
um

634
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,320
and classification where they actually

635
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,059
categorize all the threats that they

636
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,159
also have in the attack framework in

637
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,640
some kind of patterns meta patterns meta

638
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,640
patterns that we can very well use in an

639
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,279
architectural threat model session I'll

640
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,500
show you that list later we can

641
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,419
optionally cross-reference it with the

642
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,480
cowboy catalog then if we have time I

643
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,679
could show you that that's just a paper

644
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,140
where somebody actually made the effort

645
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,559
already to go to garlic through all of

646
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,520
the attack patterns of carpec and filter

647
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,659
out the ones that are more Enterprise

648
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,120
architecture related so

649
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,760
let's say that Cape mentions the sea

650
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,380
surf attack here which is actually an

651
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,480
attack so attack threats some people

652
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,159
would like to also have a discussion

653
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,200
maybe a discussion we have at the end of

654
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,460
this session

655
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,679
with a sea surf attack to me should not

656
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,960
be a threat that we model in an

657
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,600
architectural trap model session we

658
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,159
should more talk about

659
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,240
um a higher level meta patterns and

660
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,159
that's what we're gonna do with the

661
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,740
cowboy paper actually already does that

662
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,900
for you so they have made a list of

663
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,539
filters list of Copic which they think

664
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:31,740
is important at an architectural level

665
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,240
and of course as we always do with

666
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,860
thread mobileing we have to analyze the

667
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,279
threat in the context of this model

668
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,559
what you perhaps also see here but again

669
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,779
I will show it also in in origin then we

670
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,480
can dive a bit deeper into it is that we

671
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,700
linked multiple threads to thread

672
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,600
profiles just to make it a bit more

673
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,260
um

674
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,900
uh well to make the overview a bit more

675
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,419
clear so that we don't have to link all

676
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,520
of these threads to to single elements

677
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,139
in the cloud architectural model

678
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,380
so again at this for me is is a core

679
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,900
deliverable of Enterprise architecture

680
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,539
why because now you can say okay we have

681
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,820
and we will come to the controls in a

682
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,320
minute

683
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,840
but now you can say okay if I am doing

684
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,220
paths

685
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,220
well then these are the threats so all

686
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,220
the ones below pass all of these threats

687
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,480
should be solved by my cloud provider

688
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,240
are they solved you should check it and

689
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,460
either it's contractually agreed I know

690
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,039
it's difficult with with the big players

691
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,919
like Azure and Amazon you're not always

692
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,799
in the position to to negotiate but

693
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,539
anyway you should be aware of these

694
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,600
threats and you should at least document

695
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,059
that it is assumed or that it is known

696
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,919
that these threats are in fact mitigated

697
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,760
by our or by your Cloud profile

698
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,039
all of the ones on top of it so if you

699
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,200
go for past all of these threats that

700
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,059
are uh above the paths line should be

701
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,679
solved by you should be controlled by

702
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,140
you and so this is ideal to come up with

703
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,640
some controls Some Cloud security

704
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,860
controls and we have Cloud controls made

705
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,480
wishes of course we have Anisa top 10.

706
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,340
they should be aligned with each other

707
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,440
and these are the threats that we need

708
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,650
to protect against

709
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,960
[Music]

710
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,120
common Enterprise architectural level

711
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,679
step three then is to actually control

712
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,679
them to to identify controls and this is

713
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,039
a step that was not completed here in

714
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,140
this presentation because I want to

715
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,299
focus on the threat identification and

716
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,740
that's what threat modeling is about

717
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,899
identify the threats of course in the

718
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,240
end you should end up with a set of

719
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,059
controls that you have to apply that was

720
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,200
not the main goal of this talk

721
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,120
so what you see here is that the purple

722
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,460
things are actually the control profiles

723
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,320
so for each thread profile we have a

724
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,659
control profile but you see that I only

725
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,720
identified two concrete controls just in

726
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,720
this example uh where we have controls

727
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,000
that are actually attempting to mitigate

728
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,940
some of these threats bundled together

729
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,500
in a control profile

730
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,460
this is what I mentioned so depending on

731
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,020
the service model that we choose or that

732
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,820
you choose either you or the service

733
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,980
provider will be responsible to actually

734
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,100
make sure these controls are in place

735
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,620
and the threat actors are also not seen

736
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,260
here why because well in this this is

737
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,659
actually a compression exercise so we

738
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,360
compare paths with ERS and cars Etc to

739
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,159
retract active scan shift if you go for

740
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,220
on-prem you do not need to worry about a

741
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,460
cloud administrator for example so

742
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,580
that's why they shift in this example

743
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,960
now okay enough enough of the of the

744
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,779
talk let's let's just show some examples

745
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,860
because I think it's it's very useful

746
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,840
um and I I want to start from the Copic

747
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,640
mechanisms just to show you that and

748
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,279
perhaps some of you already know it but

749
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,039
so I have the Copic

750
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,140
mechanisms of attack so it's just a

751
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,140
resource of miter as I mentioned

752
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,899
and what's very important or very useful

753
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:25,020
is that they actually have categories so

754
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,299
the C is a category

755
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,580
It's actually an attack category it's

756
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,399
more categorized based on intent but

757
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,860
okay it's very useful to have this

758
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,559
for what's even more useful is these

759
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,500
meta attack patterns this is what we

760
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,020
need at an architectural level

761
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,779
so for example bypassing physical

762
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,840
security is a meta attacker pattern I'm

763
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,760
not sure if you can you can read it it's

764
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,120
pretty small but I will quote meta level

765
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,340
attack patterns are particularly useful

766
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,500
for architectural threats modeling

767
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,260
exercises that's what we what we need it

768
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,260
for and that's what we use it for indeed

769
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,059
in this talk

770
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,640
if you even click further you go to the

771
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,620
standard attack pattern and these for me

772
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,580
are too detailed so that's useful in a

773
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,799
solution thread model session perhaps

774
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,039
but it's too detailed in a architectural

775
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,380
threat modeling session

776
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,480
so I really like these mechanisms of

777
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,020
attack and especially these meta attack

778
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,620
patterns for Midday makeup the thread

779
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,000
catalog

780
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,039
the standard thread catalog for many

781
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,220
organizations out there

782
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,140
and so you can build your own credit

783
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,419
catalog but I think a miter is very

784
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,580
known and perhaps it the site is it's

785
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,919
not doesn't look like like uh the most

786
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,159
modern one but the content is great uh

787
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,380
of of this of this list

788
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,360
now what we usually do and and that's

789
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,460
something that that I should add

790
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,059
is actually you see an Excel here I will

791
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,240
zoom in just a tiny bit

792
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,159
in column F you see these meta attack

793
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,799
patterns but what we usually do is okay

794
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,919
we still translate them here in column D

795
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,460
to a more uh to a threat in our own

796
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,600
wording

797
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
because it may be easier to manage

798
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,419
definitions yourself and to make sure

799
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,880
they align with with definitions of of

800
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,460
the company that you work in

801
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,980
rather than actually reusing directly

802
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,960
The Meta attack pattern definitions

803
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,580
because there may sometimes be

804
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,799
differences in opinion or differences in

805
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,919
in in Concepts that uh that Copic is

806
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,039
using uh in contrast to what you're

807
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,679
using in your organization so usually we

808
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,919
we translate them still to a trip

809
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,840
um and sometimes even we split them so

810
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,640
flooding in the context of cloud it's

811
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,919
not just needles but it's also that your

812
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,779
that your resources can be exhausted

813
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,019
that you perhaps chose a machine that is

814
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,480
too lightweight can also be a threat to

815
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,640
to availability

816
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,620
and so that's just a simple translation

817
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,299
you don't need to do it you can use the

818
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,460
meta attack patterns directly but that's

819
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,918
what we like to do here by the way I

820
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,300
will come back because you see that

821
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,839
there is no meta attack pattern linked

822
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,300
and this Excel so I'm gonna switch to

823
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,500
the RG

824
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,199
tool now

825
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,418
these patterns and I hope it's large

826
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,520
enough but I will I will also just

827
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,040
explain what's on the screen

828
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,080
all of the threats that you saw in the

829
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,599
Excel are also returning here so I just

830
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,359
imported them from the Excel into my

831
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,040
architectural threat model

832
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,260
in your organization if you have a

833
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,300
common repository of architectural

834
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,119
artifacts these threats could be part of

835
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,418
your common Repository

836
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,460
and it's these threat events that we can

837
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,460
actually easily link to some kind of

838
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,359
elements so let me just show you a very

839
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,460
quick demo because the cloud example was

840
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,240
perhaps a bit too big for some of you to

841
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,440
see

842
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,660
for example if imagine that we need

843
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,180
locking components and and I'm not going

844
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,820
to talk about tooling so we're at the

845
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,740
end of Chrysler architectural level

846
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,420
let's say that we need to introduce a

847
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,640
login component it's it's an application

848
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,680
component

849
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,480
and we want to thread model it so we

850
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,460
organize a session uh with with

851
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,240
architects and we use the Copic threat

852
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,359
catalog and we actually say okay I guess

853
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,280
that for these this logging system well

854
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,619
traffic can be intercepted perhaps and

855
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,140
so that's a potential threat to the

856
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,040
login component I link it I usually use

857
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,260
the association relationships we can we

858
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,480
can have a discussion on it but anyway

859
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,579
it's it's a potential

860
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:57,060
uh to it or an easy one uh loss of

861
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,880
compromise uh or loss or compromise of

862
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,660
looks okay I also link it to this

863
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,700
component

864
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,980
and then of course we we have to to

865
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,200
follow our meta model by the way so this

866
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,820
this actually is following our meta

867
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,760
model and I have a small script as well

868
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,220
that actually

869
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,859
sets some properties on these relations

870
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,320
why because again I think we need to

871
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,020
move to a more strict methodology a more

872
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,700
stricter approach to to this

873
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,040
architectural threat modeling and you

874
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,920
see that I now added properties of

875
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,660
likelihood and impacts of this threat

876
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,240
so for example at the interception of

877
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,760
traffic it's a likely threat with a

878
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,740
medium impact I don't know it's just an

879
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,560
example and we can even add some context

880
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,599
traffic

881
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,440
um

882
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,520
looks going to the logic component you

883
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,680
can easily or can be intercepted

884
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:03,359
may have a medium impact because of

885
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,480
the content

886
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,780
of Dropbox just a quick example

887
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,339
and so that's

888
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,160
how we document our entire threat model

889
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,640
in this architectural model and of

890
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,320
course the next step is then to start

891
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,900
defining controls so that was step three

892
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,940
let's identify good tools by the way I

893
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,579
skipped the threat active phase

894
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,560
but in this case let's say we have an

895
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,839
internal malicious employee

896
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:35,820
with uh possibly initiating these threat

897
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,859
events and then we can have some some

898
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,839
requirements where we can protect

899
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,780
logging data in transit

900
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,119
and according to the meta model that's

901
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,700
an implicit relation I can also link it

902
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,339
directly to this connection not to the

903
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,339
thread because depending on the context

904
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,220
the the control can be different so it's

905
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,780
not that the control solves the entire

906
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,099
threat you typically need to

907
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,079
contextualized

908
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,980
um uh control to actually solve this

909
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,740
thread or mitigate this trick

910
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,839
and this is an easy

911
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,359
um a threat model so it's similar to the

912
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,880
one of the clouds we can even have some

913
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,859
some other controls for this

914
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,079
the compromise of locks I don't know

915
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,540
require authentication okay this is not

916
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,980
ready

917
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,880
create this treadmill of my life but you

918
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,560
see the point where we actually add

919
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,780
controls in step 3 to this threats model

920
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,400
and that's just the approach that I

921
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,400
would like to to to get more accustomed

922
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
to to have this more strict method and

923
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,099
what's great is that typically we also

924
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,980
need to generate a traceability matrix

925
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,300
well

926
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,900
uh we can use scripting in Archie

927
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,140
to actually generate Auto generate these

928
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,640
threats

929
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,980
traceability Matrix

930
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,079
sorry I will show it again

931
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,940
so I just ran the script and then it

932
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,579
copies all of this information to the

933
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,740
clipboard and you see here that we have

934
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,300
the login component with two threads

935
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,460
and also we have for each thread a

936
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,359
control that was identified

937
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,599
we could even use this to assess disk

938
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,579
because now we have the likelihoods

939
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,680
that's typically related to thread but

940
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,300
we can also have the impact that's what

941
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,359
I added on these connections because the

942
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,280
login component it may have a medium

943
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,500
impact so we could actually use this as

944
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,440
well to move to risks and then we have

945
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,720
the full meta model

946
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,660
let's see if I still have it here then

947
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,359
we can actually start building this meta

948
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,520
model concretely

949
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,160
um uh in in this this example of the

950
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,000
logging component

951
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,140
okay so

952
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,119
um just as uh

953
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,480
final example I will show this threat

954
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,820
model of the cloud again so it's exactly

955
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,740
the same and we have these elements and

956
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,400
I linked threads to the elements to a

957
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,020
control profile or sorry a thread

958
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,880
profile doesn't really matter and we

959
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,280
could also have linked them directly

960
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
which is exactly what we also did here

961
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,800
in this logging component example

962
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,020
so I hope it's a bit clearer but this is

963
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,480
actually what we present

964
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,740
and of course this is architectural

965
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,660
threat modeling as we see it let me

966
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,578
switch back to the slides

967
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,020
so okay we've done a lot there so um

968
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,119
start from the Copic mechanisms

969
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,280
I've shown you that so not going to

970
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,099
repeat it I told you that the meta

971
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,320
patterns is actually what we need in an

972
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,859
architectural threat modeling session

973
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:57,780
but the standard patterns they can be

974
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,780
still very useful in a more detailed

975
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,220
solution threat model

976
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,079
here I also used Archie had to to

977
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,420
actually do this in practice so it

978
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,400
doesn't have to be RT but it's an open

979
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,820
source tool again used in in many

980
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,680
Enterprise but can also be Sparks or

981
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,359
whatever

982
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:21,240
and I auto generated this traceability

983
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,500
Matrix

984
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,079
from the model which is great for

985
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,599
documentation and which immediately can

986
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,880
show you okay we have no controls for

987
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,859
all of these threats

988
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,859
but that's the problem because if I take

989
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,380
for example EOS I'm actually responsible

990
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,260
for all of these controls so we have to

991
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,000
Define these genetic controls perhaps

992
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,579
even principles and objectives to make

993
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,280
sure that we make the correct choice and

994
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,820
that we treat these these these cloud

995
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,859
service models securely

996
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,380
so okay a lot of talking it's it's

997
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,660
always a bit strange to not see your

998
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,760
audience or to not get uh get immediate

999
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,339
feedback but uh let me jump to the to

1000
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,079
the conclusions

1001
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,300
um and some of the potential pitfalls

1002
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,160
that you can also face

1003
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,980
Helen I think I still have some time to

1004
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,320
to First with these conclusions

1005
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,980
correct for the Q a so far no questions

1006
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,400
so uh the audience can uh

1007
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,119
can not be afraid to prepare questions

1008
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,859
will have enough time back to you

1009
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,680
Michael thanks thanks so yeah indeed to

1010
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,260
ask us questions it's uh it's great I

1011
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,200
think to to have this kind of uh

1012
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,180
interactive sessions but so the main

1013
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,220
conclusions so in this talk I focused on

1014
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,859
on the layering uh so most on the

1015
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:47,220
architectural uh leg actually

1016
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,660
where we said okay this is also

1017
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,200
supported by toga by subsa by zachman

1018
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,020
and all the like where we now focus on

1019
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,240
the contextual conceptual logical lists

1020
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,579
whereas typical solution thread modeling

1021
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,420
is more focusing on the bottom layers

1022
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,640
but a question that I that I get often

1023
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,380
and that I also

1024
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,680
often think about is what exactly is

1025
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,480
difference with solution threat modeling

1026
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,920
and with the threat modeling as we know

1027
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,819
it

1028
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,200
and

1029
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,720
I think the main differences are in the

1030
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,000
Scopes and the goals of what we want to

1031
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,280
do with architectural clip modeling and

1032
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,020
because the scope and these goals are

1033
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,599
different we must move to other

1034
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,980
techniques

1035
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,020
we must move to other notations

1036
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,380
to be able to link it to an Enterprise

1037
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,880
Architects doing in their day-to-day

1038
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,980
jobs

1039
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,920
so to summarize the methodology is I

1040
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,780
think similar

1041
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,760
I would love to have it a bit strict and

1042
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,440
that's also what what is presented here

1043
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,480
it's it's it's not a free-for-all

1044
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,359
anymore it's more strict

1045
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:55,619
and I think it's also different

1046
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,260
techniques that we use archimed dogaf

1047
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,540
again actually you could do this also

1048
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,420
with other notations but again I think

1049
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,079
we should attempt to to standardize as

1050
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,000
much as possible

1051
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,180
also in the Copic library of Might are

1052
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,680
very thankful

1053
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,319
resources that you can use in practice

1054
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,180
and for the controls again that was not

1055
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,040
the focus of this talk but I think since

1056
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,560
we have here I showed you how we can

1057
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,380
automate this generation of of threats

1058
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,619
of traceability matrices perhaps we can

1059
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,720
even automate the generation of controls

1060
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,099
in the future

1061
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,160
looking at Oscar uh I'm not sure if if

1062
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,319
any of you have worked with it but it's

1063
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,940
also a way to to actually represent

1064
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,940
controls in a more computer readable

1065
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,060
language you could say so it may be

1066
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,859
possible to actually start integrating

1067
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:53,099
with that automatically as well

1068
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,200
perhaps to talk for a couple in a couple

1069
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
of years

1070
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,520
again for me the main differences is the

1071
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,260
scope so we focus here on Enterprise

1072
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,180
architecture deliverables we're not

1073
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,700
focusing on detailed design what do I

1074
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,440
mean with Enterprise architecture

1075
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,240
deliverables it's reference or

1076
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,220
architectures it's it's architectural

1077
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,339
patterns that we actually want to assess

1078
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,240
that we want to threat model before we

1079
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,640
validate them for use

1080
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,900
for genetic use in an Enterprise

1081
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,240
the goals are also different the goals

1082
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,400
from architectural technology to me they

1083
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,140
are defining security principles

1084
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,420
objectives directly linked to the

1085
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,680
business attributes where it all starts

1086
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,480
we also need some traceability as

1087
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,760
sometimes people may ask you hey but why

1088
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,920
do we have this detailed security

1089
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,720
requirement

1090
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,560
um

1091
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,859
for example of having to to to be to be

1092
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:53,400
re-authenticated after 30 minutes well

1093
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,960
you should be able to use the

1094
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,579
architectural clip models to actually

1095
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,160
jump from the from the deep down

1096
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,119
security requirement to the objective

1097
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,260
principles the goals that we want to

1098
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,359
achieve

1099
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:09,359
and so I hope that with this talk I

1100
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,040
showed you how we can facilitate threat

1101
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,540
modeling for Enterprise security

1102
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,359
Architects that was the main goal that's

1103
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,480
how we also use it and I think it's it's

1104
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,380
it's very useful uh like that

1105
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,660
last slide uh Alan and then let's see if

1106
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,160
there are some questions in the meantime

1107
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,319
but some common some common pitfalls to

1108
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,780
avoid so so we have run into some some

1109
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,940
of these uh ourselves so to save you

1110
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,260
from them

1111
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,420
I think it's important to try to avoid

1112
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,359
these and and an example is the

1113
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,920
overlapping threats

1114
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,200
depending on the catalogs that you use

1115
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,300
you can have many overlapping threats

1116
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,240
some threads they actually are the same

1117
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,280
as another one

1118
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,500
but try to avoid it by tracking related

1119
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,060
threads so if you really want to use

1120
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,099
multiple resources topic and perhaps

1121
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,140
extend it with some other threats

1122
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,619
catalogs try to identify the related

1123
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,200
threats up front

1124
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,119
I'm not going to go over all of them but

1125
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,220
but one another one that I think is very

1126
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,660
important is missing threads so in Copic

1127
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,119
Copic is based on Attack on attacks

1128
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,040
but there are threats which are not

1129
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,720
necessarily always linked to an attack

1130
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,960
for me in an attack is kind of a subset

1131
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,640
of of threats

1132
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,740
but they're also non-attacked threats

1133
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,140
like and all that calls them more

1134
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,000
technology threats and the fox major

1135
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,380
threats

1136
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,540
that's also what you saw in my Excel

1137
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,300
list where there was no link to a Copic

1138
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,380
threat

1139
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,200
well those are mentioned here and you

1140
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,640
should be aware of them and you should

1141
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,240
not ignore them but in practice I think

1142
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
it's usually a limited set of threads

1143
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,859
that you can also build up front

1144
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:56,119
and adds to your thread catalog

1145
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,859
independently of the Copic threats

1146
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,660
um the last one that I want to to

1147
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,599
mention is the paralysis by analysis uh

1148
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,819
uh kind of uh I'm not sure if I can call

1149
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,420
it the theorem but we as or you as

1150
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,060
Security Experts we typically have a

1151
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,520
good understanding of Technology

1152
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,680
and we want to analyze things more and

1153
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,140
more in depth but we should attempt to

1154
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,300
especially in architectural cut modeling

1155
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,520
we should attempt to avoid that by

1156
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,720
communicating also with the business

1157
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,160
business-minded people who will actually

1158
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,560
be able to tell you what did what they

1159
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,599
see as a problem and and then we touch

1160
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,359
on the sub business attributes which is

1161
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,400
uh perhaps for for a lot of talk as well

1162
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,040
but that's something to watch out for

1163
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,020
sometimes you have to say okay we have

1164
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,500
these threats they may not be 100

1165
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,680
exhaustive they may not always be 100

1166
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,359
correct even but we have the threats

1167
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,300
let's now start defining the controls so

1168
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,220
that we end up with some principles that

1169
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,510
we can use in practice

1170
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,420
[Music]

1171
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,599
so thanks so here you see my bio I'm not

1172
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,780
gonna go over it but I'm curious to see

1173
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,000
Ellen if we have some questions in the

1174
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,260
meantime

1175
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,900
yes so uh there were two questions that

1176
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,099
came in

1177
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,800
the topic was layered threat modeling

1178
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,300
and the question is

1179
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,440
solution threats modeling versus

1180
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,300
architectural I suppose Enterprise

1181
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,060
threat modeling yeah we presented the

1182
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,940
two at the beginning so the net net is

1183
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,200
can these be done or should they be done

1184
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,079
independently or in conjunction

1185
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,359
uh well that's that's indeed a good

1186
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,280
question and I think it's

1187
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,740
it depends a bit but I don't think they

1188
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,660
always should be done in conjunction I

1189
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,460
think you can see them in details as

1190
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,960
different layers

1191
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,359
and typically in Enterprise architecture

1192
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,380
you store with reference or

1193
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,300
architectures with patterns Etc and

1194
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,220
those ones you can model you can thread

1195
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,060
model

1196
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,640
and the solutions there can be many

1197
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,380
solutions making use of similar

1198
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,880
reference or architectures and for all

1199
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,740
of these Solutions you you should be

1200
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,560
doing solution thread modeling but they

1201
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,180
can refer back to a similar

1202
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,839
architectural cut model session in which

1203
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,940
the reference architecture was was

1204
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,160
assessed

1205
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,500
okay thank you then the second question

1206
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,099
has to do uh is the following is the

1207
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,940
approach presented tooling dependent

1208
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,760
or is it compatible with over tooling

1209
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,119
like Sparks systems

1210
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,579
yeah well so so here I

1211
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,220
um I've shown I showed you indeed uh

1212
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,500
Archie and because it's open source it's

1213
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,839
it's easy to use

1214
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm not saying that that the tool is

1215
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,920
fully Enterprise ready so indeed Sports

1216
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,619
and and mega or whatever all the tools

1217
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,020
they may be a bit more Enterprise ready

1218
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,059
because they have a shared Repository

1219
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,980
but I don't think it matters that much

1220
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,220
so okay we have some scripts that we use

1221
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,059
to export this table automatically it's

1222
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:07,980
not that that you cannot do this in

1223
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,619
other tooling so it's not not tooling

1224
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,200
dependent no you can you can use this

1225
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,480
approach in any kind of tool that you

1226
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,540
use for Enterprise architecture

1227
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,800
okay

1228
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,980
thank you

1229
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,619
[Music]

1230
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:23,160
um

1231
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,500
the audience are there any we still have

1232
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,380
a bit of time here uh we had 10 minutes

1233
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,420
before the end of the session

1234
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,300
are there any other questions or

1235
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,780
comments

1236
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,680
I think you have to use the Hoover

1237
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,700
platform but uh

1238
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,300
I can also take a look at the Rover yeah

1239
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,819
they should be coming in

1240
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,480
foreign

1241
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,319
[Music]

1242
00:51:57,319 --> 00:51:59,700
platform Ellen I'm not sure if you see

1243
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,500
them

1244
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,420
probably I didn't

1245
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,819
so so let me go over them because indeed

1246
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,800
I see some questions and we still have a

1247
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,040
couple of minutes yes so

1248
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,420
um I see the first question here how

1249
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,099
often do Enterprise threat models get

1250
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,020
updated what are the triggers how do

1251
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,400
changes get propagated towards the

1252
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,859
solution level well very good question

1253
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:22,200
and and and that's um I'm not sure that

1254
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,460
I will be able to answer that

1255
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,359
immediately it's as usual it depends but

1256
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,240
what what we found as as something that

1257
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,579
that may work

1258
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:34,559
um is actually to to at least review

1259
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,960
them manually uh perhaps that's that's

1260
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,579
normal

1261
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:41,640
um and the triggers are typically if you

1262
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,680
start seeing that things start to go

1263
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,040
wrong so that's where you have to where

1264
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,900
you need a feedback loop if you start

1265
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,000
seeing that during your penetration

1266
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,520
testing during your red teaming you we

1267
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,059
start missing more and more threats or

1268
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:58,260
there are more and more successful

1269
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,880
attacks perhaps from your bug Bounty

1270
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,780
platform

1271
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,059
they should actually feedback

1272
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,280
to the Enterprise architecture level

1273
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,440
where we say okay this capability it

1274
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,119
seems to be missing yeah because we keep

1275
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,579
on having problems there so let's start

1276
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:14,099
focusing perhaps we need a new reference

1277
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:17,280
or architecture on uh whatever component

1278
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,660
that we use

1279
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,880
so kind of a high level answer I

1280
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,559
realized that but this is also a very

1281
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,660
difficult question to answer but I guess

1282
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,339
if you have the correct feedback loop

1283
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,380
that's very important and that can be

1284
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,760
one input

1285
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,700
to know when you should be updating some

1286
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,920
of the threat models that you already

1287
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,540
have in your organization

1288
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,880
um let's see

1289
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,640
how do you create modeling

1290
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,880
out of existing big applications I'm not

1291
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,280
sure if I if I understand the question

1292
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,960
entirely

1293
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,059
I'm also not going to interpret it so

1294
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:56,839
for the person who asked it if you can

1295
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:59,099
elaborate it a bit

1296
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,380
I will come back to it

1297
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,359
can you recommend certification material

1298
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,960
for architectural threat modeling well

1299
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,240
of course our teammate I think is is key

1300
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,760
and I don't want to well I actually like

1301
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,319
archimate but there may be other

1302
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:14,579
notations

1303
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,980
but you can get certified in archimate I

1304
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,059
think that's

1305
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,099
that's an important prerequisite that

1306
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,740
you need to know the notation that you

1307
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,440
are using

1308
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,660
but for the rest

1309
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,859
there are not many threat modeling

1310
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:30,960
certifications that I know of there are

1311
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,119
many good books so I think you should

1312
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,220
always start also from the solution

1313
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,960
threat modeling and the Book of Adam

1314
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,599
showstack For example is is a no-brainer

1315
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,859
to to read you should be reading it

1316
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:45,900
but I don't know any uh certification

1317
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,059
material official certification for

1318
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,800
really architectural threat modeling

1319
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,040
maybe an ID to to start with it to the

1320
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,260
person who asked it

1321
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,059
there's a tool and methodology you

1322
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:59,819
described work for non-architecture as

1323
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:02,760
well yes of course yes so this was just

1324
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,920
an example

1325
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,920
um that I created for this talk

1326
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,059
uh again I'm gonna keep using it but

1327
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,680
this was just an example that I created

1328
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,380
but you can apply it also to non-cloud

1329
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,720
architectures for sure you also have

1330
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,520
non-cloud reference architectures

1331
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,280
perhaps on your uh on your API stuff

1332
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,040
with with gateways and and controls that

1333
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,680
you want at microservice level or

1334
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,020
perhaps at Gateway level

1335
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,599
that's for me also an Enterprise

1336
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:35,000
architectural

1337
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,619
discussion a reference architecture that

1338
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,220
you need without regardless whether it's

1339
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,740
cloud or not so so yes of course this

1340
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,480
should also work for non-cloud

1341
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,260
architectures

1342
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,160
um

1343
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,260
will architectural threat modeling free

1344
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,740
myself from solution to it modeling no

1345
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:59,400
not at all so this is two independent

1346
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,740
things with two different goals it's

1347
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,859
very important to do both but as as was

1348
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:07,260
discussing in the first question

1349
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,440
well you do not necessarily for each

1350
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,359
solution have to do architectural cat

1351
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:15,420
modeling and you can probably reuse

1352
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,079
um for many solutions the same reference

1353
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,599
architecture the same reference better

1354
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,640
so short short answer to the question no

1355
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,160
you still meet solution threat modeling

1356
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,660
are there any open and similar

1357
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,819
alternatives to Archie that are hosted

1358
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:36,540
or automatable well a very good question

1359
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,940
there are many alternatives to Archie

1360
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,800
but most of them are pretty expensive

1361
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,780
Sparks is I think the the most known one

1362
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,180
that Alan also mentioned in one of the

1363
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,359
questions

1364
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,059
and they are hosted I'm not sure if you

1365
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:56,760
mean Cloud hosted or on premise but um

1366
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,980
you I think you can choose with sports

1367
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,260
but I'm not on tooling expert in all of

1368
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,579
the tools

1369
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,520
um but there are many architectural well

1370
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,319
there are many alternative toolings that

1371
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,359
you can use to to actually model

1372
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,500
archimate archimate is a notation RT is

1373
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,599
just one of the tools that you can use

1374
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,180
to build ultimate models

1375
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,800
the existing application is complex and

1376
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,480
not sure from where to start to create

1377
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,480
modeling I guess that's related to the

1378
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,559
question that I did not understand

1379
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,420
completely

1380
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,680
um

1381
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,640
uh

1382
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,040
but yeah for me that's actually a

1383
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,839
question about architecture so if you

1384
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,640
start from an existing application it's

1385
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,559
typically easier to start with the with

1386
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:46,559
the with the structure what application

1387
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,559
do you have a structure it's it's a

1388
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,960
kind of a definition in Archie or

1389
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,520
teammate

1390
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,859
but if you allow me I will skip this

1391
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:58,500
question in interest of time I see that

1392
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,260
there is one more uh we have one minute

1393
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,220
left

1394
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,339
Engineers developers not to use RT or

1395
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,440
uml

1396
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,839
these days preferring light modeling

1397
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,240
here the cloud providers don't use it in

1398
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,339
their architecture material as far as I

1399
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:16,559
know does a heavy tool like Archie Arch

1400
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,680
mate alienate Engineers developers given

1401
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,200
the learning curve oh this is a very

1402
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,119
nice question

1403
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,319
um

1404
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,059
I think we need something and again

1405
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:28,619
that's why we have these lyrics I don't

1406
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:30,660
say that developers need to create these

1407
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,540
models I still think even in the agile

1408
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,000
world we have several roles to play and

1409
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,859
we have Empire or people working at the

1410
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:40,260
Enterprise architecture level who can

1411
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,420
use Archie and Archie mate

1412
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,880
but indeed they should be translated to

1413
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,339
some detailed design models that

1414
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:50,280
developers use slash generate

1415
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,680
so I have never said and I don't want to

1416
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,900
say although it may be nice in the shift

1417
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,140
left approach that developers should be

1418
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,359
actually modeling or creating these

1419
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:03,059
models and I'm sorry but this is an

1420
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:04,500
interesting question but I guess we've

1421
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,140
run out of time

1422
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,220
we are running out of time would you

1423
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,500
like just to use the last 30 seconds to

1424
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,480
maybe summarize with one cookie message

1425
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,040
um well I guess the the main the key

1426
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,079
message is here so keep on doing the

1427
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,760
solution tweet modeling that's what's

1428
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,160
related to the question but also start

1429
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,839
thinking about architectural threat

1430
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:28,500
modeling uh and and hopefully you can

1431
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,119
use some of the material that was

1432
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,400
presented here I can definitely share

1433
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,680
some of it as well I will see how I do

1434
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,079
it but then you will uh you will see it

1435
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:39,900
also in the roof application

1436
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,420
okay thank you Michael we have to close

1437
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,640
now uh there are five concurrent

1438
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,619
sessions that are happening in parallel

1439
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,420
the next session that will be starting

1440
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,079
on this um

1441
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:54,359
this room here will be trusted types A

1442
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:57,839
World Without uh xss

1443
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,839
thank you Michael and all the rest and

1444
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:03,240
see you soon maybe in Belgium thank you

1445
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,979
indeed have a nice day Ellen bye-bye
