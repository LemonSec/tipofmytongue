uh I'll talk a bit about myself before

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,259
uh diving into the uh presentation for

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,960
bug logging tool and what are the recent

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,119
updates which we made

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,640
uh in in the last cycle

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,959
sure so um yeah I'm working with the

55
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,720
marketplace uh segment of Supply

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
Marketplace segment of goget

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,060
gojek is a as Dan mentioned on Demand

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,920
right dealing platform

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,540
and Technology Group based out of

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,599
Indonesia which is responsible for

61
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,060
helping consumers get their food

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,080
delivered

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,420
get a right book a taxi

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,680
etc etc

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
uh Marketplace is responsible for uh

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,599
providing

67
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,060
adequate supply for all the demand Goji

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,739
generates across all the product groups

69
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,280
uh managing Supply managing uh pricing

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
uh managing the allocation engine driver

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,019
incentives

72
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,819
etc etc

73
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,640
so uh we get a decent enough throughput

74
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,040
there we have around 3 million tribal

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,660
Partners sending out their pings every

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,440
10 seconds and uh we do over uh two

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
million uh orders

78
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,860
every month every day

79
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,620
oh all right let's start with the uh

80
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,800
today's presentation uh I'll be talking

81
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,260
about bug locking tool a bug logging

82
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,780
Tool uh it was co-created along with

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,959
Sean uh he is not here today with us

84
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,500
uh so uh yeah what what BLT is uh I'll

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,659
tell you about a brief about what DLT

86
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,580
does and then we can dive deeper into uh

87
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,319
what what are the features which we

88
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,140
provide and how uh we're planning to

89
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,480
uh how is it different from existing uh

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,720
private Community Partners uh like uh

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,720
birth crowd and hackover

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
so a bug logging tool is a tool which

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,220
allows anyone to report an issue uh from

94
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,620
any any web app any website any

95
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,959
application uh which you have

96
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,239
uh it has we are available on multiple

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
platforms so we are available on web

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,440
they're available on mobile Chrome

99
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,220
extension Etc

100
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,060
yeah so what's the problem with uh big

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,180
companies uh so I'll take an angle here

102
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,620
where uh

103
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,738
that there are Partners where the bug

104
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,720
Bounty is actually executed as of today

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,560
but uh but but why do uh we exist uh

106
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,180
I'll take a stab at that

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,880
so uh big companies run bug Bounty

108
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,759
programs and various severity levels but

109
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,040
those are mostly uh exclusive to

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,280
sensitive uh information and uh they

111
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,940
don't generally care about all sort of

112
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,400
advantages and all sort of bugs uh which

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
uh exists as of today and that gets

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,540
unnoticed they might be fixed by uh

115
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,320
these these big players but uh that's

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,080
the the individuals who uh

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,960
who come up with these issues or bugs or

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,940
uh maybe we can call it a vulnerability

119
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,540
uh they get unnoticed and most of the

120
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,479
time uh they take advantage of them uh

121
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,220
if the product is free as it's written

122
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,900
uh you are the product

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,639
right

124
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,919
so how does bug logging tool fix the

125
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,400
issue uh so we crowdsource issues across

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,360
various platforms we users come to a

127
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,340
platform reporter bug they can

128
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,400
cross-link via other platforms report

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,639
the bugs people rate on them uh

130
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,979
organizations are welcome to come uh

131
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,520
approve the product uh approve the bug

132
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,720
which came up uh award bug bounties as

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,180
we usually uh do on these all these

134
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,680
platforms which we already have right

135
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,139
now so if a lot of people are reporting

136
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,539
bugs it's very hard to be ignored and

137
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,419
that gives them visibility uh

138
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,919
so uh why why uh why do we have BLT and

139
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,560
why do we uh what are the features and

140
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,780
what kind of bugs can be reported let's

141
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,400
talk about that

142
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,680
so we currently support several types of

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,960
issues found across the web now I'll

144
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,060
dive into that uh but uh there are a

145
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,520
couple of segments uh where a lot of

146
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,460
bugs are reported we have csrfc we have

147
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,220
SQL injections you know we have uh you

148
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,199
know

149
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,000
optimization related issues we have

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
responsiveness

151
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
basic typos and and everything around

152
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,400
that

153
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,100
now if you look at uh

154
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,680
the the platforms which exists as of

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,340
today uh if they they just take taken

156
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,039
very serious issues and and then they

157
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
don't have options to you know

158
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,100
uh get these kind of issues reported so

159
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,160
it's it's my in my personal experience I

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,100
have been active on hacker one and have

161
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,900
tried reporting several issues I've

162
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,759
talked to a lot of people around this

163
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,940
and such issues are usually uh denied

164
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,060
and they don't get usually approved and

165
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,240
uh it's just a thank you note uh post

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,000
submission of such issues

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,880
so these are the sort of

168
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,340
bug categories which we accept on bug

169
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,000
login to as of now we accept number

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
errors for you know status errors page

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,440
on level availability we accept 5x for

172
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,340
uh

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,400
internal server errors and service

174
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,560
unavailable

175
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,199
something if something is categorized as

176
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,800
four x x 5 x 6 or anything figure that

177
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,440
gets captured as part of number error uh

178
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,560
we have security we accept security

179
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,500
related issues as well so there's a data

180
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,300
leak uh you know if you found something

181
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,759
on the console uh which is which which

182
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,060
was uh not taken care of by devs and you

183
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,259
know if you found something on the

184
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,360
console that can be reported

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,400
uh and and anything around security and

186
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,840
such sensitive information can be part

187
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,860
of security

188
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,560
uh something similar is functional uh

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,599
functional is like if you went to a

190
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,180
let's say an e-commerce and you're not

191
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,460
able to figure out the reviews or the

192
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,740
review section is broken so that can be

193
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,699
part of functional uh bug

194
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,740
uh they can be basic typo related issues

195
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,139
as well so if you have if you see any

196
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,379
type of uh so if you look at any

197
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,479
so let's talk about Wikipedia here so if

198
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,860
you find a typo there you can easily go

199
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,199
and you can edit and that gets uh

200
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,419
changed but let's say if there's a

201
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,799
commercial platform where you find

202
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,958
something similar uh you'll have to go

203
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,700
through a

204
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,179
in a contact Channel top two uh their

205
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,979
team maybe they'll fix it maybe they'll

206
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,779
not nobody cares

207
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,200
uh then we have performance related uh

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,140
problems like High latencies

209
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,620
uh asset not available things around

210
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,800
that so the all these segments are

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
covered under performance and again we

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,140
have design uh so these responsiveness

213
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,779
issues you know buttons not available at

214
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,000
the right place uh the layout is not

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
proper and across devices can be part of

216
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,420
the design

217
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,519
so let's talk about each of them in

218
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,820
detail

219
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
all right so the status errors is is

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,800
known as a number error on our platform

221
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,040
so uh let's say you visited a platform

222
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
or a website and uh you got a 500 error

223
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,459
that usually happens uh

224
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,200
that doesn't usually happen but let's

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,300
say if you find a 500 or a four or four

226
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,060
or four via SEO backlink from Google

227
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,519
so when you land in uh on on such a page

228
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,980
uh you'll be shown a 404 or you'll be

229
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,620
seeing a 500 General letter maybe by the

230
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,000
you know

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,399
the load balancers nginx will give you a

232
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,459
500 error and that's it now if you want

233
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,160
to report such an issue right now if you

234
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,120
can go to

235
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,980
hacker one you can go to background you

236
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,779
can record such an issue

237
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,540
okay that's it uh they'll resolve it or

238
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,740
maybe they'll resolve it on their own

239
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,100
but yeah it gets unnoticed now these

240
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,860
error codes corresponds to a lot of uh

241
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,380
other issues as well you can find the

242
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,240
HTTP response codes for several such

243
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
issues now these These are sent out by

244
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,600
the the web servers based on the

245
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,500
situation

246
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,880
and uh that can be captured on BLT via

247
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,640
the reporting feature or via the

248
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,240
extension which we have

249
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,160
now for security let's say you come

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,540
across

251
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,339
you come across a SQL injection

252
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,760
somewhere or you can do an exercise

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,260
somewhere and you figure out that this

254
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,459
this xss works on this list now these if

255
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,519
it's a very major issue that can be

256
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,680
prioritized as a P0 P1 and that will

257
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,360
impacts uh impacts user but

258
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,240
uh yeah so that really impacts the user

259
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,500
but let's say that there are other

260
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,380
security issues as well uh which we have

261
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,899
noticed coming on the consoles uh

262
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,240
Sometimes some sensitive information is

263
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
broken out due to you know not proper

264
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,500
validation and security measures taken

265
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,680
on the API and you get to see other

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,940
users information

267
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,100
now that can be captured as part part of

268
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,660
the

269
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,480
security category within uh issue

270
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,800
reporting

271
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,260
and as soon as uh such a issue is

272
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,660
reported uh the the corresponding

273
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,399
company or the website is emailed right

274
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,120
away

275
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,120
uh and then you can track the progress

276
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,339
based on the email you'll be cc'd along

277
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,620
with that now uh for all these

278
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,459
categories we do have uh you know smart

279
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,380
uh smart way to figure out who is the

280
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,300
proper Authority we have crowdsourced ad

281
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
information as well to figure out which

282
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,680
is the proper email Channel

283
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,279
and and BLT also takes care of following

284
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,620
up on those to get to a resolution or at

285
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,140
least get a get some value proposition

286
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,220
out

287
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,019
either yes or no for the users

288
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,079
now let's talk about the functional uh

289
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,959
issues which happens so uh you know

290
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,120
functional issue is something as as I

291
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,459
discussed about let's say uh in

292
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,680
e-commerce platform where you went to

293
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,779
the e-commerce platform uh you want to

294
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,120
buy uh you want to buy a product

295
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,440
uh or let's say you want to uh wishlist

296
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,959
the product and you want to buy it later

297
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,399
but uh when you when you try to question

298
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,459
the product either the uh the web the

299
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,920
website responds with the success or it

300
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,019
doesn't respond at all and when you go

301
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,899
to uh device section the product doesn't

302
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,880
that does not exist and you get a bad

303
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,560
experience

304
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,920
it's a functional category covers uh

305
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,019
this component where you can report all

306
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,700
the issues related to the functionality

307
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,839
of our page as from the user's

308
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,779
perspective obviously uh and this yes

309
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,300
the typos a general typo unsanity issues

310
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,940
which come across different products uh

311
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,639
they it's it's a very small issue uh you

312
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,399
know but again it gets unnoticed and you

313
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,300
can use the platform to report typo

314
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
related issues and we email the

315
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,540
appropriate channel right away and that

316
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,519
that helps the users to get some

317
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,220
visibility

318
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,899
they might get so so all these

319
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,779
categories have uh points defined to

320
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,200
them so based on the type of issues the

321
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,540
user is reporting there is a point and

322
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,760
it starts off with one and it goes up to

323
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,399
three and four and as you accumulate the

324
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,579
point uh that that that points can be

325
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,660
converted back to uh Bounty cash and can

326
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,139
be redeemed

327
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,820
uh yeah now let's talk about performance

328
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,959
issues which uh users can report so uh

329
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,899
latencies are really a big problem for

330
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,120
very high throughput uh distributed

331
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,820
system so say if you did social network

332
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,980
and you try to picture in a full rest

333
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,100
and I did a very high load the web

334
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
server is not able to respond back

335
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,260
appropriately or uh so there is some

336
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,120
inefficient code or

337
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,980
there might be a lot of situations where

338
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,560
the latencies are quite high so if the

339
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
latencies goes up to one two seconds for

340
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,860
a generic flow and that's the case where

341
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,540
performance gets impacted for any

342
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,380
service

343
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,380
so the users can capture that

344
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,500
information and bring it back to BLT and

345
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,660
the platform takes care of

346
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,660
takes care of the rest and reports the

347
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,660
organization

348
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,560
yeah let's talk about design and user

349
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,579
experience

350
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,500
the aspect of reporting the bug now this

351
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,899
is a category where uh

352
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,300
uh I think that I I never seen a bug

353
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,079
Bounty or uh or any Bounty given for a

354
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,000
responsiveness or design side of things

355
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
but on our platform we have been

356
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,920
avoiding people uh and running a lot of

357
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,820
bounties around this as well so there's

358
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,639
a lot of researchers and a lot of

359
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,279
hunters you know just scratch around the

360
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,980
web and figure out uh you know someone's

361
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,100
responsiveness breaking uh the the let's

362
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,199
say there's a search box and that gets

363
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,260
that's breaking on an iPad works fine on

364
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,420
the web uh buttons not in the right

365
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,380
place

366
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,860
so all these design and user experience

367
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,339
uh issues and bugs can also be reported

368
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,720
directly from the source through the

369
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,240
extension with a screenshot and that

370
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,519
gets uh straight away to our platform

371
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,839
and users can you know upload and that

372
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,820
gets reported to the source or Source

373
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,300
organization

374
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,639
right

375
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,560
so apart from all these uh we have a

376
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,000
leaderboard in place

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,680
so leaderboard has been there for a

378
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,100
while now uh leaderboard uh refreshes

379
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,740
monthly so we have a monthly readabout

380
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,800
where you the top reporters

381
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,440
we will have the top reporters will have

382
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,459
a

383
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,680
leaderboard maintained and they'll be

384
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,040
ranked appropriately uh and then uh

385
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,680
organizations can come and sponsor a

386
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
researcher based on their performance

387
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,060
it's something similar to what GitHub

388
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,980
does for a project uh then sponsors and

389
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,860
sponsors the organization can sponsor

390
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,220
the users and these users can be given

391
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,259
additional points based on the

392
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,779
sponsorship and the price which has been

393
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,160
Associated and that can again be

394
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,199
redeemed in terms of cash

395
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,139
out of this leaderboard

396
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,139
in terms of activity we can see the

397
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,420
latest activity but yeah

398
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,520
all the activities can be visible on the

399
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,900
page and then you can scroll through it

400
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,359
search for it uh if you want to upload

401
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,939
if you want to report a issue just go

402
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,040
through the

403
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,459
activity before reporting a bug so that

404
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,679
there is no duplicates

405
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,819
and uh so if there are no doubly if

406
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,079
there are duplicates there's a chance

407
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,359
that the the latter one might get

408
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,940
rejected so it's better to go through

409
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,440
the activity and that's where this

410
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
activity segment helps us a lot search

411
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,000
okay search searches across this

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,280
activity so if a user wants to search

413
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,380
something they can go through the

414
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,299
activity and figure out

415
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,179
uh all the

416
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,400
all the issues which might be related to

417
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,580
this

418
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,620
all right

419
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,960
uh let's let's talk about subscription

420
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,179
so we have been uh we have this

421
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,919
subscription segment for a very long

422
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,280
time now uh we have we are live for a

423
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,260
very long time and subscription was

424
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,260
there a subscription helps us

425
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,220
uh you know to to get so on the so Vegas

426
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,280
is is a platform which runs on top of

427
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,780
these code base

428
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,120
and it it's a it's a commercial project

429
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,820
on top of PLT and subscription helps us

430
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,520
run all the backend and infra side of

431
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
things so right now based on so these

432
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,480
are the three subscription which we

433
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,080
support and these subscriptions uh don't

434
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,860
let create bug bounties uh on a priority

435
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,000
level they just uh let's create the they

436
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,660
just lets you the organization uh run a

437
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,940
bounty and those bounties would be

438
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,940
generic enough uh and and anything which

439
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,919
comes to the platform should be ranked

440
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,740
by the organizations and organizations

441
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,559
take a stab on whether or not to provide

442
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,820
bounties for those hunters and uh it's

443
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,679
pretty generic at the moment

444
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
but I'll I'll be talking about

445
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,360
subscription more I'll be talking more

446
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,600
about subscription uh in detail uh which

447
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,020
also covers uh private hunting uh not

448
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,440
disclosing the the issues and all the

449
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,380
vulnerabilities to public uh straight

450
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,539
away and organizations can choose to

451
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,179
close them on their side uh apply a fix

452
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,539
before releasing it to public but at the

453
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,160
moment all the issues are reported

454
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,539
publicly and there is no masking of

455
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,160
security vulnerabilities are hidden for

456
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,900
sure but others are they have there is

457
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,940
no masking as such so it's straight away

458
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,679
available to public

459
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,280
everything okay

460
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,880
let's talk about contests and uh or we

461
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,460
can call it bug hunts so customers can

462
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,720
start a bug bounty hunting program

463
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,120
through the platform and uh the

464
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,220
subscription feature allows an

465
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,580
organization or a partner to start a bug

466
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,380
a party or a hunting program

467
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,220
uh they need to provide the Bounty name

468
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,620
some some information about the Bounty

469
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,220
around with segmented covers and then

470
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,179
they can choose a price which can be

471
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,260
distributed across all the researchers

472
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,620
based on what they found

473
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,940
as as I mentioned we're working on a

474
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,140
detailed Barclay program management

475
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,120
system to run out all the kind of

476
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,340
bounties with severity levels and uh in

477
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,900
our multi-level dashboard

478
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,140
so the organizations would be able to

479
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,120
look at them prioritize them

480
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,140
uh directly create Awards uh split the

481
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,660
awards based on priority and everything

482
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,200
around that

483
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,460
so right now we have supported platforms

484
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,360
as web so we have a Django based uh

485
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,900
service with vanilla and vanilla JS and

486
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,980
pure HTML uh all the code bases are

487
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,740
available on GitHub we mostly work in a

488
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,840
distributed way we leverage Google

489
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,760
summer of code a lot for all these

490
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,100
development activities and I'll come to

491
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,320
uh that next when we'll talk about the

492
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,700
payment Integrations that did with

493
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,419
stripe for the payouts and and and how

494
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,640
we are going to introduce bug or proof

495
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,980
of stake coin uh for processing the

496
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,320
payouts for all these bounties but

497
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,820
before that let's talk about the probe

498
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,100
extension so the Chrome extension is an

499
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,679
extension which lets you record a bug

500
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
from any platform

501
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
so you can go to uh so you can install

502
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,460
the Chrome plugin from the Chrome Store

503
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,980
uh and then it can browse around any

504
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,659
website this is not available for mobile

505
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,320
devices uh for obvious reasons so a user

506
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,620
can browse around any website and uh

507
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,320
oh

508
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,159
yeah the user can browse around any

509
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,640
website and if the user finds any sort

510
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,179
of uh in terms of whatever categories we

511
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,820
discussed so far or maybe they find some

512
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,220
issue with the network calls giving away

513
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,659
additional information which is

514
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,480
sensitive and not not bound to be

515
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,580
returned logging

516
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,039
Etc all of these aspects can be captured

517
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,159
from the Chrome extension itself and and

518
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080
that Chrome extension also captures some

519
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,860
additional resources applies some uh

520
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,100
smart functionality in the back end

521
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,539
extracts out information as well to

522
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,640
create the property description and then

523
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,159
posts all of these informations to The

524
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,780
BLT platform

525
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,240
so this Chrome extension

526
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,960
apart from this there are other

527
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,240
roadmaps planned for uh improving the

528
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,740
Chrome extension in future which will

529
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,580
help us identifying uh trackers Etc on

530
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,220
top of all the other platforms which we

531
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,320
visit so that we are aware of the

532
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,299
security

533
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,980
and and all the nuances which happens

534
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,840
across

535
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,700
across the tracking and cross tracking

536
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,039
feature amongst the websites which we

537
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
see as of today

538
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,659
uh we also support mobile apps so we

539
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,940
started off with a fuse based product

540
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,260
two years ago it's a fuse uh based

541
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,120
application which we built in Google

542
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
summer of code uh

543
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,960
2020. this application helps us perform

544
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,120
similar activities and interacts with

545
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,679
the same back-end apis which we have

546
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,460
today

547
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,580
so it helps us track bugs issues

548
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,440
indirectly reported from anywhere on

549
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
your mobile you can do an any

550
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,700
interactive thing which you might do on

551
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,000
the website you can share record issues

552
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,780
you can upload you can create a new bug

553
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Bounty you can do payouts Etc directly

554
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,419
from the mobile apps itself

555
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,159
uh since last year we are we have moved

556
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,860
to flutter-based uh application because

557
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,440
fuse was not very much extensible for us

558
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,260
in terms of adding couple of features uh

559
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,440
using camera so we wanted to switch to

560
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
flutter so if you want to capture some

561
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,760
other additional uh

562
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,460
information and flutter worked quite

563
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,720
well for us

564
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,299
now I flutter app can be downloaded from

565
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,679
a Play Store

566
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,520
and can be used for reporting bugs and

567
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,580
other other kind of vulnerabilities

568
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,600
will be fine

569
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,000
okay let's let's talk about Integrations

570
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,900
uh which we did uh in terms of the

571
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,760
payment and how we leveraged stripe to

572
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,820
manage uh payments and and how from the

573
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,460
organizations and how we do payouts uh

574
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,179
to our users

575
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,419
okay so uh for payment integration uh

576
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,120
it's uh the flow is quite simple uh the

577
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,520
customers or organizations who are who

578
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,679
have partnered with us can come and

579
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,900
create bug Bounty programs on the web

580
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,620
portal and uh the customers can add a

581
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,679
price to the Bounty program they can

582
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,860
after adding the uh

583
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,659
amount they can do the transaction via

584
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,360
stripe and that gets to a stripe bullet

585
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,840
and uh doesn't get disbursed anywhere it

586
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,059
it stays on a hold on stripe until

587
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,299
unless we do our monthly payouts uh we

588
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,919
haven't integrated with striped as the

589
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,279
payment uh provider uh for uh all the

590
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,500
features which stripe had to provide in

591
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,779
terms of transaction uh and exchange

592
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,460
fees based on localities

593
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,320
uh we maintain a wallet so we create a

594
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,200
wallet as per our customer and we we

595
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,580
store the payment details for the

596
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,700
customer uh we accept the by customer

597
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,919
here I mean a user on The BLT platform

598
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,380
or a researcher on The BLT platform who

599
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,200
wants to come in and report an issue so

600
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,480
we maintain a similar very simple data

601
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,940
model or wallet and transaction we for

602
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,100
each user we manage stripe wallet uh

603
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,400
authorize the user to figure out the

604
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,620
authenticity of the customer and and

605
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,200
based on the Redemption uh based on the

606
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,700
Redemption pattern selected by the

607
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,760
customer we do the payout uh we actually

608
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
don't do the payout as of now this is uh

609
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,320
this uh this will be rolled out in a

610
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,320
month we are testing out all the uh all

611
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,799
the flows to figure out if it's uh it's

612
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,100
safe for us to develop and uh once once

613
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,380
a customer creates a wallet on the

614
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,940
platform approves

615
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,039
uh that they want the payments to be

616
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,320
scheduled on this day and how much

617
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,600
amount they want to withdraw there's a

618
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,460
simple uh background Quran which

619
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,080
triggers the payment and stripe

620
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,940
processes the payment to the customers

621
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,220
directly in their wallet

622
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,220
so we don't hold uh any payment on our

623
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,679
our end as such it's it's sort of an

624
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,200
escrow where organizations decides this

625
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,240
much this must be the amount the amount

626
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,520
gets transferred to the users in terms

627
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,000
of the uh points they have collected and

628
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,820
and that's where the payment processing

629
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,000
happens

630
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,240
so uh let's talk about how stripe

631
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,820
integration was uh

632
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,860
uh how we did this type integration it's

633
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,659
a very seamless integration which we did

634
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,380
uh during the dsoc session uh last year

635
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,419
uh This was done by one of our students

636
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,940
in gsoc and uh it's a very simple

637
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,279
integration which has uh two keys of

638
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,840
publishable keys and then you have a

639
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,179
normal tokens for security we keep all

640
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,100
of them in our Union piece and

641
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,600
uh use them on the Fly for processing uh

642
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,059
I can share the link to the blog post

643
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,100
around the detail Integrations if if

644
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,380
someone is interested on how we manage

645
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,539
stripe and we do East cross

646
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,520
uh as payment

647
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,140
uh

648
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,600
yeah that's that's mostly about this

649
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,459
type integration uh which we have

650
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,159
right let's let's move to the uh yeah

651
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,720
stripe usages

652
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,020
stripe usage is very uh very easy and

653
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,940
simple we just accept customer payment

654
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,400
and then send price to Bounty winners in

655
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,980
terms of cash and that that's all we do

656
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
with stripe we don't do any uh

657
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,960
additional items in terms of uh the the

658
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,260
proof of stake bug token which we are

659
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,900
introducing so stripe is just simply for

660
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,600
a for a normal currency which we have

661
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,480
today so we take USD we transfer to

662
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,039
other let's say if you want to transfer

663
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,500
uh the funds to an Indian account you

664
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,659
use INR to do that transaction

665
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,080
so yeah that's mostly uh around what we

666
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,960
have as of today uh in buglogging tool

667
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,679
uh most of the features are already live

668
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,559
in for payments payments will be out in

669
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,559
a month uh once we have a proper QA done

670
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,240
around that and that will be available

671
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,159
for uh people to use and and withdraw

672
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,960
all the coins they have all withdraw all

673
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,600
the uh price rise or coins they have

674
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,880
collected on the platform as of now and

675
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,059
then uh you stripe to take that take

676
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,000
that cash out uh for the all their hard

677
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,960
work

678
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,320
in terms of roadmap for uh for this uh

679
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,179
H2 2022

680
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,340
uh we have we are working on the white

681
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,919
paper for a bug a proof of stake point

682
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,899
for Bounty rewards it's still in a very

683
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,659
early phase where we want to

684
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,059
um create a new coin bug which can be

685
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,059
used on the platform as a stick

686
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,460
this will be uh mostly done on on top of

687
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,260
solidity

688
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,140
and the smart contracts would be

689
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,919
designed on top of POS so uh it's still

690
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,360
work in progress and we'll be sharing

691
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,299
out the white paper soon on the PLT

692
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,100
channel so please uh if you're

693
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,740
interested uh keep an eye on the channel

694
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,679
so that all the information and if you

695
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,840
have any comments around that uh will be

696
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,860
great to learn and I improve on that

697
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,679
so uh if it would mostly be on top of

698
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,080
ethereum smart chain or a binance smart

699
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,299
chain uh but we are open to suggestions

700
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:19,080
uh so please do uh chime in once we

701
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,159
release that

702
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,020
uh release the draft

703
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,940
uh we are also working on the ux

704
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,200
improvements as part of the CSG uh ux

705
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,179
improvements would be mostly in terms of

706
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,720
the front facing portal uh a lot of

707
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,760
design improvements and Designs which

708
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,039
have which which are already in place so

709
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,919
we just need execution and and that

710
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,380
would make the platform a bit smooth we

711
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,600
have seen a quite a hiccups in some in

712
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,500
last

713
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,880
uh of few months and users have been

714
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,220
reporting that so uh we wanted to

715
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,980
prioritize that this

716
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,480
as well

717
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,419
uh so uh ux improvements would be done

718
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,960
in roadmap for H22

719
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,240
uh so we are also working on private

720
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,919
issue reporting which is one of the

721
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,140
features or organizations want us to do

722
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,600
because nobody wants to

723
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,299
push out to sensitive information

724
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,960
directly to people so they want us to uh

725
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
provide a private issue reporting

726
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,279
feature on the organization dashboard

727
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,340
where they can uh you know manage and

728
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,500
and decide when and when not to release

729
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,899
the information directly on the uh

730
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,640
Forefront of the product

731
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,380
so we are working on the private issue

732
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,960
reporting part as well or some pieces of

733
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,179
work are already done some will be

734
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,000
covered in next couple of months

735
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,799
we need to roll out payments as well as

736
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,020
I mentioned Supply payments uh

737
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,120
integration is already in place

738
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,620
uh payments uh will uh will be a very so

739
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,600
we have been getting a lot of

740
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,200
uh queries from users around payments

741
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,360
and how when and when when will they be

742
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,100
able to redeem whatever they have

743
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,000
accumulated so far and I hope this helps

744
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,760
them uh the next is real-time assessment

745
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,600
of all the reports uh around a web app

746
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,720
so this uh this is the segment which I

747
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,880
was talking about uh on top of the

748
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,140
Chrome extension

749
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,659
so this this includes you know tracking

750
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,799
information uh and all all the aspects

751
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,360
of

752
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,940
around who is tracking if the current

753
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,240
website is tracking you or not uh if if

754
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,340
it's safe to be on this place what are

755
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,740
the cookies they are looking for all

756
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,659
kind of analytics and information would

757
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,460
be part of this Chrome extension update

758
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,620
which we'll be pushing so once you click

759
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,899
on the Chrome extension apart from uh

760
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,539
ability to submit a bug you'll be able

761
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,480
to assess

762
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,539
real time that uh that what what the

763
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,760
current website which you are on uh

764
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,799
captures with you what are the issues

765
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,380
reported on them so far uh were they

766
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,899
resolved or not and everything around

767
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,779
the uh around the product which you are

768
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,120
currently on

769
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,820
this gives a lot of visibility to our uh

770
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,220
users this is mostly around this is user

771
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,559
Centrics this is not around organization

772
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,460
so users would be able to have a real a

773
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,039
bird's eye view around uh is it's really

774
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,320
safe to be here uh what precautions they

775
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,779
can take and suggestions around that

776
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,279
so that's what we have for our roadmap

777
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,480
uh H2 2022

778
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,519

and all the references we are available

787
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,099
the code is open sourced on over PLT

788
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,859
this is for our backend and user

789
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,418
interfaces for web

790
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,820
for anything around

791
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,800
the mobile side of things the Chrome

792
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,960
extension which I talked about can be

793
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,379
figured out on Buckeyes GitHub for guys

794
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:25,379
so you can uh hop in there there are a

795
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,139
lot of open issues which uh which which

796
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,520
needs to be addressed if you're

797
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,080
interested you can hop in there you can

798
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,980
raise a PR and be happy to look at it

799
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,260
uh yeah that's that's all I had for

800
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,440
today

801
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,139
great thank you thank you very much so

802
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,460
there's a couple of questions from the

803
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,719
audience

804
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,359
um just like to to cover briefly so

805
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,639
first of all there's a question by Mohit

806
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,780
um and he's asking whether a BLT

807
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,000
includes only web or mobile application

808
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,680
or can it be actually used in reference

809
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,260
to any product he would be curious how

810
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,180
it would work with CV or any numbering

811
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,619
Authority yes by their respective

812
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,660
country

813
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,420
as of now we uh this is cross country so

814
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,320
we accept uh mostly Via Mobile and web

815
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,339
application

816
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,500
uh would be great to hear connect with

817
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,940
Mohit and understand its thought around

818
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,240
how we can leverage this for CV

819
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,540
so uh please feel free to reach out to

820
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,400
me we can discuss in detail around how

821
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,180
and what we can do to improvise and get

822
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,500
this feature

823
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,440
awesome and there's a question from my

824
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,560
and just says out of curiosity what

825
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,599
plans do you have for future releases of

826
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,359
the osplt

827
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,180
so yeah for the uh based on the roadmap

828
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,480
which I just shared uh the bug coin will

829
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,760
say take some time it's it's a long uh

830
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,760
shot apart from that payments uh would

831
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,280
be one of the major thing and uh

832
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,220
analytics around security of

833
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,520
any website as I mentioned uh around

834
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,400
that tracking feature all of these
