1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,140
my name is

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm PhD candidate in cryptography

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,700
in Osaka University here in Japan and I

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,680
would be

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,580
the moderator for decision so welcome to

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,019
exhibition track and the uh next

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,619
presenter is uh or not monanda who is a

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,640
senior solution consultant and he's also

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,340
passionate about security and he loves

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,340
to share his experience so I'm looking

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,079
and we are all looking forward to hear

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,000
from Mr Arnold and if you have any

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,879
question please post it by huwa and the

14
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,480
chat functionality is not working I

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,059
think for the participants so please use

16
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,100
that

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,159
platform to post your questions and we

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,320
have 10 minutes at the end of the

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,860
session for Q a and Mr Arnold would have

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,180
of 45 minutes to present his very nice

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,360
speech or not or to you thank you thank

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,040
you very much natural

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,259
um so thank you guys for joining us for

24
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,759
this session

25
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,979
um I wanted to have this session very

26
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,439
practical uh so in fact what we're going

27
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,200
to do today is to kind of discuss uh

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,420
some of the the basics of the different

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,000
topics and then what I will try to do is

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
to jump in and show you a demo of a

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,159
specific use case and how we can have a

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,860
solution for that specific use case

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,900
um so today the talk is going to be

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,320
about how you can use infrastructure as

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,479
a code to actually rate your friend

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,820
loaning process so we'll discuss some of

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,220
the challenges around those and let me

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,159
just show uh the calendar

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,820
um

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,220
so typically here today we're going to

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,399
do a quick intro into uh infrastructure

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,500
so as a code but it's not going to be by

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,380
knowing a full training on how on this

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,420
kind of platform we cannot discuss what

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,580
it is the good thing about it the

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,900
benefits

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,220
um then we'll discuss about threat

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,260
modeling and how we do automated threat

49
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,319
modeling and one of the topic that will

50
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,260
then be seen is you know how to actually

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,440
use both technology above methodology to

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,660
actually be able to accelerate your

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,879
thread loading process and then I'll

54
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,459
jump in and show you a live demo and

55
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,140
with that live demo you'll be able to

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,840
see some use cases some of the problem

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,180
that we have and how we address those

58
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,400
problem to accelerate the threat loading

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
process okay so with no further Ado I

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,280
will start with a very quick

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,640
introduction to uh infrastructure of the

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,040
code and all I can say that this is a a

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,200
great thing to have right so what does

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,580
it actually do so let's have a look at

65
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,340
the definition uh from Wikipedia well

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,379
infrastructure as a code is a process of

67
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,379
managing and providing computer data

68
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,840
center through our machine readable

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,000
definition files rather than the

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
physical configuration or interactive

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,959
configuration of tools so what does it

72
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,080
actually means uh well it's to put this

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,599
very simply you can take a configuration

74
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,180
file that we have here which is a

75
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,940
discreted file of an infrastructure and

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,340
this will help to deploy your whole

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,459
infrastructure so as an example uh at

78
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,879
your request whenever we want to deploy

79
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,280
a customer tenant in the cloud well we

80
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,920
use a cloud formation script which makes

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,440
it very easy for us to deploy this and

82
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,260
we can make it is very repeatable so we

83
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,420
can deploy any other customers by using

84
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,700
the same templates and so on so you can

85
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,099
see all of the goods nice world around

86
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,980
you know what is that infrastructure

87
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,319
code actually brings right so it is

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
scalable it's automated

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
um you know it's Pro efficient and very

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,860
uh

91
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,319
uh good for repeating different tasks

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,120
that you have internally so there are

93
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,879
many tools that we can use and depending

94
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,319
on the environment the cloud environment

95
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,239
that you use you can use the different

96
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,180
tools so some of the most famous ones

97
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,779
cloud formation on AWS and you know a

98
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,699
lot of people are also starting to move

99
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,100
into terraforms so these are the two

100
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,600
that we'll talk about today and how we

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,940
can use those ones to be able to deploy

102
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,560
infrastructures and make sure that those

103
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,860
infrastructure are secured okay

104
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,780
um the next topic that I'm going to talk

105
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,340
about and it is something that I'm kind

106
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,500
of talking on a daily basis because this

107
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,440
is what we kind of have as a product is

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
thread modeling and how we do thread

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,580
loading so we'll jump to the next line

110
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,759
and again we're gonna have a look at a

111
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,560
definition and probably I will explain a

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,900
little bit more about what we do here in

113
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,180
this kind of exercise so fret loading

114
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,639
again is another process in which we're

115
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,460
trying to find out potential threats

116
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,400
such as structural availabilities and

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,580
the SM essence of appropriate state

118
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,220
board and they cannabis identified it

119
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
can be intermediate it and the quantum

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,360
measure can be prioritized so typically

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,940
in this exercise we try to anticipate

122
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,139
some of the threats at design trades

123
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,759
um a lot of there is a lot of reasons to

124
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
actually do that at design phase and as

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,539
you can see here we have a chart that

126
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,060
shows well if you find something at the

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,460
design stage well obviously it is

128
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,580
cheaper to fix than wedding uh for this

129
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,800
thread to actually appear in your

130
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,199
release stage a lot of reason for that

131
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,940
typically you need to go through

132
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,460
different steps remediation boards

133
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,560
probably the application has already

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
been hacked so probably the certain some

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,860
cost Associated to being you've been

136
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,060
hacked and so on so the best practice is

137
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,400
actually to have a look at your design

138
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,500
and trying to find out of the design

139
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
flows there

140
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,220
um so what's automated threatenally

141
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,380
brings you is that it helps you to

142
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,320
automate uh the risk

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,539
um and the threats finding process so we

144
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,919
can automatically generate some risk

145
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,320
patterns it will reduce the time of

146
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,600
competition of a threat model so if you

147
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
haven't done a threat model manually it

148
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,320
might take you 30 days to actually do

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,080
that using the tool will reduce that

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,319
time to for example days or hours and

151
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,479
you can leverage different uh techniques

152
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,819
like templating and so on

153
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,620
it will increase the collaboration

154
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,780
between different things because here a

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,580
lot of teams can work together so

156
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,139
developers can start

157
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,120
building the threat model

158
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,819
or security Architects and then the CPT

159
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,740
team can come in and help them and see

160
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,360
what are the different security that

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,919
they need to complement

162
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,280
when you you use a an automated tool

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,639
because it is automated

164
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,819
the results are always consistent it

165
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,759
doesn't depend on the user's experience

166
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
so if I do a thread model I'm a junior

167
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,919
engineer does a threat model obviously

168
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,020
we'll have some differences but using an

169
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,120
automated tool actually will make sure

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
that we don't have we have a consistent

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,199
result all the time okay so a lot of

172
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,280
more

173
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,259
um

174
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,880
benefits to using automated threats

175
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,360
modeling tools and typically what we're

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
now trying to do is to figure out really

177
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,740
what is the link between those two

178
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,660
technology that we're talking about here

179
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,860
today

180
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,500
um so let me jump into the next slide so

181
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,800
typically the way we work uh with thread

182
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,380
loading and this is how we do the image

183
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,139
risk which is a tool for automated

184
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,419
automating your thread level typically

185
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,560
we'll start with some kind of

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,500
diagramming tool so we use in our

187
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
platform we use jordan.io from the

188
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,840
diagram in perspect active and we also

189
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,819
use some kind of questionnaire that can

190
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,440
help you to bring more details to that

191
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,639
threat model

192
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,039
then the next thing here is risk or the

193
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,039
automated tool will generate those

194
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,780
things that could go wrong

195
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,400
once they have generated those things

196
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,620
that could go wrong they also suggest

197
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,080
you know what are the remediation steps

198
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
what could you do to actually go and fix

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,979
those issues that you find within your

200
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,240
thread level

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,400
uh the next things once you have all of

202
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,440
that recommendation well we need to

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,419
actually do actually people can to

204
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,220
actually go and Implement what we

205
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,199
actually provided to them so the way we

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,060
can do things here now is to go and

207
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,539
track uh with issue trackers you know

208
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,880
the security issue that we send them to

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
jira to Azure devops and then see if

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
they actually implement this so we can

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,559
track uh with a two-way sync those kind

212
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,620
of inabilities okay so this is great and

213
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,360
this is helping us to find very early

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,959
some threats well if you now combine uh

215
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,560
the two approach using

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,519
um

217
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,940
the infrastructure as a code well one of

218
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,320
the benefits of that and I will show you

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,120
in a typical example whenever I just

220
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,700
jump into the product well you could

221
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,560
design some infrastructure as a code

222
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
template and deploy things but they're

223
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,420
not secure well if you do thread

224
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,399
modeling on those infrastructure as a

225
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,260
code well you're able to find those

226
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,019
threats even before the application or

227
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,959
the platform is deployed uh and so also

228
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,399
avoiding you know the cost of

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
remediation

230
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,660
um the infrastructure as a code helps

231
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,820
thread loading whenever you don't have a

232
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,500
diagram available and I'll show you an

233
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,260
example of that at the time today

234
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,940
um sometimes it could be too time

235
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,160
consuming to actually draw a complete

236
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,680
infrastructure industry uh probably uh

237
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,300
you know you don't actually know what's

238
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,820
behind your infrastructure so having uh

239
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,720
the

240
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,480
IAC template will actually help you

241
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
um the infrastructure sensor code also

242
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,980
helps you to automate the diagramming

243
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,700
without actually having a a human

244
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,740
interactions you know having and taking

245
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,959
out the human errors out of the the

246
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,980
equation

247
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,380
so if you look back at a diagram that

248
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,380
are the previous screen I was showing

249
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,839
you well this is how we build the first

250
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,300
step so show interior is risk or to the

251
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,700
platform what we're building so prior

252
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,880
before we used to use uh the diagramming

253
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
tool and with the diagramming tool we

254
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,720
were able to draw the diagram

255
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,240
this time what we're able to do is to

256
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,000
take terraforms or cloud formation to be

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,980
able to provide us some information

258
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,279
about the uh

259
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,779
the platform that you're going to be

260
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,680
building

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,860
then we can also use a

262
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,320
model that we call the openmodel open

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,680
flip model uh which will allows you to

264
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,760
describe

265
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,200
your infrastructure into the text

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,660
formats and in fact the two other ones

267
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,980
terraforms and cloud formation import

268
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,500
will actually use that as a intermediate

269
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,339
set

270
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,640
so this is how we will then be able to

271
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,980
take those diagrams make sure that we

272
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,839
have as many information that we as we

273
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,760
need for our thread model and we'll be

274
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,320
able to deploy that and we'll be able to

275
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,060
see the threats for those different

276
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,719
infrastructure

277
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,720
so in the next step what we'll see is

278
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,180
that now we have a very simple

279
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,779
three-step process in order to use uh

280
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,339
this uh

281
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,140
thread model and to use uh

282
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,540
infrastructure as a code so typically to

283
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,060
what you would do uh the first step will

284
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
well do like you normally do create your

285
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,200
uh

286
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,660
infrastructure as a code templates then

287
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,700
you can upload those templates

288
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,579
to our platforms then our platform will

289
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,620
generate the threats and we'll create

290
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,620
the tickets for the relevant team and

291
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,600
this could be fully automated right so

292
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,459
you could just create it automatically

293
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,320
then you can provide it using the API

294
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,140
and then erase risk will generate all

295
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,600
the threats that are relevant to the

296
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,940
different environments okay so this is

297
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,820
how very simple it is done by just using

298
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,380
automation using a couple other piano

299
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,779
calls and you'll be able to do them so

300
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,959
it is a very simple uh

301
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,240
process but in fact he has a lot of

302
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
power and what I will try to

303
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,220
demonstrate is how the whole thing

304
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,320
actually ties together and showing you

305
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,940
how you do the thread model within the

306
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,860
rest and then how you'll be able to

307
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,880
import those different uh diagrams into

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,920
image scripts and making sure that you

309
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,740
can leverage the different uh features

310
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,019
of the product to be able to track and

311
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,640
report on those different threads

312
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,600
so the next thing we're going to jump on

313
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,160
the table so like I said this is going

314
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,279
to be a very uh practical example and

315
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,660
then we can discuss we can have a lot of

316
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,640
questions about uh whenever I finish

317
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,540
this demo thank you

318
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,800
so I'm going to jump into air express

319
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,760
which is typically a web platform uh

320
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,680
hosted here in the club it can also be

321
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,220
hosted in your uh on-prem environments

322
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,019
and you can log in using different

323
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,959
living mechanisms okay so as you can see

324
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,060
here I've got different projects that

325
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm going to be able to work on I can

326
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,260
delete project I can do a lot of

327
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,519
management of those different projects

328
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,560
that I'm going to be building but I'm

329
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,540
going to build a very simple thread

330
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,279
model and I'm going to show you some of

331
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,079
the challenges that you'd have if you

332
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,120
were to have a very big uh

333
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,160
infrastructure behind your application

334
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,260
so let me go ahead and build a very

335
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,320
quick effect

336
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,300
so here probably I will provide a name

337
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,279
and so typically we use this example

338
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,120
here with the next few packets that has

339
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,920
uh that has where you are talking to it

340
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,660
we can customize those fields this is

341
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,579
not really too big of today but what I'm

342
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,620
going to do is to show you that we

343
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,380
integrate joe.io in order to do the

344
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,019
diagramming and then you can have

345
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,240
different components so not only we can

346
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,980
use your.io but you can also import from

347
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,660
different other sources if you have

348
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,279
other sources for to do your diagramming

349
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,899
and so typically here I'm going to

350
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,440
quickly drop uh my thread model and be

351
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,440
able to generate some of the threads

352
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,800
very quickly so I'm going to build a web

353
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,500
UI and whatever script will do it will

354
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,560
provide me with a component and this

355
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,899
component will contain all the risk

356
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,339
pattern that I need to be aware of

357
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,579
whenever I build a web UI so all the

358
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,440
security requirements that are needed

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,480
around a web UI

360
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,339
then what I'm going to be able to do is

361
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,279
to also bring more components this time

362
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,420
from the cloud

363
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,240
uh and so I'm going to do that by just

364
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,279
doing the search so I'm going to search

365
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,360
for NSP buckets

366
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,880
and then I'm going to search for example

367
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,760
for another an RDS database let's say

368
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,260
and let me also drop the Lambda function

369
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,160
just a little bit more

370
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,120
install it all the time

371
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,839
okay so I'm going to drop these

372
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,220
different components and like I said at

373
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,779
the beginning all these different

374
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,459
components will have

375
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,800
risk better in that same to them so I

376
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,420
can even show what are their

377
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,560
relationships and then I can even

378
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,779
provide protocol information if I wanted

379
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,639
to so I'm going to right click here and

380
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
edit the data flow

381
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,100
and for example this is secure network

382
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,519
so let's go ahead and provide it here

383
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,699
um so here very quickly I've built a

384
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,740
very basic thread model

385
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,300
um if I was doing this manually this

386
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,220
will take me probably a few hours but

387
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,660
here very quickly I was able to do that

388
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,639
and then if you want to find out what

389
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,839
are the threats what are the different

390
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,880
risks to this application if I did it

391
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,920
manually again it will take me a few

392
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,420
hours to actually figure out you know

393
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
what are the threats your web UI what

394
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,019
are the threats to an SV bucket and so

395
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,120
on so probably I would have an Excel

396
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,560
sheet somewhere where I need to copy and

397
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
paste into two different documents here

398
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,100
everything is done within the same

399
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,980
platform and you can have those results

400
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,000
very quickly uh provided here to you

401
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,480
so once it's updated in fact you can go

402
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,040
and check what are the different

403
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,260
security requirements for the different

404
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,940
applications or the different components

405
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,860
that you have within uh your page here

406
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,600
so you'll see for example on the web UI

407
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,279
there are things that are available to

408
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,260
you how to abuse the privilege how to

409
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,899
use clickjacking attacks and so on so a

410
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,360
lot of information a lot of security

411
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,980
requirement that you need to be aware

412
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,420
whenever you build a web application

413
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,220
same thing for other type of components

414
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,380
that we have here uh we have things

415
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,600
relevant for example for the S3 bucket

416
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,820
and we've seen sometimes in the news

417
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,220
where people have deployed S3 buckets

418
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,320
without securing them so here what we

419
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,300
providing uh to our users is actually uh

420
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,380
things that you need to consider

421
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,779
whenever you build or you have a less

422
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,339
Rebecca deployed out there in the world

423
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,139
so here for example data could be

424
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,000
actually limited all data could be

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
compromised so what do you need to do so

426
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,300
for example well you need to enable

427
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,940
backup how do you enable backup well CP

428
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,220
you can go in there and see what other

429
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,559
kind of recommendations so here you'll

430
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,839
operation team can leverage that as well

431
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,119
as your developer can also leverage uh

432
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,099
the security requirements for your web

433
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,500
application that you are building

434
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,859
okay so this is great when you have you

435
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,859
know a very simple diagram right so this

436
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,020
is this was very simple

437
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,199
well let's say from time to time we we

438
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,299
speak to customers and they said hey you

439
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,500
know what I've got this application that

440
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,240
I need to thread model but I do not have

441
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,919
a diagram and probably I don't have

442
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,240
anybody that can actually

443
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,179
knows how my application actually is in

444
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,260
the back end

445
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,660
um so what you can leverage here and if

446
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,100
I show you for example the way we build

447
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,500
our SAS environment it is a bit more

448
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,120
complex than the diagram we've just seen

449
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,419
so how do you actually leverage our ISC

450
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,280
to actually bring that part of my

451
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,780
application and then I can leverage that

452
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,059
and I can use that so this is simply by

453
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,059
using the cloud formation strips okay or

454
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,220
the terraform script that we're going to

455
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,440
be building so what I'm going to do now

456
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,780
is to just show you a very simple

457
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,440
example of a cloud formation script that

458
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,140
I'm going to build and I'm going to show

459
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,780
you how I can import it into Iris risk

460
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,860
so we have uh this kind of uh diagrams

461
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,500
in the created form okay so the role of

462
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,600
somebody or your devops team or your

463
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,400
developers that are trying to provide

464
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
some kind of a test application well

465
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,919
we'll create a cloud formation script so

466
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,900
here probably you will use some kind of

467
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,840
tool later or probably from the IDE and

468
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,919
what I'm going to do here I'm looking

469
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,380
from scratch I'm just gonna open one

470
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,419
that I already have somewhere and

471
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,940
typically what I can upload it here

472
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,120
I can use a local file

473
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,400
and I'm going to use the one that I

474
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,980
prepared it doesn't have much in it but

475
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,840
I just wanted to show you how you can

476
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,000
live with that so this application looks

477
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
a bit like the one I've just treated

478
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,960
manually which already has some kind of

479
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,539
Lambda functioning as database and so on

480
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,600
and the idea is to check that cloud

481
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
formation script that I was created here

482
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,980
as you can see below and then we can

483
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,520
import it into US risk and by porting

484
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,260
this to area switch you'll be able to

485
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,419
see that we're going to generate the

486
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,340
diagram but we're also going to generate

487
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,860
the threats and the content measures

488
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,120
that are relevant to each and every

489
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,620
component that we've seen with industry

490
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,780
so how do we do that

491
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,880
so again this is my script in the text

492
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,460
file uh what I'm going to now do is to

493
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,240
use the API to actually upload uh that

494
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,500
result to the platform so we have an API

495
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,480
which is documented on git on the

496
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,120
Swagger Hub and this is what it

497
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,100
providing well in order to provide

498
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,320
something to you is risk well you need

499
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,419
to use that API obviously you need to

500
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,280
some kind of authentication which I'm

501
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,700
not going to show using an API key and

502
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,039
then I need to provide some parameters

503
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,700
so uh if I select a file so I'm going to

504
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,400
select a file that I just created which

505
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
is called

506
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,760
ps3. yes

507
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,160
then what I'm going to be able to do

508
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,860
is to use that file to actually do that

509
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,020
so I did it before and I really had to

510
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,460
create Project Read it so we have to

511
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,200
give me an error but this time I'm going

512
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,140
to do it again and being able to send

513
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,900
that to you if it's risk if you were

514
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,679
successful well the API will return some

515
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,760
values

516
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,160
and those values are well I created a

517
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,620
project it is a standard project it is

518
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,600
open and these are the states that is

519
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,360
actually using if I now go back to my

520
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,039
ears instance

521
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,620
I will be able to see inside of all my

522
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,940
projects

523
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,280
a new project that has been created that

524
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,860
was called cloud formation inputs

525
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,679
so we can go in tune in and as you can

526
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,419
see all of the different components that

527
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,120
are built in into that section has been

528
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,280
added to areas risk I can already see

529
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,140
that it has some threats to those

530
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,240
different components and also the

531
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,520
associated countermeasures that are

532
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,460
relevant to them so what can I do with

533
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,740
this well obviously uh having created

534
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,799
that template before I actually deploy

535
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,500
it I can really quickly check what are

536
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,600
the different security requirements that

537
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
I need to implement

538
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
um if I don't implement it myself I can

539
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,660
actually send relevant ticket to the

540
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,100
relevant teams and this is what I'm

541
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,720
going to show you now

542
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
so I'm going to have a look at the

543
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,919
thread model that I created

544
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,960
go to the diagram that you'll see

545
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,100
and then we can see what are the

546
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,559
different components we can add more if

547
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,299
you want it for example say well this is

548
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,580
my infrastructure in the back end but

549
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,260
what is actually that I'm building so

550
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,360
again like I did earlier I'm going to

551
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
add the truth Zone

552
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,220
I'm gonna add the rest of my application

553
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,600
and then I'm going to say well I'm

554
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,918
building a web UI once again

555
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,320
and this time I can also have different

556
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,600
information communicating together so

557
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,240
here again I've provided this same kind

558
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,700
of information but now I know what all

559
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,020
the infrastructure behind it what are

560
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,100
the different components in my

561
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,840
infrastructure behind it so this way

562
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,299
I've built my friend logo much quicker

563
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,880
than I had to earlier and I know there

564
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,860
is more accurate and I've got all this

565
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,720
information about it

566
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,600
um so now if I I can also update the

567
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,340
model

568
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,080
and now what I'm going to do is to be

569
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,460
able to send those different information

570
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,679
that we have so the relevant teams can

571
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,720
actually go and fix those so as you can

572
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,299
see uh we have kind of accelerated uh

573
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,580
our thread model by providing much more

574
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,460
accurate information and that in uh you

575
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,740
know in a few seconds am I just using a

576
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,260
scripts and that's run in the background

577
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,200
and obviously if you modify a script or

578
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,179
if your infrastructure is changing you

579
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,799
can actually update that and you will be

580
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,960
able to update the thread model that you

581
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,880
have here before your eyes so I'm going

582
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,520
to go back to the different threads and

583
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,679
again I can go through those threads and

584
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,659
filter what they are and I can't even

585
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,840
send those different information to my

586
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,299
devsecop team so for example the work in

587
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,059
jira they work in Azure devops well I've

588
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,220
done I've created this replica well this

589
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,600
is what you need to go ahead and do and

590
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,539
fix it so I'm going to create a ticket

591
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,760
and because we have a two-way scene with

592
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,740
the ticketing systems not only we're

593
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,780
trading a ticket within our ticketing

594
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,520
systems we're also getting the ticket

595
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,820
number and we get an opening and with

596
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,179
that hyperlink you can then go back uh

597
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,539
to the ticket very quickly and you can

598
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,280
verify the same information that you

599
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,460
find within our platform and obviously

600
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,679
uh you can work with this detail and it

601
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,659
can do you can document so we provide

602
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,820
some external links uh for you to be

603
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,159
able to do to have some references and

604
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,539
learn more about what is the problem

605
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,940
here again and then obviously once

606
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,740
you've finished it you can put some

607
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,840
comments document what you've done and

608
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,620
then you can close that ticket

609
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,620
so closing the tickets will also close

610
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,020
uh the ticket we may never stressed so

611
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,780
you we can track from one way to the

612
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,240
other whether people actually doing into

613
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,100
our thread model and to actually fix

614
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,460
these things so and another use case for

615
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,100
that will be how you can have the

616
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,960
Auditors coming in looking at an

617
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,240
application and you can show them that

618
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,100
you've done the threat model you find

619
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,020
some threats you were able to provide

620
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,440
some uh fixing and you were able to do

621
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,240
that and track those fixed that you have

622
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,340
actually implemented within the product

623
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,320
so if I go back to the ears risk

624
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,960
platform what is also interesting is

625
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,059
that you can provide a roadmap of things

626
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,799
that you need to do so let's say that I

627
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
need to go and Implement my different

628
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
issues well I can expand my S3 docket

629
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,880
and see what other kind of contributions

630
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,159
that I need to apply to the list view

631
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,919
packets if I have a ticket I can

632
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,179
actually sync it and see what are the

633
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,220
tickets there and if there are any

634
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,659
ticket I can actually see them here and

635
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,580
I will see if they're being implemented

636
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,740
or not so as you can see here this

637
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,120
ticket was actually created and it was

638
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,280
implemented by closing it within uh it

639
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,640
was within my jira tool okay so I can

640
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,740
also prioritize so we say that we need

641
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,900
to have priority well here I can see the

642
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,580
priority and I can actually say well let

643
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,620
me first work on the highest priority

644
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,559
right so here straight away and it's I

645
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,700
see the kind of things I need to

646
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,740
implement to us in order to secure my

647
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,960
platform very quickly I can also see

648
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,220
this thing that I need to implement for

649
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,840
my application and that's something that

650
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,700
I will be also doing later but as you

651
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,820
can see all this security uh content

652
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,260
measures are available all the security

653
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,000
requirements are available

654
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,279
your security team can also feed some of

655
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,679
those security requirements so we're

656
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,020
flexible we can also asset from other

657
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,880
sources so your security team can bring

658
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,159
some security requirements for you to

659
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,140
actually be able to track against those

660
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,380
ones and because this is a web platform

661
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,779
uh very large groups can actually work

662
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,940
on this platform and can provide some

663
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,279
security features and provide more

664
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,260
security content if they will so

665
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,640
anything that you can see within the

666
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,159
platform is customizable so in fact if

667
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,320
you want it you could customize the

668
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,480
field you can customize the threats and

669
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,380
so on

670
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,260
so this is how you can easily take a

671
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,779
cloud information script or you can take

672
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,100
a

673
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,980
terraform script import it into various

674
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,500
risk and

675
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,940
speed up the process of doing

676
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,179
threatenable uh with this kind of

677
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,380
information

678
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,820
there's another way that you could do

679
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,679
that and this is something that uh there

680
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,480
was another talk today by Professor

681
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,460
Scott one of my colleague which was all

682
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,520
about otm and otm is just an open thread

683
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,760
model which we provided and people can

684
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,860
enrich it where you can actually

685
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,500
describe it to a textile text file how

686
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,720
your thing model actually looks like and

687
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,700
I can show you an example which is just

688
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,539
a text description of a of a platform

689
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,779
look it looks like a cloud formation

690
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,820
script and you can just import it within

691
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,559
a request and you'll be able to also

692
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,380
build uh connectors so let's say that we

693
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,940
you don't use cloudformation let's say

694
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,400
they use something else instead well you

695
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
can use the otm specification to build

696
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,880
your own uh

697
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,860
scripts and being able to translate that

698
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,779
to me into something that you wish to

699
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:22,799
understand

700
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,520
okay so once you have created and

701
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,140
generated all these threads we have send

702
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,539
those tickets to the relevant team

703
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:32,100
obviously what will be interesting is to

704
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,480
sit well you know what are the

705
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,740
implemented steps that we have actually

706
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,159
done what are the different uh thread

707
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,020
that are out there in our thread model

708
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,480
so here for example you could go to your

709
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,100
portfolio and actually try to understand

710
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,840
what are the risks of your different

711
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,360
applications uh

712
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,340
where are the mitigation efforts are you

713
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,559
actually doing what are the risk uh what

714
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,240
are the relatives risk and what is the

715
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,100
predicted risk are you actually facing

716
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,600
things so this way you can actually see

717
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,220
the thing that actually being done

718
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,080
within the Enterprise

719
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,260
um and for more advanced uh customer we

720
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,720
do also have analytics module where we

721
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,039
can actually create a lot of dashboard

722
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,380
and you can query the database to find a

723
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,179
lot of relevant information in terms of

724
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,840
what we have within the product okay

725
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,200
so as we've seen

726
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,960
very easily I was able to generate a

727
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,720
cloud formation strips

728
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,440
from the AWS resource manager and

729
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,779
designer I use that cloud formation

730
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,539
script to import it into areas risk to

731
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,960
fast forward the thread loading uh

732
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
process because I didn't know what my

733
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,400
platform looks like or I didn't know a a

734
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,000
good diagram of my platform but using

735
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,740
the cloud formation scripts I was able

736
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,320
to get that very quickly and was able to

737
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,360
generate a threat model and generate

738
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,940
some threats having those threats I was

739
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,400
able to see the recommendation and the

740
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,840
remediation step that I need to actually

741
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,120
Implement and then sending it to the

742
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,860
relevant team and those different teams

743
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,779
will actually work together to close

744
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,340
those different ticket that we've seen

745
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,740
within the tool so this is in a nutshell

746
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,620
you know how we can take

747
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,200
this kind of approach to fast forward or

748
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,419
to accelerate the threat finding process

749
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,179
and people that are just using doing uh

750
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,340
provide provisioning of platforms would

751
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,799
actually gain by knowing in advance well

752
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,120
what are the threats before actually

753
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,059
deployed and in fact in the uh

754
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,620
freightlining world we will actually

755
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,899
also benefit from using those templates

756
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,360
to speed up the process of doing this

757
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,580
kind of third model so this is typically

758
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,580
what I wanted to show you today

759
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,320
um a very

760
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,820
specific example very Hands-On and so

761
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,399
probably I will take some questions and

762
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,720
see if there's any more topics that you

763
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,700
guys would like to discuss and see how

764
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,279
we can everyone see it uh so that's why

765
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,480
I'm pretty sure that we can open the

766
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,919
decoder and see if there's any questions

767
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,220
uh thank you for a very good uh

768
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,679
presentation we got couple of questions

769
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,000
so let me read it actually okay I just

770
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,140
asked us

771
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,899
I know how good threat modeling

772
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,960
management saves me time and anticipate

773
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,500
issue from design but what do you

774
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,620
recommend for tracking them use Excel

775
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,220
files for a manual approach hybrid using

776
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,919
tools such as conference or specialized

777
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,679
software tools to automate that process

778
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,000
thanks

779
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,080
so um on the on most daily basis you

780
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
know I talked to sports prospects I

781
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,640
talked to customers which who have

782
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,919
actually started doing threatening using

783
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,159
Excel sheets uh and typically what they

784
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,020
will tell us is that well they cannot

785
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,539
scale it right you know we want to do

786
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,000
more fat model we want to do more uh

787
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,120
with less resources right uh well Excel

788
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,919
sheets will not cut it it will not help

789
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,980
you at all so users using automated tool

790
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,200
I like the one I'm showing you here will

791
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,600
help you to speed up the process not

792
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,399
only that but also make sure that you're

793
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,620
better organized in terms of hey how do

794
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,600
I share this different information well

795
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,919
I don't need to send a PDF file

796
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,260
everybody can log into the platform with

797
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,659
different uh permissions and so for

798
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,059
example a specific role might just be

799
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,860
interested in seeing dashboards but not

800
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,720
the specific threats of what people are

801
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,159
doing on those threads and some people

802
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,600
might be more interested in that so

803
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,820
using this kind of platform are Fame for

804
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,399
me anyway it's a better uh way to do it

805
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,279
helps you to scale so if you look in the

806
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,380
Enterprise most of the time you would

807
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,419
have one or two security guys or maybe

808
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,520
more but you have hundreds of developers

809
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,679
so if you use this kind of tool you can

810
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,860
actually try and shift left you know

811
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,659
having the developer or the security

812
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,120
architect starting to do this work and

813
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,500
as you've seen during the diagram it's

814
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,059
very easy so they can even leverage a

815
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,960
diagram from somebody else

816
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,120
thank you

817
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,039
so uh

818
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,299
just

819
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,480
I hope you have got the answer but still

820
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,220
if you have if you need clarification

821
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,440
please post your question I will read it

822
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,559
so the second question is it says does

823
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,039
Iris risk also scan the IEC or Ike files

824
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,919
for possible misconfiguration or does it

825
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,200
only scan for resources and bring up

826
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,620
aesthetic list of security work mobile

827
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,880
vulnerabilities and corresponding

828
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,120
controls okay so right now where we

829
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,700
started we actually only looking at the

830
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,140
threats for those different components

831
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,360
but this is where we want to go we want

832
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,440
to make sure that we also look at

833
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,360
configuration and we can provide some

834
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,559
information around those different

835
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,899
configuration well ahead of time

836
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,659
and in fact you can build those rules uh

837
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:49,860
so I didn't talk about the wood engine

838
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,100
but if customers already had uh some of

839
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,720
those specifications they can actually

840
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,520
build rules to actually say Hey you know

841
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,580
you're building a uh a cloud application

842
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,559
and you have a web server talking

843
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,200
directly externally well this this is

844
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,220
not really good well I can actually

845
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,960
create a rule that will flag that this

846
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,760
is not a proper configuration within my

847
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,080
uh within my friend model

848
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,159
thank you very much

849
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,260
uh the third third question is like do

850
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,980
you think the application developers are

851
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,220
responsible for the security

852
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,260
okay so that's a that's a very good

853
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,340
question uh I think we had a we had a a

854
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,440
talk a while ago where we kind of asked

855
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,299
this question where we have developers

856
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,059
against you know security teams and who

857
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,519
should do one right uh and it's a very

858
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,980
interesting uh topic and I've been based

859
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,260
off quite a while so I used to sell uh

860
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,539
static code analyzer right so looking at

861
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,880
security philosophical and trying to

862
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,399
figure out who's responsible again it is

863
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,080
a shared responsibility because

864
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,519
everybody is involved within the

865
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,740
security life cycle of an application uh

866
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,179
developers will be the one that

867
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,519
introduce security issues so obviously

868
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,380
whenever there's a security issue

869
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,059
they're the one that will have to fix it

870
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,460
so if you did it well from the beginning

871
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,879
then you have to fix things but also you

872
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,040
know security Team all responsible

873
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,719
because they are the one whenever

874
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,859
there's a security shoot the other one

875
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,440
that'll be you know uh back and forth to

876
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,780
actually try and fix it uh but in help

877
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,040
with the developers so if you're trying

878
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,260
to break the gap between the developers

879
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,179
and the different teams if you bake

880
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,580
security team security into your life

881
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,339
cycle this is what you know people

882
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,899
actually recommend this is the best way

883
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,580
to improve the portion of your

884
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,320
application in terms of the security of

885
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,820
those applications

886
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,500
I think so I think it's a shared

887
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,599
responsibility it's not like a security

888
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,460
engineer or security advisor

889
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,440
responsibility there was always a gap

890
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,599
right so I started the application

891
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,080
testing about 13 years ago and I used to

892
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,280
go around and you know find

893
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,619
vulnerabilities in applications and

894
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,540
people will tell me well this is you

895
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,000
know application the uh the developers

896
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
are responsible the developers will tell

897
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,640
us well no the uh the security team is

898
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,900
responsible because they just need to

899
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,060
put a firewall and in fact when you look

900
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,680
at it no it is an application

901
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,079
availability so you need to do some kind

902
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,359
of coding behind it so the developers

903
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,820
will have to do that security will not

904
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,740
know how to code the application so

905
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,180
again depending on where the

906
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,280
availability shows up it might be for

907
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,920
safety or it might be for uh for the

908
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,480
development so now we have new

909
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,680
technologies where people are saying

910
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,720
well now I can put a web application

911
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,480
firewall and again this is another very

912
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,880
interesting uh topic where you know we

913
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,760
can argue hey if I put a firewall in

914
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,920
front of application well I can fix this

915
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,619
application completely for security post

916
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,720
um well yes this is good but what if

917
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,060
your firewall doesn't work very well but

918
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,099
what if at some point there's an issue

919
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,720
with your firewall then your application

920
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,940
becomes again vulnerable so you can buy

921
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,099
you sometimes but again you have to go

922
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,359
back and code your application and make

923
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,700
sure that you secure it

924
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,980
um thank you very much uh so the next

925
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,040
question is like do you think is a good

926
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,119
idea to Outsource the threat modeling of

927
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,880
the application or do you think it's

928
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,480
better to do it inside the company or or

929
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,460
any industry

930
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,339
well to be fair I don't have any um any

931
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,480
preferences

932
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,640
again it really depends

933
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,220
on do you have the capacity to actually

934
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,900
do it internally

935
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,119
uh if you don't well probably you cannot

936
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,220
Source it but then who do you associate

937
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,940
to

938
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,320
but you associate to the people that

939
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,000
actually building your code

940
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,740
probably not a good idea

941
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,380
uh but if they're doing the thing in the

942
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,880
correct way probably they can show you

943
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,740
proof that they've done things correctly

944
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,520
so we've seen more and more uh

945
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,380
but Sr is actually

946
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,359
being able to show with that fret

947
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,619
loading on application before we

948
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,180
actually build it and we can show you

949
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,380
what we've done around the thread that

950
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,000
we find early so

951
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,619
um external guests can actually show you

952
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,660
that they do a good job right so again

953
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,540
it could be either

954
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,099
but I would prefer to do internally for

955
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,599
my own application if I've got the

956
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,579
resources to do it

957
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,079
okay

958
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,380
thank you maybe the probably the last

959
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,060
question

960
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,339
uh the question is should we use cloud

961
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,800
infrastructure in Canada for risk or

962
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,619
maybe a high trade modeling

963
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,020
so can you repeat that question sorry so

964
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,480
the question is should we use the cloud

965
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,079
infrastructure scanner for risk for the

966
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,579
IEC or we call the high thread modeling

967
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,560
well

968
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm not quite sure

969
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,700
which one you should you should use

970
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,160
right so you know security is has always

971
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,140
been like a kind of an onion ring right

972
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,079
so you can always add more layers uh to

973
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,480
whatever you do right so you know it's

974
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,339
like people will tell me hey if I do

975
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,200
thread model should I still do pet

976
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,900
testing uh should I still do source code

977
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,540
analysis and so the answer is normally

978
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,160
yes and again it depends on your

979
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,740
resources uh and so you know whatever

980
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,640
works for you or for your organization I

981
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,560
believe this is uh the best way to

982
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,180
actually do that because some

983
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,859
organizations will try to be threatening

984
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,359
and it will take them long time to

985
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,339
actually do it some organizations will

986
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,680
just choose to do pen testing and they

987
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,780
will live with that and uh but you know

988
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,099
we've seen more and more people starting

989
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,260
with threatening so shifting left really

990
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,660
the responsibility uh making sure that

991
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,820
uh applications are designed with

992
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,800
security in mind and even if you look at

993
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,740
the oops top 10 uh that was just

994
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,540
released or last year or I can remember

995
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,520
when it was released well there's a new

session been introduced which was

997
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,420
insecure design right so even in the top

998
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,820
10 we kind of you know not just speaking

999

about cross-ass scripting or input

1000
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,540
validation we're also thinking about hey

1001
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,700
you should look how you design your

1002
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,200
application and make sure that you bake

1003
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,660
security inside of that secure design as

1004
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,760

00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,660

1050
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,140
numbers

1051
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,859
see

1052
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,660
this

1053
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,160
five

1054
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,140
so this one three three

1055
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,119
and a zero

1056
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,379
you see

1057
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,220
but it's an o and a three right yes the

1058
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,880
zero comes first

1059
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,240
which means it's three if it was a three

1060
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,520
then a zero it would be 30.

Dojo Channel where you can ask all sorts

1098
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,859
of questions ask for help ask for

1099
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:12,540
recommendations or even provide

1100
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,579
suggestions and input to those that are

1101
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,740
asking the questions it's a very fluid

1102
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,940
Channel where everyone just kind of

1103
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,880
helps with one another but if you are

1104
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,740
actually developing if you develop the

1105
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,720
channels that's specific for just those

1106
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,680
purposes

1107
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,180
such that the moderators

1108
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,520
get across the line a little quicker so

1109
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,740
that's probably the best place

1110
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,740
go with python help
