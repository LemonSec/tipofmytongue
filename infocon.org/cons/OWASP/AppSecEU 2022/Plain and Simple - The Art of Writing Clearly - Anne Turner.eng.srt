see my title slide yeah I see it's like

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,440
that

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,079
fantastic okay brilliant thanks everyone

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,960
for joining my talk today uh plain and

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,100
simple the art of writing clearly

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,820
all of us have come across uh writing

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,700
that's almost impossible to interpret

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,680
whether that's legalese running for

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,020
pages and service contracts business

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,360
speak of Blue Sky Thinking and mission

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,640
statements or commercially in every

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,619
sales pitch that we've ever been

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:20,759
presented

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,159
what we don't always recognize though is

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,799
that we too communicate in our own

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,240
mysterious language

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,759
as Security Professionals and developers

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,100
our jargon dictionary is full to

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,180
bursting

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,159
our technobabble is quite frankly

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,159
mind-boggling

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,220
with the information that we communicate

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,500
is in writing

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,159
and emails reports design documents

41
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,259
manuals and wikis

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,640
and the quality of that communication

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,939
can be the link between what we do and

44
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,280
the recognition that what we do has

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,640
value it can also make the difference

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,820
between uh whether we get budget and

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,459
resource for things that we need whether

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,258
people take the actions that we need

49
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,700
them to take

50
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,400
so in this talk I'm going to break down

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
the principles of plain language to help

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,340
you communicate clearly plainly to

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,379
whoever it is you're writing for whether

54
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
that's board members technical peers or

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,140
new starters I'll explain how plain

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,180
language benefits everyone no matter

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,660
their experience knowledge or level of

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,360
literacy and I'll also give you some

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,060
practical tips that you can use to help

60
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,099
make your writing more effective

61
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,400
whatever you're trying to say

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
yeah

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,040
uh just try to get this to move on

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,980
before um I get into the main part of my

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,840
presentation I thought I'd just uh give

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,220
you a quick introduction to myself

67
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,819
um my name's Anne and when I'm not at

68
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,780
work or annoying my cats I can be found

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,980
around the virtual roads of watopia

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,819
or any of the other worlds in zwift

71
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,159
um I write an obscene amount of

72
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,920
kilometers in that game

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,739
um but hey Fitness without leaving home

74
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,980
um professionally I've spent 14 years

75
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,159
working in various information security

76
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,239
consultant roles both within internal

77
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,640
security teams Consulting with other

78
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,940
areas of business and also as an

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,180
external security consultant assessor

80
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,340
auditor

81
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,739
um I've been

82
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,959
um really I've been a security standard

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,000
and risk management specialist through

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,019
most of my security career

85
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,000
um I actually came into security uh

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
through training and Communications

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,099
um my background my educational

88
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,599
background is in language and

89
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,180
Linguistics so not the study of multiple

90
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,239
languages but um the way that languages

91
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,519
work um effectively the science of

92
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,120
language and in all of the roles that

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,660
I've had with insecurity I've functioned

94
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,120
really as a bit of a translator between

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,520
my technical colleagues within security

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,759
teams engineering departments and

97
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
um and then with the non-technical teams

98
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,540
in other parts of the business from

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,940
Senior Management to

100
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,759
um end users call center agents and so

101
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,680
on

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,740
more recently I actually have left my

103
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,040
consultant role and have set up my own

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,880
business

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,280
um Affinity editorial working as a cyber

106
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,639
security specialist writer editor and

107
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,500
proofreader

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,479
um so

109
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,060
without further Ado I will get into the

110
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,600
main part of my talk today uh just one

111
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,360
final thing before I do I I want to just

112
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,699
add a quick caveat that

113
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,020
my talk is about plain language today

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,880
um not plain English

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,259
but

116
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,139
because the conference is is in English

117
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,740
um I'm an English speaker and my other

118
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,259
linguistic knowledge is language

119
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,979
knowledge is um disneyly small I'm

120
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,479
working on it

121
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,840
um my examples will be in English but

122
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,880
all of the concepts and principles that

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
I talk about today

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,520
apply across most languages

125
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,380
um so I hope that there is something

126
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,100
that's useful in this talk for everyone

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,620
okay

128
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,300
so

129
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,360
the technology sector has a huge

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,060
vocabulary of terms and the security

131
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,259
sector

132
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,120
even more so

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,139
so we have specialist terms uh things

134
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,220
like ransomware or fishing

135
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,979
um malware these mean very

136
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,199
um specific things they may well have

137
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,580
started out as as jargon terms that have

138
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,639
now been adopted more widely as as part

139
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,680
of our specialist language if you like

140
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,199
for the community

141
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,759
and one word that I think is a really

142
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,259
interesting one under the specialist

143
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,060
terms isn't it is is

144
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,580
an exploit so

145
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,380
one of the things that's interesting

146
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,120
about a lot of our specialist

147
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,419
terminology within security is a lot of

148
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,300
the languages borrowed from other

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,960
um

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,860
parts of life really so exploit as a

151
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,139
verb to exploit something is to take

152
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,360
advantage of something that's fine most

153
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,460
people understand the word exploit in

154
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,880
that context but we actually use exploit

155
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
as a noun

156
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,000
um describing

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,039
um a thing that does the exploiting

158
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,160
right so an exploit takes advantage of a

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,199
vulnerability or a weakness in in an

160
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,520
organization I think that that's a

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,479
really

162
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,880
um interesting example of the way that

163
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,139
we have

164
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,139
got our own sort of

165
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,419
um however familiar some of these

166
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,639
phrases are within everyday life we

167
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,099
actually have a really specialist

168
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,800
um definition for them especially in

169
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
certain contexts

170
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
other types of language that we have are

171
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,639
our jargon terms so these are perhaps

172
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,380
more things like

173
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,660
um smashing and fishing

174
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,780
that we use as short forms to explain

175
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,479
different types of fishing with it

176
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,220
between ourselves

177
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,780
um

178
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,020
and then we have phrases uh more like

179
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,340
you know Elite and fud and those sorts

180
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,160
of phrases that fall more into the

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,620
category of slang

182
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,280
um

183
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
the thing is we're not always very good

184
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,819
at translating any of these things for

185
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:13,259
non-specialists and we're not always

186
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,560
that good at explaining exactly what

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,000
interpretation of a word specialist

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,639
jargon or slang between ourselves as

189
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,500
well and and some of these things can

190
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,020
have um just subtly different meanings

191
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,300
depending on who you're talking to so

192
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,279
we'll come on to that further on in the

193
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,559
presentation

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,200
the big challenge with that is that it

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,380
often makes security

196
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,719
um feel very overwhelming and

197
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,459
inaccessible

198
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,120
even to people who are otherwise

199
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,860
incredibly literate

200
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,600
um and and find

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
um

202
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,740
language reading most materials quite

203
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,339
accessible

204
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,519
so what do we actually mean by plain

205
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,260
language

206
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,440
so the concept of of plain language

207
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,680
isn't anything new in fact

208
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,740
um there is a quote that is attributed

209
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,560
to Hippocrates that says the chief

210
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
virtue that language can have is

211
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,060
clearness and nothing detracts from it

212
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,480
so much as the use of unfamiliar words

213
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,180
foreign

214
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,680
to the international plain language

215
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,980
Federation the definition of plain

216
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,839
language is

217
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,360
that a communication is in plain

218
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,600
language if it's wording structure and

219
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,360
design are so clear

220
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,060
that the intended readers can easily

221
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,140
find what they need

222
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,420
understand what they find

223
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,899
and then use that information

224
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,820
okay plain language is not about dumbing

225
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,980
down the information that we need to

226
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,120
share

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
but it is about presenting it in a way

228
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,700
that's easy for whoever we're talking to

229
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,240
to understand and that can look very

230
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,980
different

231
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,519
for different groups of people

232
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,279
so as I said later on I will share more

233
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,700
practical tips about writing using plain

234
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,220
language but before I do that I do want

235
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,040
to explain a little bit more about why

236
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,320
it matters and actually some of the

237
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,959
value behind using

238
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,680
um plain language

239
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,899
so on this slide you can see a chart

240
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,720
that shows the levels of literacy for

241
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,760
adults across the oecd countries

242
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,459
um that's the organization for economic

243
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,440
cooperation and development and it

244
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
includes most of Continental Europe as

245
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,760
well as Australia Canada the US and some

246
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,040
parts of South America

247
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,060
now the data here is from the survey of

248
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,339
adult skills that was published in 2019.

249
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,560
and each of the colored

250
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,540
bars shows the percentage of that um

251
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,519
nation's countries uh population at a

252
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,480
given literacy level

253
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,279
now

254
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,920
there are four sets of shading on these

255
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,100
slide reading left to right on the left

256
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,779
hand side of the slide you have people

257
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,079
with the lowest levels of literacy and

258
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,380
on the right hand side you have the

259
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,620
greatest levels of literacy

260
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,500
and down the middle roughly speaking we

261
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,720
have

262
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,160
a vertical bar and that vertical line

263
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,279
that sits in in between the The yellow

264
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,700
greeny section and the darker blue

265
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,140
section

266
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,440
um approximately the middle of the chart

267
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,360
um or the the second set of shading from

268
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,480
the left and the second in from the

269
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
right

270
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,300
um there's a vertical line that line

271
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,480
represents the minimum level of literacy

272
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,079
that is required to be considered

273
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,420
functionally literate

274
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,420
and that is the level of literacy that's

275
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,440
required for coping with everyday life

276
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,899
so just to help to explain that a little

277
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,880
bit more

278
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,579
the color section to the far left

279
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,320
of the chart

280
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,579
in Orange is made up of adults who are

281
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,700
considered to be below level one

282
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,700
or below as far as their level of

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,820
literacy what that means is that these

284
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,060
adults cannot read a text or understand

285
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,940
the structure of sentences or paragraphs

286
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,459
okay at level one they might be able to

287
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,040
identify a single piece of information

288
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,779
in a text

289
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,339
if it's identical to information that is

290
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,620
given in a question so if the text said

291
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,139
Bob's ball is red and the question said

292
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,079
what color is Bob's ball

293
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,940
they might be able to answer that

294
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,320
question

295
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,700
okay

296
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,260
it isn't until level three so the

297
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,240
intersection that's marked by that

298
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,160
vertical line

299
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,260
the group just to the right hand side of

300
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,260
that the adults start to be able to read

301
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,839
and navigate longer texts longer pieces

302
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,220
of information

303
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,220
and that is considered to be the minimum

304
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,139
level of literacy that's required for

305
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,440
coping with everyday life and and in a

306
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,720
lot of cases increasingly in Modern Life

307
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,480
for everyone that sits to the left hand

308
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,120
the left of that vertical line

309
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
things like navigating a bus time table

310
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,120
reading a menu or recipe or reading

311
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,680
instructions

312
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,880
are off the table

313
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,300
in the UK that line represents about 49

314
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,040
and a half percent of the adult

315
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,880
population and that is actually similar

316
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,240
across much of of Europe

317
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,420
now we tend to assume that everyone

318
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,760
we're working with shares a similar

319
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,779
level of literacy can read as well as we

320
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,220
can

321
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,620
but that couldn't be further from the

322
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,440
truth and actually the more clearly and

323
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,720
simply we can communicate important

324
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,019
information the more accessible

325
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,980
it becomes

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,660
on the other hand we have people who

327
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,699
have incredibly high levels of literacy

328
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,100
so on that chart the people at the very

329
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,040
far right hand side

330
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,800
on this slide I'm showing a quote that's

331
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
taken from a government

332
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,380
um writing guide in the UK specifically

333
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,480
talking about writing well for

334
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,000
Specialists so these are people that we

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,860
can assume have higher levels of

336
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,699
literacy and generally understand

337
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:35,579
specialist terminology jargon acronyms

338
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,519
specific to their field

339
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,980
so research shows that higher literacy

340
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,199
people prefer plain English or plain

341
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,540
language because it allows them to

342
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,880
understand information as quickly as

343
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,220
possible

344
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,320
in 2018

345
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,860
there was a study published uh looking

346
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,740
at the uh preferences of a legal

347
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,240
audience

348
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,220
um a group of legal Specialists into

349
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,019
their preference for plain language

350
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,180
and that research found that of those

351
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,300
surveyed 80 percent of people preferred

352
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,800
sentences written in plain English

353
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,920
the more complex the issue the greater

354
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,440
that preference became

355
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
um and for example

356
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,560
97 of readers preferred to see the

357
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,720
phrase among other things

358
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,959
over the Latin into Alia

359
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,259
now bear in mind that this is a group of

360
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,920
specialists uh legal professionals who

361
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,440
are very very familiar with these common

362
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,899
Latin phrases because they litter our um

363
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,820
legal language in the UK

364
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,699
the survey also found that the more

365
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,160
educated the person was and the more

366
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,380
specialist their knowledge

367
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,020
the greater their preference became for

368
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,220
plainly plain English

369
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,839
people tend to understand complex

370
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,079
specialist language higher level

371
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,179
um readers understand complex specialist

372
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,799
language but they don't actually want to

373
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,439
read it if there's an alternative

374
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,859
and the reason for that is that the

375
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,839
higher the level of literacy we have

376
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,200
often translates into the amount of

377
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,740
content and information that we have to

378
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,799
process in any given day just think how

379
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,140
many emails you receive every day that

380
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,840
we communicate through slack and

381
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,480
messaging tools and all of this requires

382
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,419
reading or and without

383
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,760
um accessibility tools it requires

384
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,600
reading we're bombarded with words

385
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,820
all day every day

386
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,200
so people who are highly literate this

387
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
can often mean that we're short on time

388
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,160
and our reading demands the reading

389
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,679
demands that they have are incredibly

390
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,820
High

391
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,039
and so it helps when we can access

392
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,740
information really quickly

393
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,200
and plain language and reading simpler

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,660
documents helps to make that easier to

395
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,640
do

396
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,780
plain language also has a lot of benefit

397
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,200
to play when we're working with people

398
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,539
who are reading in a language other than

399
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,220
their first

400
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,200
as we often work with International

401
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,679
colleagues and this is an International

402
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,419
Conference this is something that we

403
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,760
need to think about every time we put

404
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
fingers to keyboard

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,039
now there is one thing that I want to

406
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
add here and that is that plain language

407
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,120
can do a huge amount to help people with

408
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,580
lower levels of literacy as well as

409
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,380
people who are just bombarded and

410
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,440
overwhelmed with information every day

411
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,980
but that isn't enough for everyone

412
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,919
some groups might still be excluded from

413
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,840
accessing that information

414
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,419
and that includes people with very low

415
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,020
levels of literacy as well as those with

416
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,520
um specific disabilities or reading and

417
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,840
comprehension difficulties

418
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,340
so when we're writing things like

419
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,440
instructional texts and public

420
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,720
information documents so I don't

421
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,580
necessarily just mean Public public

422
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,960
information but think information

423
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,640
documents that you need everybody in

424
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,520
your organization to understand we might

425
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,320
need to go one step further than plain

426
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,419
language for these groups

427
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,600
that may include publishing alternative

428
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,880
formats such as audio or it might mean

429
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,700
producing easy or simple language

430
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,400
documents that are specifically designed

431
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,100
for those groups developed in

432
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,500
collaboration with them as well that's a

433
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,480
really important factor for easy and

434
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,240
simple language documents

435
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,520
that is beyond the scope of my talk

436
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,059
today but I just wanted to include it

437
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,520
because I think it's important that

438
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,100
while plain language does a lot through

439
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,700
improving accessibility it doesn't make

440
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,160
a text universally accessible

441
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
now

442
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,980
as with all the good things there is a

443
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,280
standard coming for plain language

444
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,000
um actually there's been a standard in

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,960
um

446
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,179
in pipeline for a very long time as you

447
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,919
can see here

448
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,919
um in 2010 the international plain

449
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,559
language Federation organizations

450
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,820
proposed the development of a standard

451
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,400
for the plain language now this standard

452
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,919
as the wording is it's plain language so

453
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,160
this is a universal standard it is not a

454
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,039
plain English Standard and it is tries

455
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,179
to be as language agnostic as it can

456
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,299
um the proposal for the development of

457
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,120
an ISO standard plain language was

458
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,960
approved in 2019 and since then there's

459
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,419
a technical working group uh that has

460
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,760
been working on developing the standard

461
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,340
which is representing 18 countries and

462
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,799
around 20 languages

463
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,659
um there

464
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,120
the standard itself is due to be

465
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,880
published later this year so

466
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,919
um probably

467
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,220
um mid to late summer now

468
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,100
um we're talking but because this is a

469
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,159
security community and we live that

470
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,440
standards coming out of our ears I

471
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
thought I'd share that we're not the

472
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,820
only people with a lot of Standards

473
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,480
um

474
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,880
so yeah plain language standard is is

475
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,700
coming we can all uh knock our socks off

476
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,299
with that later

477
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,000
so that's the theory and the

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,380
justification

479
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,419
for plain language

480
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,980
but how do we go about writing clearly

481
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,440
how do we go about implementing plain

482
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,780
language principles so that we can be

483
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,940
more easily understood

484
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,100
what steps can we take towards writing

485
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,720
in plain language

486
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,179
well in the words of Sir Ernest gowers

487
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,240
be short be simple

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,520
be human

489
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,799
just to put that into context

490
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,159
um so Ernest Gower was a member of the

491
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,419
Civil Service in the UK in the 30s 40s

492
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:43,559
and 50s

493
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,120
and he published the first plain English

494
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,380
guide essentially for uh the use of the

495
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,440
Civil Service and the UK government

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,580
um I don't know if you can see this but

497
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,740
it's called plain wood

498
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,400
um

499
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,340
my copies quite well marked and and

500
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,380
things it's um it's a really useful

501
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,140
guide for plain English

502
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,700
um writing

503
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,220
and it stands up to the against the test

504
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,200
of time as well though it has had a

505
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,919
couple of provisions

506
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,820
so

507
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,820
be short this means using short

508
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,340
sentences most of the time

509
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,320
and not really saying that much more

510
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,659
than we need to

511
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,720
being simple is about using simple

512
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,179
sentence structures not making things

513
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,659
too complex and also thinking about the

514
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,840
flow The Logical structure of our text

515
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,379
as well

516
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,240
explaining technical terms using simple

517
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,360
or familiar words for people

518
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,299
and sometimes depending on our audience

519
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,059
we might need to compromise the accuracy

520
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,700
of those explanations in order to help

521
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,380
someone understand a concept or

522
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,780
principle enough

523
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,460
to get through the rest of the document

524
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,559
and what we need them to know

525
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,500
and being human is about knowing who

526
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,100
your writing's for and what they need to

527
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,559
know or do

528
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,600
from the information that you've given

529
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,919
them

530
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,380
and it's about writing for your readers

531
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,440
using their language in ways that they

532
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,820
understand

533
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,679
I'm going to elaborate on all of those

534
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,380
over the next over the next few slides

535
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,179
so

536
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,740
be short

537
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,679
it's about preferring short and concise

538
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,299
sentences

539
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,700
and within one sentence kind of not

540
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,320
really saying that much more than you

541
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,100
need to

542
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,960
it isn't

543
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,980
um

544
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,039
it isn't taking away information though

545
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,900
so

546
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,020
in the the be short principle applies

547
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,059
more at a at a sentence level than a

548
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,039
full document level

549
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,880
when I've done plain English edits or

550
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,500
effectively plain English translations

551
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,620
for people sometimes the plain English

552
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,840
version of a document will be longer

553
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
than the original version

554
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,419
because if that document as a whole has

555
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,960
a lot of specialist language in their

556
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,559
specialist uh terminology I'm gonna have

557
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,480
to add

558
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
more wording to explain what that means

559
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,600
in order for the reader to be able to

560
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,100
move on to the next section of the

561
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,320
document and then to understand the

562
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,120
document as a whole

563
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,580
okay so this is only at a sentence level

564
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,700
being short

565
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,740
in your document you need to include

566
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,020
everything that you that you want to say

567
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,760
it isn't as I said at the beginning it

568
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,799
isn't about dumbing down information it

569
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,940
isn't about

570
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,460
um distilling things to the

571
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,980
um eating you know to a level that

572
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,200
they're no longer meaningful in fact

573
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,500
that is by far not the objective of

574
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
plain language

575
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,620
if I just show you the example that's on

576
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,960
the slide here uh we have diversity and

577
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,900
Synergy enhance the bandwidth of

578
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,240
Strategic Mission critical tiger teams

579
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,940
to touch base shift paradigms leverage

580
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,919
best practices think outside the box and

581
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,539
push the envelope

582
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,240
when all we're really trying to say is

583
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,100
that a well-run company gives decision

584
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,059
makers the time to solve problems

585
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,820
um

586
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,559
the there is a challenge when it comes

587
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,820
to

588
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,159
um short sentences all the time though

589
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
and that is that if we only use

590
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,020
sentences that are a single Clause at a

591
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,279
time

592
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,220
our text can start to sound very robotic

593
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,179
so it is fine to to flex that about a

594
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,740
little bit but the preference should

595
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,539
always be for shorter sentences and

596
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,539
ideally one one concept or principle per

597
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,000
sentence

598
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,059
as sentences get longer

599
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,100
there's more chance of them becoming

600
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,600
confusing

601
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,720
because we start to overload them with

602
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,240
too much information

603
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,760
we might start to add lots of dependent

604
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,980
details that could just as easily be in

605
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,659
a separate sentence

606
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,760
to explain that one I've got an example

607
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,279
so the committee which had to provide a

608
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,140
quorum decision including consent from

609
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,539
the CEO and CFO to approve the proposal

610
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,059
was due to me till Friday

611
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,240
what we're actually including in that

612
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,419
one sentence there is an explanation

613
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,260
about how the approval process for a

614
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,200
decision works

615
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,940
plus some additional information about

616
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,880
who needs to be involved in that

617
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,200
um approval

618
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,840
and then the the core message is that

619
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,400
the committee is due to meet on Friday

620
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,919
but it's quite hard to access that core

621
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,440
message because there's so much stuff

622
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,480
shoved in the middle of it

623
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,299
the other thing that we get with longer

624
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,039
sentences and this one's an example of

625
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,500
of it is that

626
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,159
we it can get some sort of ambiguities

627
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,960
creep in it's much much easier for

628
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,539
ambiguities to creep in the longer

629
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,240
uh sentences become

630
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,080
so in this case does the Quorum decision

631
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,779
mean that the CEO and CFO form part of

632
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,100
that quorum

633
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,380
or are they in addition to it so does

634
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,240
the committee provide a quorum and then

635
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,480
the CEO and CFO go to go on to approve

636
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,940
it so if we were translating this into

637
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,860
more plain language we might say that

638
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,240
um

639
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,340
approvals

640
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,520
or proposal approvals

641
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
had to be submit have to be submitted to

642
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,000
a committee full stop

643
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,059
the committee has to provide a quorum

644
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,580
decision

645
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,520
and and then clarifying whether we mean

646
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,760
in and the Quorum includes the CEO and

647
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,159
CFO or that they are in addition to the

648
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,240
quorum

649
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,299
full stop the committee is due or was

650
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,940
due to meet on Friday okay so we've got

651
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,980
gone from one sentence to three but what

652
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,220
we've done is separate out that mush of

653
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,059
information into a more distinct parts

654
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,679
and another thing that uh particularly

655
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,720
in in English and in in a slightly

656
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,480
different way in in other languages we

657
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,600
we end up doing is using too many words

658
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,779
or elements in the subject we see this

659
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,720
quite most commonly in journalistic

660
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,240
writing but it does creep in all over

661
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,460
the place the example that I've got here

662
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,520
is is more from a journalistic

663
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,220
standpoint so isolated instances of

664
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,559
terrorist outfits manipulating the stock

665
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,880
market to raise funds for their

666
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,820
operations have been reported

667
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,240
everything before the word have in that

668
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,940
sentence is the subject

669
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,240
the longer the subject is the harder it

670
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,020
becomes to to keep hold as a reader of

671
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,840
who is doing the thing

672
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,500
and even identifying who who is doing

673
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,720
the thing

674
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,760
in the first place can be really tricky

675
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
depending on on how that

676
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,020
um subject is described so that's that's

677
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,960
something also to just you know to be

678
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,240
aware of these problems tend to go away

679
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,020
when we think more in in short and

680
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,559
concise sentences

681
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,480
the next one be simple

682
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,740
so I started by saying you simple words

683
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,240
but that's really not the best way to

684
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,860
describe this

685
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,220
it is more about providing familiar

686
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,480
words

687
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,840
and that's familiar to your audience not

688
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,539
necessarily what you consider to be

689
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,080
familiar

690
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,980
it's about avoiding jargon terms if we

691
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,240
can

692
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,640
um sometimes those jargon terms

693
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,700
particularly in our industry I think

694
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,080
um sit somewhere between jargon and

695
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,100
um

696
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,100
our specialist vocabulary

697
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,559
and

698
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,080
where that's the case you know the

699
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,380
treat it as if it was a technical term

700
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,200
and explain provide a definition provide

701
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,299
an explanation in familiar language

702
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,480
for any terms that your audience may be

703
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,120
less familiar with and as I also

704
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,100
mentioned earlier on

705
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,039
it can be worth adding these familiar

706
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,260
language or plain language everyday

707
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,419
language

708
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,159
explanations for things

709
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,679
even when we're talking between our

710
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,580
peers

711
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,020
because

712
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,820
we all have we all have a slightly

713
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,480
different way of understanding

714
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,760
everything and of way of understanding

715
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,580
the terms that we have within our

716
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,220
industry depending on our specialism

717
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,039
okay and so it can help to things like

718
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,679
Cloud for example Cloud can mean so many

719
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,500
different things so including a brief

720
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,260
explanation of that in your in your

721
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,320
document even if you're writing for your

722
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,080
peers so also security people also

723
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,840
technology people can help just to make

724
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,539
sure that everyone has a common

725
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,940
understanding but that word in your

726
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,480
document okay it it it's that is

727
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,919
supporting your reader and understanding

728
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,200
what you're trying to say

729
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,399
foreign

730
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,520
I also mentioned earlier that sometimes

731
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,779
it is worth compromising the accuracy of

732
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:16,140
an explanation if it helps someone

733
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,000
understand a concept that they need to

734
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,240
be able to to get the information from

735
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,840
the document that that they're reading

736
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,899
and so as an example

737
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,019
if you're talking to a non-technical

738
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,260
person someone who doesn't have much

739
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,899
Network understanding

740
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,980
um they have a phone but they you know

741
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,320
it's a bit alien

742
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
um you may

743
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,360
just hypothetically need to explain what

744
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,820
a firewall is to them now if we're

745
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,220
talking to our peers we would need to

746
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,440
explain what type of firewall where it's

747
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,899
sitting what its function is

748
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:01,760
um

749
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,380
maybe what configuration we're applying

750
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,820
to it all of these things but the

751
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,019
biggest the most important thing is you

752
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,339
would need to specify the type of

753
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,320
firewall for that to be likely

754
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,599
meaningful

755
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,839
for someone who

756
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:17,099
you're you're trying to share some

757
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,619
General Security knowledge you might

758
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,859
explain a firewall as

759
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,679
um a barrier between their computer and

760
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
the internet between the organization

761
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,780
and the internet or between

762
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,260
um sensitive data and other parts of the

763
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,560
business and that may well be enough

764
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,139
they now have a concept for what the

765
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,800
firewall does that they understand and

766
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,359
that can then get you on to the point of

767
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,760
you maybe saying and we need one or we

768
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
need budget for some more we need to

769
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,418
upgrade ours because now they understand

770
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:57,139
in their terms in familiar terms

771
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,119
the purpose of that thing

772
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,940
um of the firewall

773
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,160
so moving on I just wanted to share a

774
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,700
couple of examples here now of what um

775
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,279
plain language can do to to a sentence

776
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,480
so the first one when introducing new

777
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,520
technology we will Implement a robust

778
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,280
change management process all of us here

779
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,440
will use a phrase like that without even

780
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,000
thinking about it because the change

781
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,680
management process for us we instantly

782
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,380
know all of the steps that are in there

783
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,220
what people uh listening or reading that

784
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,859
sentence might need to take away is that

785
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,660
when we make a change we're just going

786
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,460
to do it carefully

787
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,700
okay fine the next one the department is

788
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,440
leveraging feedback to Benchmark

789
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,540
satisfaction levels utilizing the

790
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,400
outcomes for the previous year so this

791
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,260
one's a nice like

792
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,119
um

793
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:53,160
marketing salesy type thing the

794
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,020
department is using feedback to compare

795
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,820
customer satisfaction levels to last

796
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,839
year

797
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,180
or employee satisfaction levels for last

798
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,760
year or whatever whoever's and that's

799
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,920
not actually clear so

800
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,740
you know you can see we've just taken

801
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,619
out all of the garbage business language

802
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,020
um in there and just

803
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,760
straightforward to the point and then

804
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,520
anybody that's worked with consultancies

805
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,020
or

806
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,300
um any type of Consulting and where

807
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,579
agency whether that's security or or

808
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,640
otherwise will I'm sure seeing some kind

809
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,800
of line like the last one we Endeavor to

810
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,540
fulfill our duties in accordance with

811
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,420
the Zenith of professionalism meaning

812
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,520
we aim to deliver our work to the higher

813
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,839
standard

814
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,760
um so just say that because everyone

815
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,140
understands what you mean you don't

816
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,579
sound

817
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:42,359
um

818
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,820
you know it

819
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,760
yeah you don't sound like such an idiot

820
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,540
okay so moving on be human so before I

821
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,579
talk to this slide I am very aware that

822
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,680
there is quite a lot of words in the

823
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,720
cartoon so I'm just going to explain the

824
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,480
cartoon so you can concentrate on

825
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,079
um the point of the slide the cartoon is

826
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,060
um is about some is some dinosaurs and

827
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,599
they're talking about the fact that in

828
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,579
English we don't

829
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:19,619
uh in some ways of some schools of

830
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,339
thought we don't have a gender neutral

831
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:25,560
single person pronoun

832
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,859
they recognize that uh

833
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,300
they

834
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,060
is being used for that purpose but argue

835
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,200
that

836
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,839
um they is plural which is what the um

837
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,140
prescript more prescriptive grammarians

838
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,119
would have us believe

839
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,040
um and they say well we should have some

840
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,099
others and there's been other pronouns

841
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,560
um invented to fill this Gap so there's

842
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,220
uh here free zthon

843
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,260
um and they decide that they like Thon

844
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,640
Okay so

845
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,619
that's what the slide is about that will

846
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:01,859
that's what the cartoon is it all makes

847
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,320
sense later on

848
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,500
being human is about knowing who you're

849
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,460
writing for and why you're writing

850
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,220
and that's about what you need either

851
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,560
what they need to know or do or what you

852
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,160
need them to do okay but when we're

853
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,200
doing this we need to put the reader

854
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,520
first and we need to write a language

855
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,980
that they understand that means that

856
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,380
we will be writing

857
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,300
um

858
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,520
we might write this if we were writing

859
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,740
the same thing for different groups of

860
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,680
people we would and we would need they

861
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,240
would the outcomes would look different

862
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,119
okay we wouldn't write we we wouldn't

863
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,180
write the same document for our

864
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,640
engineering teams who understand a lot

865
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,680
more technical language and we would

866
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,099
um for our

867
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,160
uh you know a more more people-based

868
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,118
team for example

869
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,960
uh and one of the the big things with

870
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,200
this is uh to make sure that we're being

871
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,839
inclusive it's about checking our biases

872
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,740
and it's also uh really as much of being

873
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,380
inclusive it's about

874
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,339
um

875
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,240
not being unintentionally exclusive

876
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,359
okay so that's where the the pronoun

877
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,119
slide of the dinosaurs comes in

878
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,859
um

879
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,260
we have he and she

880
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,320
and in order to be inclusive some people

881
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,599
think it's fine to go he's flashy that

882
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,820
covers

883
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,320
both

884
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,780
Sexes those genders

885
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,640
thing is there's a massive group of

886
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,560
people that sits in the middle of in the

887
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,359
middle of that or either side of that or

888
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,300
not within that at all and

889
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,599
um they have is generally now considered

890
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,839
to be a more inclusive term because it

891
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,599
allows for a spectrum there's no binary

892
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,540
heat she there's this wide spectrum

893
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,540
and then within security terms things

894
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,180
like preferring primary and secondary

895
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,880
instead of Master and slave and

896
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,540
allowless deny list rather than uh

897
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,079
whitelist and Blacklist

898
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,040
it's about

899
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
um just not unintentionally excluding

900
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,180
people or alienating people in the

901
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,400
things that we're writing I've included

902
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
a link to a really good resource here

903
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,760
and the conscious style guide that

904
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,800
Aggregates loads of online resources

905
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,960
about writing

906
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,619
um

907
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,599
for inclusivity

908
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,180
it also includes information

909
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,400
accessibility as well and there are

910
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,680
specific

911
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,619
resources on there for um

912
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,400
I.T technology language as well so it's

913
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,780
a really cool resource to go and look at

914
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,460
I think the other thing with with being

915
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,980
human is about recognizing that that's

916
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,640
exactly what we are we are human and

917
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,760
when we are

918
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,099
going through education

919
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,440
we're often taught

920
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,579
um to write incredibly formally and as

921
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,720
we progress through academic studies uh

922
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,180
University and research and things like

923
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,260
that

924
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,160
um

925
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,500
that just gets more and more ingrained

926
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,760
and so

927
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,220
when we leave Academia we've been sort

928
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,200
of indoctrinated into this sort of

929
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,720
academic style of writing it's

930
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,780
incredibly formal you you big words

931
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,119
however is therefore

932
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,040
um you know and all of this stuff it

933
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,720
makes very messy writing uh

934
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,320
in in no small part because often we're

935
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,280
given a word count Target for the

936
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,320
dissertation or whatever it is that we

937
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,060
have to produce and so we've had it with

938
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,220
all of this filler language and then

939
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,160
when we moved to into business we hear

940
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,099
all this kind of buzz stuff going around

941
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,359
so we we and and so we sort of we take

942
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,119
it all in and we reflect what we hear

943
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,760
and read elsewhere in our own writing as

944
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,560
well so it is just thinking about those

945
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,960
things and going hang on

946
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,740
if I'm I wouldn't say this stuff to

947
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,020
anyone so why am I writing it in that

948
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,820
way uh

949
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,160
just I think that's a really

950
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,740
um useful just thing to catch yourself

951
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,879
on a little bit

952
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,280
there are other considerations that go

953
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,660
into uh plain language writing beyond

954
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,500
the words that we use and they fall into

955
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,220
to categories of layout and design so

956
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,740
this is things like using headings and

957
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,000
subheadings and breaking up into smaller

958
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,440
sections

959
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,560
and and as I said before making sure

960
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,180
that there's a logical flow to those

961
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,319
sections

962
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:16,859
and actually the discipline of of having

963
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,640
to create sections will help that logic

964
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,160
you to process uh that logic flow as

965
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,000
well

966
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,099
um which can help you then to explain

967
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,380
something better in the future because

968
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,720
that logic flow is more ingrained for

969
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,819
you too

970
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,640
use of color as well that makes it that

971
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,319
can make a difference

972
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,220
um

973
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,740
not so much when we're just doing you

974
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,800
know uh standard text but if you are

975
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,319
using Color one thing to be aware of is

976
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,380
there is sufficient contrast between the

977
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,780
colors that you're using some colors are

978
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,380
difficult to you know to take to to

979
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,319
handle reading in in any

980
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,940
um great amount

981
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,599
and some people can't access color and

982
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,579
um if we fail to check that that

983
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,660
contrast is sufficient it can suddenly

984
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,540
mean that they are excluded from that

985
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,300
information okay there are plenty of

986
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,500
tools online that you can use to check

987
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,099
um

988
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,119
a color palette and that uh that you can

989
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,240
also apply filters that check that those

990
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,900
color palettes for contrast and for

991
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,960
um accessibility of people who have

992
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,300
different forms of color blindness so

993
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,880
um yeah I if if anyone's interested in

994
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,640
those drop me a note and I'll I'll put

995
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,260
something up in the

996
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,240
um in Hoover after

997
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,880
font Choice again another important

998
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,060
consideration here so font Choice might

999
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,520
be the size of the font so you know if

1000
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,319
you have to write a paper if it's your

1001
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,240
organization and have been in places

1002
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,040
that say this if you have to write a

1003
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,560
paper and it has to be no longer than

1004
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,420
four sides long and shrinking it down to

1005
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,300
font size six to make it fit

1006
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,240
isn't going to be great for getting

1007
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,760
people to read what you've written in

1008
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,180
the first place so just you know be a

1009
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,880
publishing standard is equivalent to

1010
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,020
Aerial font size 12 and then with uh you

1011
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,780
know a slightly with a wider than one

1012
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,060
um

1013
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,160
slightly wider than single spaced lines

1014
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,720
as well just don't be afraid of

1015
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,520
stretching the lines out so that so that

1016
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,040
text is just easier it's easier to

1017
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,260
separate the lines out it's faster for

1018
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,980
somebody to read

1019
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,099
representing uh information in diagrams

1020
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,380
tables and illustrations instead of in

1021
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,660
words where that is more appropriate to

1022
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,880
do just do that

1023
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,859
um illustrations can be useful as well

1024
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,460
just to help to break up text as well

1025
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,500
um but yeah don't be afraid of including

1026
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,099
diagrams and white space particularly if

1027
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,740
what you're sharing is going to be read

1028
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,740
on a screen where you don't need to

1029
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,200
worry about the cost of printing and ink

1030
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,520
and

1031
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,380
um you know and all of that stuff just

1032
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,359
make sure that there is white today so

1033
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,300
if in your sections that there is a

1034
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,760
wider space between each above each

1035
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,420
heading and a little Gap slightly wider

1036
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,700
than your standard text width um between

1037
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,740
subheadings and the remaining content

1038
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,260
using bullet points and and things like

1039
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,540
that as well instead of comma separated

1040
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,000
lists like put those in bullet points it

1041
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,680
all adds white space

1042
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,380
for what that actually does might make

1043
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,420
the number of pages longer but it makes

1044
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,760
your document much faster to read

1045
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,359
because it sort of Pops information into

1046
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,920
into people's

1047
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,560
um mind a lot a lot faster and then I

1048
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,420
mentioned briefly um as well or

1049
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,000
alternative formats for

1050
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,579
um accessibility reasons that's

1051
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:03,960
stretching just a little bit beyond the

1052
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,920
scope of this of this talk but audio

1053
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,579
um

1054
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,980
is is definitely one

1055
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,400
uh that can be quite straightforward to

1056
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,839
do

1057
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,700
um but yeah just make sure that you're

1058
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,720
aware of any groups that might need

1059
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,160
alternative formats for information

1060
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,599
so

1061
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,900
uh I hope that this has been kind of

1062
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,400
useful presentation probably a bit

1063
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,760
different from a lot of the talks over

1064
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,740
the last couple of days

1065
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,040
um but I think that language is really

1066
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,260
important because communication is the

1067
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,500
core of what we do in security

1068
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,200
we do some incredible things within

1069
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,500
security and as Security Professionals

1070
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,440
um but I think it's sad that so many of

1071
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,359
us in the profession end up feeling

1072
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,140
incredibly frustrated by it because we

1073
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,880
don't necessarily get the buy-in and

1074
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,339
support and engagement from the people

1075
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,020
that we work with

1076
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,960
and a lot of that is down to

1077
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,839
a difficulty in explaining what we're

1078
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,300
doing explaining things

1079
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,819
um so that they understand

1080
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,819
um and can provide that support to us

1081
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,020
so

1082
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,140
in today's talk I've um explained a bit

1083
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,119
about what plain language is

1084
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,500
and uh how it can kind of help us

1085
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,960
um it can help to save time money and

1086
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,839
resources through it being faster for

1087
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,880
people to get the information we need

1088
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,339
them to understand and make a decision

1089
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:44,460
or to use that information

1090
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,240
um

1091
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,079
that saves so much time and energy for

1092
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,440
us as well because we're not having to

1093
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,540
do so much backwards and forwards to

1094
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,300
explain and clarify things can help to

1095
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,800
improve compliance because if people

1096
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,900
understand what we need them to do they

1097
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,540
are more likely to do it and it affects

1098
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,180
customer satisfaction whether that's an

1099
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,220
End customer or a client or internal

1100
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,319
people that we work with day in day out

1101
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,660
because uh we're just suddenly a bit

1102
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,260
more approachable and accessible and

1103
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,780
less scary and less overwhelming

1104
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,460
uh I I've also provided you with lots of

1105
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,980
practical tips for writing more clearly

1106
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,160
I've tried to keep these as

1107
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,380
um General as possible so that they

1108
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,140
don't just apply to English although my

1109
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,740
examples have all been in English

1110
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,640
um so in summary for that be short you

1111
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,040
can pull be human

1112
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,980
and I just want to close uh my talk with

1113
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,780
the quote on the page don't

1114
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,700
underestimate your reader's intelligence

1115
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,160
but don't overestimate their knowledge

1116
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,740
of a particular field when writing about

1117
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,420
science don't simplify the science

1118
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,819
simplify the writing

1119
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:05,700
and if we swap the word for security I

1120
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,660
think

1121
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,380
that this is um definitely a principle

1122
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,140
that we can take away

1123
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,420
when writing about security don't

1124
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,119
simplify the security simplify the

1125
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,480
writing

1126
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,420
so if you uh want to get in touch with

1127
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,839
me I've put my details on the slide here

1128
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,880
um as well as

1129
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,680
couple of links

1130
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,839
um related to plain language so there's

1131
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,579
a plain language Association there's

1132
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:37,800
loads of plain language resources

1133
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,619
um on there and I've also linked to that

1134
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,380
survey of adult skills which

1135
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,500
um I showed the literacy data from as

1136
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,059
well

1137
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,700
this is my grown-up Twitter handle

1138
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,920
um my other Twitter handle is fairy

1139
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,300
cakepixie

1140
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,200
um as well so yeah and with that thank

1141
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:58,980
you

1142
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,980
very much for listening and

1143
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,780
uh yeah is there any questions

1144
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,839
yeah thank you um for the uh the

1145
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,260
interesting sessions uh very insightful

1146
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,420
um I see there are no questions in the Q

1147
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,180
a but I've got two of them

1148
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,579
um explain

1149
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:22,200
language appropriate when writing for

1150
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,740
technical teams about technical subjects

1151
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,260
yeah yeah so

1152
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,000
um when we're writing

1153
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,900
for our peers it's really about making

1154
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,020
sure that

1155
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,160
they can take in information really

1156
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,680
quickly and plain language can help us

1157
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,980
to do that it can also help just with

1158
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,540
um

1159
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,220
one of the things that I mentioned was

1160
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,740
that we

1161
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,260
individually can have very subtly

1162
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,800
different understanding of what a word

1163
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,900
means what a term means what it applies

1164
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,040
to

1165
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,740
um and so even though

1166
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,559
we share a common language in this case

1167
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,839
of security

1168
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:09,000
um it there can still be a lot of value

1169
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,319
in just clarifying within this text this

1170
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:16,020
is what this term means

1171
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,579
and and that just helps uh to get rid of

1172
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:21,780
some of that

1173
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,300
um ambiguity or the risk for something

1174
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,940
to be misinterpreted

1175
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,020
um

1176
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,540
yeah so

1177
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,720
yeah okay thank you for that

1178
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,400
um and the second one plain language

1179
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,540
helps readers how how does it helps us

1180
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,900
when we're writing

1181
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,920
uh so as writing it's as far as writing

1182
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,280
goes we don't have to try to seek that

1183
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,960
sort of elevated

1184
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,780
um academic style of writing that we

1185
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,940
like I say we can often end up being

1186
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,619
indoctrinated into

1187
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:01,740
we can can right more like we would

1188
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,559
speak to someone in a meeting and that

1189
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,619
can take a bit less brain power to do

1190
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,839
um it takes a bit of practice because

1191
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,359
we're so used to

1192
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,000
you know creating formal papers and

1193
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,900
formal documentation and and speaking to

1194
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,540
certain people in in a really formal way

1195
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,099
that

1196
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:23,760
um

1197
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,859
plain language it doesn't mean that that

1198
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:29,040
you're not respectful polite and all of

1199
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,559
those things in what you're saying

1200
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,059
um but it just means that what you've

1201
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,980
said is really clear

1202
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,760
um and easy to understand the people

1203
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,540
um

1204
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,460
so I think

1205
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,359
um

1206
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,420
as writers as well the one of the

1207
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,099
biggest benefits that we can get from

1208
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,980
from it is just that what we've written

1209
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,839
is understood and people do what we need

1210
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:55,619
them to do with what we've written

1211
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:59,280
um so that's it particularly in security

1212
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,500
I think is one of the biggest benefits

1213
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,079
that we can get from it

1214
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,440
yeah indeed that's very clear

1215
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,200
um so yeah I want to thank you um for uh

1216
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,720
for this session and uh

1217
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,000
it's time to wrap up

1218
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,660
thank you thank you thank you

1219
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,099

1220
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,119
