1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,019
okay well good morning good uh afternoon

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,960
or maybe even good evening

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
I hope everybody can can understand me

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,800
well

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,699
and um so I'm Tim the book uh and we're

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,900
in this session today on API security

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,320
and I'm gonna give you uh an approach

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,380
let's say uh to API security that is uh

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,800
that is actually based on uh on risk

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,100
uh hello team before uh you do that I

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,899
can maybe provide a short introduction

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,780
to you at this session if that sounds

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,540
good there was a bit of delays for me to

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,460
be able to join as panelists so I'm here

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,420
now

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,579
so I'll just give a short brief intro

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,980
before we can take it away

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,960
um so hello everyone first of all

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,399
welcome to ovasp appsec EU 2022 and the

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,920
exhibitor track my name is Christina

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,260
devochko and I will be I'm a volunteer

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,960
in the ovas community and I will be your

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,780
moderator for this session today

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,880
um during the next 45 minutes you will

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,700
be listening to uh Team the back who

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,340
will present the session on a risk-based

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,159
approach to API security so please

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,560
submit any questions you have during the

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,320
session in the Q and A tab just to the

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,540
right of this video in the Hoover

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,880
platform I will be asking Tim your

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,100
questions in the last 10 minutes of the

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,880
session

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,880
uh Team the back is the solutions or

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,579
architect with no name security and he

36
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,280
advises customers on technology and

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,979
process best practices to mitigate risks

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,799
originating from applications and apis

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,860
and prior to No Name security team held

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,500
similar roles at Palo Alto networks and

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,860
IBM with 25 years of experience in

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,020
information security and Enterprise

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,320
security architecture

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,899
so are you ready to take it away Tim

45
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,000
yes I think I am thank you Christina

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,098
awesome thank you

47
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,199
perfect and I I suppose everybody can

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,819
see the screen right uh because this is

49
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,099
my first session so uh I'm not sure

50
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,379
everything works

51
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,379
um I I can see it just a heads up okay

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,739
perfect thank you then let's let's go

53
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,920
um so um yeah again thank you Christina

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,780
for the introduction

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,000
um the idea for this session is to give

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
you an insight into uh into API security

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,819
but we're going to take a risk-based

58
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,780
approach

59
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,200
and so uh in the uh in the session here

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,540
we're actually going to discuss uh some

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,920
of the challenges and risks that

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,900
actually come with the traditional

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,300
application security architectures and

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,980
uh we'll also explore some critical

65
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,800
capabilities for modern risk-based

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,019
approach to API security

67
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,540
um focusing on the entire API lifecycle

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,300
so that's kind of the abstract for today

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,459
um Christina already uh was kind enough

70
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,980
to to introduce me so I'm not going to

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,200
go into the details here

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
um so let's Dive In

73
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
and what I'd like to do is first of all

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,319
kind of set the scene

75
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,000
um so everybody's on the on the same

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,040
page I'll uh I'll give a brief

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,080
introduction on you know uh what is an

78
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
API uh first of all and then we'll dive

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,120
into uh you know an understanding of of

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,879
risk and uh we'll we'll explore what

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,800
that means in the context of API

82
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
security

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,599
so um as uh many of you will probably uh

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,659
already be familiar with with apis

85
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,040
um not going to spend too much time on

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,799
this but um just for your reference if

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,440
we are talking about an API uh we talk

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
about an application programming

89
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,739
interface

90
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,319
it's uh it's uh something that's

91
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,540
basically facilitates communication

92
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,819
between uh software components between

93
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,459
applications between devices

94
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,440
um by by offering a standardized

95
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,879
interface

96
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,040
through which functions and data are

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,400
easily accessible as an example you know

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,680
everybody has uh has mobile apps on

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
their phone

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,700
um all of these apps actually are you

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
know in the in the background are

102
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,440
accessing apis to obtain information to

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,639
to give you certain types of

104
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,040
functionality for example you know

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,979
checking the weather or making

106
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,199
transactions uh through your financial

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,080
institution uh everything of those

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,900
functionalities is today actually

109
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,520
enabled by apis

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,780
on a more technical note uh an API or a

111
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,580
server-side web API because that's

112
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,139
essentially what we're talking about

113
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,780
here is a is a programmatic interface

114
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,199
and uh that interface exposes endpoints

115
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,780
and so each endpoint can take requests

116
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,940
and then we'll return a response and

117
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,180
that response can be data if if you're

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,300
acquiring a data system or it could

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,120
basically be informing you that that you

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,620
know you've successfully run a function

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,139
uh you requested something to to happen

122
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,259
in the in the underlying system

123
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,639
um for example checking a credit card

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,620
number and then the response would come

125
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,000
back and say it's a valid credit card

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,100
number or it's uh it's a fake credit

127
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,800
card number um these are examples of how

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,139
you can use apis today

129
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,600
and um we'll go a bit more into you know

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,120
what the consequences are of that

131
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,900
um obviously you know from uh uh from uh

132
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,440
let's say uh usability or or prevalence

133
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,139
perspective uh we have some some figures

134
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,100
here

135
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,800
that actually give you some insight into

136
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,100
you know what the what the let's say

137
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,280
level of magnitude is uh of apis being

138
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,680
used today and

139
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,199
from that you know uh from that respect

140
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,199
we can see that uh for example today if

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,320
if you look at API usage the the usage

142
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,520
is actually

143
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,979
um increasing exponentially so we did a

144
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,039
survey recently with a 451 group

145
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,380
um and uh we we actually asked them to

146
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,500
you know uh do a bit of research uh

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,600
query a lot of a lot of people in the

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,780
field and uh you know come come back

149
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,699
with a set of data that we could use and

150
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,100
pour into the report and so from from

151
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,320
the report itself we actually see that

152
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,240
over the last 12 months for all the

153
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,699
people that we've interviewed

154
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,280
um they they saw an increase of over 200

155
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,340
percent of uh apis being you know

156
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,900
created and deployed in their

157
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,580
environment

158
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,100
now with that reader use that greater

159
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,780
Scroll of apis

160
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,020
um you can obviously expect that uh that

161
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,600
will trigger an interest from uh people

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,520
with with you know rather malicious

163
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,919
intentions and so we also see that you

164
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,520
know attacks against apis are increasing

165
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,340
and so again from that same study

166
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,180
um we uh we recorded that basically in

167
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,280
the last 12 months

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,300
um 41 of the of the respondents had

169
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,360
actually seen uh or experienced an API

170
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,120
security incident and out of those 41

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
percent uh 63 actually experienced a

172
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
data breach or data loss as a result now

173
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,699
if you do the math on that

174
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,860
um that actually means that one in four

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,560
of the people that we interviewed was

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,080
actually the victim of a data breach

177
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,099
caused by an API a security flaw or an

178
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,680
API security development ability one in

179
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
four over a period of a year that's

180
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,039
that's not an insignificant number

181
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,860
and so it's it's also for that reason

182
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,259
um that uh you can see analyst firms

183
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,039
like Gartner uh really uh basically

184
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,460
saying that apis uh are the next big

185
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,039
attack surface uh when we come uh when

186
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,560
we look at at uh at threats from from

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,539
side of criminals for example and so

188
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,460
Gardner in there in the in one of their

189
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,500
latest reports uh where they look at the

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,860
Cyber threat landscape for 2022 uh they

191
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,199
actually designate apis as a high

192
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
momentum attacks which means that

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
they're no longer anecdotal so it

194
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,979
basically means that these are attached

195
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,020
you should take into account uh for the

196
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,379
next couple of years and they will not

197
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,819
they will not decrease they will only

198
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,740
increase

199
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,539
so that's kind of a you know a bit of

200
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,120
background on you know where we are with

201
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
respect to acis and um now I'm gonna

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,520
explain a little bit about you know how

203
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
we're gonna see this in the context of

204
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,779
uh of risk

205
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,360
um so you know first of all you know

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
really quick introduction on on what is

207
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,320
risk because there's there's you know

208
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,180
various ideas about you know what

209
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,640
constitutes risk and I've taken some

210
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,019
definitions here

211
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,920
from this and from uh from fair and from

212
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,019
uh uh ISO

213
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,660
um they are slightly different but also

214
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,060
in certain ways the same um basically in

215
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,420
eastern Fair they see uh risk as a as a

216
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,220
function of you know certain elements

217
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,360
and

218
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,600
um those elements uh largely are the uh

219
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,339
let's say the likelihood of occurrence

220
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,180
of a certain event that might happen

221
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,399
um and the adverse impact that that

222
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,839
event has

223
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,760
um so you know that's that's what this

224
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,339
basically has a definition for risk

225
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,680
um Fair which is an institution that you

226
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
know looks at risk quantification

227
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,560
basically includes also the the assets

228
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,660
and the controls that you have

229
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,760
um but in the end it basically comes

230
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
down to the same thing

231
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
um you are at a chance of you know

232
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,540
suffering from an event that would cause

233
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,360
an impact to your organization

234
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,120
um that may be you know significant for

235
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,100
the organization

236
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,019
um ISO takes a bit of a a different

237
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,540
angle uh they say you know risk is the

238
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,060
effect of uncertainty on objectives and

239
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,220
and in a certain way that also you know

240
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,600
applies to what we're going to discuss

241
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,740
here

242
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,140
um because right now if you look at at

243
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,399
API security there is I would say also a

244
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,620
lot of uncertainty about what API

245
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,620
security should be uh in order to you

246
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,779
know to be successful in in mitigating

247
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,880
risk

248
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,740
so that's kind of you know setting the

249
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,560
scene and I'm gonna go a little bit more

250
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,300
into the details now you know just to

251
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,279
basically take you on a journey and

252
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,200
explore risk a little bit further and

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,820
and then see you know how we can apply

254
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,000
that to uh however it relates to to API

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,320
security

256
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,360
um so if you if you look at risk and you

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,399
look at the core elements that can

258
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,339
constitute risk then you know first of

259
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,079
all there is the uh you know the

260
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,940
probability of something happening so

261
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,640
the likelihood of occurrence uh as as

262
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,380
missed calls it

263
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,200
um and and there you can you know look

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,779
at how often you expect a certain event

265
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:58,860
to happen

266
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,560
so for example the uh you know the

267
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,880
figures that we that we collected

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,500
through the interview

269
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
um where you know companies suffer from

270
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,399
a data breach you could say that you

271
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,440
know one in four companies

272
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,360
um on an annual basis suffers from a

273
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,100
data breach so your your probability

274
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,980
would be around 25 percent

275
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,060
and then the second element uh uh for uh

276
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,180
you know calculating risk uh is actually

277
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,480
the the impacts that a particular event

278
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
uh would would figure to your

279
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
organization so if you look at

280
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,260
probability and you you dive a little

281
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,399
bit deeper

282
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,140
um there obviously you see that

283
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,220
probability is let's say driven by on

284
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,500
the one hand side a particular threat

285
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,440
and on the other side uh you know the

286
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,600
the attack surface that is exposed to

287
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,740
the thread

288
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,720
and the impact

289
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
will be driven by a particular loss

290
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
event so that's that's effectively what

291
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,660
happens if the um the uh the threats

292
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
successfully exploits a vulnerability on

293
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,519
your attack surface it can trigger a

294
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,620
particular loss event such as a data

295
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,440
breach for example and that implies a

296
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,160
certain cost to the organization

297
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,160
and so you can go a bit more into the

298
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,839
details you can dive a little bit deeper

299
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,760
if you then explore

300
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,459
what effectively makes up a trip

301
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,220
then you can look at the uh you know

302
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,800
first of all the threat actors so you

303
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,820
know the folks that are actually

304
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,180
carrying out uh the attack but also

305
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,459
their motivations and the the the

306
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,440
techniques tactics and procedures that

307
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,820
they're using so the tools that they're

308
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,800
using and how they operate

309
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,519
um

310
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
all these elements together you know

311
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,500
make up the the elements of threat

312
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
on the attack surface side you can uh

313
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,320
you can then start looking at you know

314
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,860
your API footprint uh specifically and

315
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,300
then obviously

316
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,820
um apis are you know the first element

317
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,000
of your attack surface but then those

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,700
apis also bring certain vulnerabilities

319
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,380
to the table

320
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,899
um and basically your infrastructure can

321
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,680
also be at the risk of of

322
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,940
misconfigurations so something that we

323
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,000
very often see is uh is you know control

324
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,980
components that don't work as operated

325
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,040
or as intended and so you deal with

326
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,320
misconfigurations there as well

327
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,959
and then on the on the impact side if

328
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,440
you look at potential loss events

329
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,420
um you know first of all there is a data

330
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,060
breach uh obviously because that's the

331
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,480
one that most companies will will incur

332
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,660
as part of uh as part of an attack most

333
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,399
companies will suffer from a data breach

334
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,980
at least in the API security context

335
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,260
that's what we see with customers but

336
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,060
there's also other types of loss events

337
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,480
that that could be uh detrimental to a

338
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,000
company things such as for example

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,980
service disruption if you if you bring

340
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,839
down a service that could mean a loss of

341
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,200
Revenue and so uh that could be just as

342
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,959
as much of an impact in the end as a

343
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,480
data breach or maybe even bigger and

344
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,980
then there's other things like uh

345
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,360
function abuse

346
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,899
where you know regular uh functionality

347
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,600
that is offered through an API is is

348
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,540
being abused for purposes that were not

349
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,440
in the original intent of of that API

350
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,200
um I just gave an example of of credit

351
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,760
card validation

352
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,940
um that's a good use case for you know

353
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,700
uh cyber criminals to to start using a

354
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,680
function like that for their own you

355
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,899
know for their own benefits in for

356
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,940
example validating lists of stolen

357
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,399
credit card numbers

358
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,160
and so again that may have an impact uh

359
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,500
that may you know be tied to a

360
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,019
particular cost for the organization now

361
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,899
if we look at Cost then you know

362
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,339
obviously the first thing that comes to

363
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,420
mind is the um is the financial cost

364
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,220
um that's that what most organizations

365
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,920
will be worried about in the first place

366
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,139
but then besides Financial cost there

367
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,660
can be other types of cost implications

368
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,459
there could be a damage to your

369
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,279
reputation uh which may in in the end

370
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,579
also again result in for example loss of

371
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,100
Revenue uh and again contribute to that

372
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,120
Financial cost and then in certain cases

373
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,220
you could also deal with with a with a

374
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,560
humor cost for example if if you're

375
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,639
looking at industrial iot for example

376
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,579
um if you deal with uh a breach there

377
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,160
and certain functionalities impacted

378
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,120
that could effectively result in uh loss

379
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,660
of life or people getting injured

380
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,380
so this is you know at a at a very high

381
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,620
level how uh how we look at risk and and

382
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,260
what the different elements are that uh

383
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,639
basically uh

384
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,760
constitute risk what I'm going to do now

385
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,560
is you know take a little bit of a

386
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,800
deeper dive and and then

387
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,139
look at you know first of all the the

388
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,180
different loss events uh and the

389
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,279
potential cost implications and how you

390
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,620
can use those to determine the impact

391
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,779
and then we're going to take a closer

392
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,240
look at the the probability itself again

393
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
in the context of apis and see how that

394
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,199
may

395
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,720
basically help you or guide you in

396
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,600
determining the overall risk that uh

397
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,420
your API landscape brings to the

398
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,920
organization because that's you know

399
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,720
that's ultimately the goal

400
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,420
now if you want to uh determine impacts

401
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,519
then you know obviously you'll need some

402
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,519
more information on what exactly is it

403
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,820
that uh my organization is doing what

404
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,459
what type of business are we in what is

405
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,720
uh generating or driving or or Revenue

406
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,459
uh and and there it really depends on

407
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,079
you know again the type of organization

408
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,060
that you are in uh it's it's difficult

409
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,220
to predict for you know any particular

410
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,620
organization what their core risks may

411
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,820
be

412
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,520
um we did that for a certain number of

413
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,799
customers in the past but you're always

414
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,319
surprised to see that they take a

415
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,079
different angle from time to time and

416
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,720
um their you know prioritization of risk

417
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,299
may be different from what you expect

418
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,819
um so here you know if you look at the

419
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,140
the the the the impact drivers obviously

420
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,599
in uh in the context of an API as we

421
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,740
discussed already

422
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,360
um there is there is the biggest

423
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,160
potential is data test or that's at

424
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,820
least

425
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,620
what we're seeing today

426
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,900
um a lot of the breaches results in uh

427
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,419
in data being lost or data being stolen

428
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,100
so that's potentially the the biggest

429
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,440
driver for everybody uh but then as I

430
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,059
mentioned there's there's other drivers

431
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,120
or or other uh types of loss events

432
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,340
um such as service disruption function

433
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,820
abuse uh account takeover uh that could

434
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,700
in the end also result in you know lost

435
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,000
revenue or reputational damage or you

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
know potentially fines uh from from the

437
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,500
government Etc

438
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,299
um so this is this is you know the first

439
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,460
step that you typically take

440
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,580
is uh it's just trying to assess what

441
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,580
type of loss events will create the

442
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,160
biggest impact for my organization and

443
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,780
you can say for example a retail company

444
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,940
may suffer more if if ordering is

445
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,880
disrupted uh whereas a bank will will

446
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,940
typically focus more on financial fraud

447
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,280
um but again some of these loss events

448
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,260
may be very specific to your business

449
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,640
others uh maybe more you know broadly

450
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,700
applied and data test is one example

451
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,200
all right

452
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,179
now if we then look at

453
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,640
probability and and this is something

454
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,039
where you'll have a lot more elements to

455
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,320
uh to deal with if if you now look at

456
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,580
probability

457
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,299
um

458
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,179
and and look at what you need to know in

459
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,520
order to estimate the uh the probability

460
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,039
or the likelihood of occurrence of a you

461
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,620
know a successful API attack then first

462
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,000
of all there's the threat actors that

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,700
you need to be aware of now these threat

464
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,980
actors are no different from you know

465
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,020
threat actors that we see in in other

466
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,700
types of attacks like you know for

467
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,880
example uh the ransomware attacks

468
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,500
um you have cyber criminals they're in

469
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,480
there for monetary gain you have uh

470
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,600
activists that basically look in the

471
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,220
first case to do or to create brand

472
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,500
damage then you have Nation stage with

473
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,559
with an ancient states which are let's

474
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,620
say far more experienced and equipped

475
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,919
um and in in many cases they will you

476
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,820
know their first core objective is to

477
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,039
gain a competitive advantage over other

478
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,380
countries for example uh and then you

479
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,360
have opportunistic

480
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,020
um

481
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,539
hackers let's say where you actually

482
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,460
don't really know what you're going to

483
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,980
face it more depends on the type of

484
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,919
vulnerability they can exploit

485
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,380
so that's on the on the threat side and

486
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,419
then you have of course the uh the

487
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,980
attack surface itself

488
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,520
and there you know the the first uh

489
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,260
element to take into account is the uh

490
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,120
it's the apis that you have

491
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,100
um it can be you know many different

492
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,960
types of apis in your environment you

493
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,760
can have managed apis you can have

494
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,799
Shadow apis that you don't know about

495
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,080
that they are still up and running there

496
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,880
may be unmanaged apis there can be

497
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,700
third-party apis each of these will

498
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,559
offer a certain functionality whether

499
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,360
it's it's to the general public or to

500
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,799
your partners

501
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,240
or maybe to just internal employees but

502
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,179
each of these are a potential Target uh

503
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,919
for the threat actors that we just

504
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,059
discussed

505
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,340
and then besides the apis

506
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,940
obviously you also need to focus on the

507
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,160
vulnerabilities that

508
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,980
um that can be exploited on the you know

509
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,320
the uh the vulnerabilities the

510
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,179
misconfigurations

511
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,100
um that that could be present because of

512
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,280
these apis in your environment and so

513
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,980
that actually brings us to let's say the

514
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,100
first challenge that we observe

515
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,580
um in let's say the the the the

516
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,260
organizations that we talk to is that

517
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,140
there is a lack of awareness about what

518
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,740
effectively today is important uh to

519
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,559
define or to help Define uh the API

520
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,140
attack surface

521
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,539
and so the reason there or let's say the

522
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,760
observation that we uh that we've seen

523
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,919
is that uh that that lack of awareness

524
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,080
is

525
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,419
basically preventing companies from in

526
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,679
the first place

527
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,840
making the right assessment of where

528
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,539
their risk lies related to their API

529
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,960
landscape as an example here I've I've

530
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,740
taken the uh the the well-known wasp top

531
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,480
10.

532
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
um where you know if if you ask around

533
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
during uh during customer meetings for

534
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,780
example

535
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,380
um

536
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,419
pretty much everybody's aware with aware

537
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,460
of the of the ovas put them

538
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,500
but if you then say that there is a

539
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,380
there is a counterpart basically that is

540
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,760
specifically focusing on API issues then

541
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,460
in many cases you uh you can see that

542
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,700
people are not aware of of you know of

543
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,559
the fact that there is an additional API

544
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,020
top 10 and and they're even you know far

545
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,880
less aware of you know what what makes

546
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,620
up their top 10 what are the typical

547
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,559
issues that you see uh in in an API

548
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,000
environment

549
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,940
and so while there are you know

550
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,100
similarities there are you know certain

551
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,799
types of issues that actually uh exist

552
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,020
in boats or that at least make the top

553
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,200
ten uh in each of these lists

554
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,700
um these are the ones that that I've

555
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,919
highlighted in green here uh you also

556
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,179
see that there are uh quite a few issues

557
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,000
that are really specific to apis

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,860
um such as the broken object level

559
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,539
authorization issue which which

560
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,000
currently still stands at number one

561
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,880
um which is the you know the most common

562
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,679
uh vulnerability or the most common

563
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,980
problem that leads to uh data breaches

564
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,380
these days

565
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,539
and so you know this this is already the

566
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,820
first challenge that we see is because

567
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,360
you don't know of you know what actually

568
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,179
is important to know uh when we talk

569
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,179
about API security it's it's very very

570
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,220
let's say difficult

571
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,200
to

572
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,500
assess the the the or to get a good

573
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,080
estimation of that probability right

574
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,179
where are we vulnerable

575
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,000
if we don't know what we're

576
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
looking for in terms of vulnerabilities

577
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,039
so

578
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,440
the first thing that we uh you know that

579
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
we that we absolutely need to tackle is

580
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,360
is the awareness problem

581
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,260
um

582
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,600
and then of course you can uh you can

583
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,400
you can start diving into what is

584
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,620
exactly needed um but then the other

585
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,140
thing is that if we look at for example

586
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,720
the Olas API top 10

587
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,059
um for us this is a starting point right

588
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,919
this is something that that every

589
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,620
company should be looking at today

590
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,720
um but it's just a starting point right

591
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,820
it's it shouldn't be the end goal you

592
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,700
can't say I've now covered the uh you

593
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,159
know the the the the the the items in

594
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,159
this list and now I'm gonna be you know

595
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,740
perfectly safe from API attacks because

596
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,080
that's you know that's not how obviously

597
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,720
security Works um this list dates from

598
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,500
from from 2019 so it's not that old but

599
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,720
obviously things change certainly in the

600
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,059
domain of security and um we can already

601
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,760
see that there are other issues that you

602
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,039
know are going to surface in the uh in

603
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,260
the next coming years in terms of API

604
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,840
security that are currently not in that

605
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,059
top 10 list

606
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,159
but so again you know uh from an

607
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,679
awareness point of view uh this is a uh

608
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,600
you know a good point to start

609
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,880
um just you know do the reading

610
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,580
and uh and and look at what applies to

611
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,200
uh you know or what might potentially

612
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,140
apply to your environment

613
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,600
now in order to actually get there I'm

614
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,960
gonna go through an exercise where uh

615
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,880
we're gonna look at a particular threat

616
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,360
scenario and we're gonna look at in this

617
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,080
case you know uh a scenario of uh pii

618
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,900
Data Theft again in the context of you

619
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,080
know how apis might contribute to such a

620
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,760
scenario

621
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,140
so

622
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,080
again as as a first you know step in

623
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,580
this exercise

624
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,700
um what you typically do is you look at

625
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,620
the loss events that are

626
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,080
you know critical for your organization

627
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,900
and so in this case it's uh it's data

628
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,480
theft and we know that you know for data

629
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,159
test there can be fines there can be

630
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,779
brand damage there can be lost business

631
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,539
uh as a you know as a result as a cost

632
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,919
implication

633
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,860
and if we look at you know who the most

634
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,320
likely threat factor is you know for

635
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,419
that scenario it's uh it's cyber

636
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,100
criminals

637
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,679
and so then the only the only elements

638
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,140
that we're missing here are uh you know

639
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,059
the the elements that constitute or that

640
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,760
makeup or an attack surface and so here

641
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,679
you can look at you know all the

642
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,960
different uh or you can include all the

643
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,320
different uh types of vulnerabilities or

644
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,480
um you know attack techniques that might

645
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,020
eventually result in data being stolen

646
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,260
and these you know vulnerabilities they

647
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,440
can apply to you know a number of apis

648
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,820
that you have in your environments

649
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,799
whether they're public or partner or

650
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,080
apis you don't know about

651
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,179
um you just list you know what applies

652
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,880
to uh to your specific environment

653
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,440
all right

654
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,419
now with this you have you know the

655
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,000
first step in that uh in that exercise

656
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,520
you you've basically listed all the all

657
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,220
the components that that contributes to

658
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,960
that particular threat scenario and that

659
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,700
you can actually in the end use to to

660
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,340
calculate the overall risk

661
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,620
um but the the the part that you're

662
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,380
still missing today is effectively how

663
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,039
you can leverage controls

664
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,080
to reduce

665
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,320
not only the uh the the impacts of an

666
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,260
event but also the probability of a of a

667
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,460
particular event

668
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,720
and so you know before we we go into you

669
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,159
know going

670
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,980
to assess or to try to estimate the

671
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,360
actual

672
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,640
um the likelihood of of any of these

673
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,299
elements in in our specific uh scenario

674
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,679
um we're gonna need to take a look at

675
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,900
you know what controls can actually be

676
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,200
of use for this particular scenario

677
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,140
and so uh this is just one example uh by

678
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,820
the way Data Theft because it's the it's

679
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,620
the most common one

680
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,659
um there's other scenarios as well such

681
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,299
as uh you know account takeover or or

682
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,760
service disruption uh but obviously the

683
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,100
you know the methodology is the same

684
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,559
um you always make up you know what

685
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,679
elements you need to to to to contribute

686
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,720
to that particular Church scenario and

687
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,100
then you're going to look at the

688
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,860
controls that you need to effectively

689
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,719
um mitigate that particular risk

690
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,320
so

691
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,600
this is essentially where we uh where we

692
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
start talking about controls

693
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,039
um the controls are there to to to help

694
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,620
you mitigate risk to to you know uh

695
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,020
limit the probability or the chance of

696
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,240
something happening uh in the first

697
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,000
place but also to help you limit the uh

698
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,480
the potential impact so you know making

699
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,580
sure that if there's a data breach for

700
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,779
example

701
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,960
um that you can detect it early and

702
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,140
presents maybe many many records from

703
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,659
reaching out so if you keep it small the

704
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,460
ultimate cost will effectively also be

705
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,100
uh be reduced

706
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
now if you again look at the example of

707
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,559
uh of data theft

708
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,080
um then you know obviously you know

709
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,000
certain controls will come to mind uh

710
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,740
what I've done here is is I've actually

711
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,580
taken the um the nist tsf as a as a

712
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,260
framework here

713
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,820
um where we you know we look at these

714
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,919
five pillars these five stages identify

715
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,740
protect detect respond and recover and

716
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,020
so for each of these stages we're we're

717
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,679
going to list the type of outcome that

718
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,000
we want to have

719
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,799
um that will then help us you know

720
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,260
complete that threat scenario exercise

721
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,600
and so for example for identify you know

722
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,580
the questions to ask is do I have the

723
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,940
tools to perform uh uh an automated API

724
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,520
inventory and and make sure that you

725
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,220
know as part of that inventory I also uh

726
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,960
identified the data types that are

727
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,880
exposed to the API we're talking about

728
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,120
data uh theft here so we absolutely want

729
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,059
to know what apis could actually

730
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,159
you know contribute to the risk of data

731
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,279
being stolen for data being lost and as

732
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,140
part of the identification phase we also

733
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,640
want to look at the vulnerabilities that

734
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,620
it essentially could contribute to that

735
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,440
to that type of loss event

736
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,720
in the protect stage we uh we're

737
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,460
actually going to look at

738
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,980
um the the controls that you can use to

739
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,340
protect your apis to really prevent

740
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,220
attacks so here you need to take into

741
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,659
account you know

742
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,940
um what do we have in the in the OS top

743
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,340
10 in terms of you know critical

744
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,860
vulnerabilities or or vulnerabilities

745
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,039
that are most likely to be exported and

746
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,440
and how do I protect against that with

747
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,179
my current control set

748
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,320
okay

749
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,679
and then you have the the detect phase

750
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,360
um which is I would say equally

751
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,500
important

752
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,659
um and there we absolutely want to have

753
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,840
a capability that helps us identify a

754
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,460
data breach early

755
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,260
so

756
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,059
we want to make sure that whenever there

757
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,860
is a data breach and and specifically

758
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,480
for apis

759
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,179
um uh if there is an opportunity to to

760
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,899
to do detection and to interrupt the

761
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,659
leaking of data at an early stage so we

762
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,340
absolutely need a capability that helps

763
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,760
us identify data data breach the only

764
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,500
difficulty that will that you will face

765
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,260
here is that the the data breaches that

766
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,179
happen through apis they happen over a

767
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,360
longer period of time and in many cases

768
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,039
it will just look like regular traffic

769
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,039
so you need some type of capability here

770
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:24,240
that will allow you to identify let's

771
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,779
say the the anomalous behaviors uh from

772
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,940
the regular traffic

773
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,520
and if you then look at the the response

774
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,840
stage because you know once you've

775
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,960
detected that you need to have some

776
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,659
control or some possibility

777
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,340
um that will help you limit the the

778
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,140
magnitude of that loss event so

779
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,299
basically to interrupt data from leaking

780
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:46,260
out

781
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,640
um you need to have a mechanism that

782
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,320
allows you to do that

783
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,200
and finally in the recovery stage what

784
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,299
is really important there in order to

785
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,279
you know restore your business and

786
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,080
prevent such an event from happening

787
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,880
again because you need to have full

788
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,740
visibility into

789
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,100
um who was basically targeting you what

790
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,380
were they doing how are they doing it

791
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,779
um and uh you know at what time were you

792
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,340
doing it so you can actually reconstruct

793
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,100
the timeline of the event and you can

794
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,840
basically adapt your your defense

795
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,159
mechanisms

796
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,899
to make sure that this type of event

797
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,279
cannot happen again

798
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,559
so once you've asked yourself all these

799
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,399
questions and you you have an answer uh

800
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,039
to to to those questions in terms of you

801
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,380
know what controls you have you can then

802
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,140
complete the threat scenario exercise

803
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,360
um again for for for data theft in this

804
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,000
case and you know one way of doing it is

805
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,399
going over each of the elements

806
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,100
and indicating to you know to what

807
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,779
degree of of

808
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,559
um or to to to what degree of likeliness

809
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,100
that this particular element will be

810
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,279
let's say important to the overall uh

811
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,500
risk calculation or the overall threat

812
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,399
scenario

813
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,919
so I'll give the example here if um you

814
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,559
know you take the uh the point of a data

815
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,000
theft

816
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,919
um very likely that we're going to be

817
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,120
targeted by uh by cyber criminals and

818
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,120
um if they attack us from the outside uh

819
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,399
our public apis and potentially Shadow

820
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,840
apis uh might be in their focus okay so

821
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,640
very likely they will go for one of

822
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,659
those

823
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,940
if we then look at the at the

824
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,620
vulnerabilities

825
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,600
um you can then take into account what

826
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,159
controls you have that will actually

827
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,140
already you know prevent certain

828
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,140
vulnerabilities from being exploited for

829
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,760
example if you have a good

830
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,700
authentication control in place and you

831
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,799
can mark that one as green as it's you

832
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,580
know not likely to be an initial Target

833
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,140
same for example for injection attacks

834
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,840
if you have a web application firewall

835
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,640
and that that's been put in into

836
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,279
protection mode then you can have a

837
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,600
certain level of guarantee that

838
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,700
injection attacks will not will not work

839
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,740
will not succeed

840
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,019
um but for other types of

841
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,540
vulnerabilities or or attack techniques

842
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,339
you may not have a control or you you

843
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,500
may not know that you have that

844
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,960
particular vulnerability and and as an

845
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,159
example broken object level

846
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,260
authorization as I already mentioned is

847
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,060
the uh it's one of the most common

848
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,760
vulnerabilities being exploited it is

849
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,639
also very difficult to let's say protect

850
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,239
against it from a traditional point of

851
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,580
of view from a traditional signature

852
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,219
based approach you need other mechanisms

853
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,099
that will actually help you uh detect

854
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,020
such an attack

855
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,540
based on you know how your apis actually

856
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,980
work

857
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,020
so you know in this example you can say

858
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,119
oh we don't protect against uh against

859
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,560
Bola or we don't know how to protect

860
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,480
against dollars so that's you know going

861
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,540
to be a highly likely Target uh for

862
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,960
these uh attacks and then obviously as a

863
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,300
as a result you'll have a loss event uh

864
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,180
in this case again it's Data Theft

865
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,260
um

866
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,260
I put it as highly likely because we

867
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,880
have already a kind of a broad attack

868
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,320
surface

869
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,119
there is a good chance that this loss

870
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,800
event will happen and if it will happen

871
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,200
and we don't have the right controls to

872
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,839
detect and and mitigate it

873
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,420
um then obviously it will result in a

874
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,400
serious Financial cost

875
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,099
so that's how I typically go through uh

876
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,320
you know an exercise like this

877
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,240
um this helps you know customers

878
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,920
understand where their their

879
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,079
vulnerabilities are

880
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,820
um where their deficiencies may be in

881
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,640
terms of of controls and and also you

882
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,740
know where they may lack you know for

883
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,660
example the the knowledge about certain

884
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,160
vulnerabilities that they haven't

885
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,800
thought about and and maybe need to take

886
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,119
into account when they build their

887
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,940
roadmap for uh you know improving API

888
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,520
security

889
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,619
now that essentially brings us to uh

890
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,260
another set of uh of challenges and and

891
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,900
this is where again we see with a lot of

892
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,060
customers that that there is a let's say

893
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,099
a misconception about you know what

894
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,940
controls are actually useful to uh to to

895
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,280
to to you know protect your API

896
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,960
environment today

897
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,099
um and there's a few things that have

898
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,260
come out of the out of the reports that

899
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,140
we um uh that we coordinated with the

900
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,660
451 research group

901
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,040
um you know where you see that for

902
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,599
example if we focus on the secure

903
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,000
development of apis

904
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,040
um a lot of customers or you know a

905
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,960
third of the of the survey respondents

906
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
said that they had

907
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,240
um delays in in projects because of API

908
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,339
security concerns

909
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,140
um and it's it's basically a lack of

910
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,240
tools there that that would help them

911
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,880
deliver secure code into a production

912
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,440
environment

913
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,480
um that would you know give them a

914
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,220
guarantee that you know whatever they

915
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,960
push into production has been has been

916
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,180
methods have been validated through the

917
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,520
right set of checks and they don't have

918
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,980
the the right tools today to actually do

919
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,380
that so when they're about to release

920
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,900
something in production the infosec team

921
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,820
or the upsec team comes up and says well

922
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,960
you know if you don't if you haven't

923
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,300
done these in these checks then you know

924
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,579
we cannot authorize that that code to go

925
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,839
live

926
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,300
so the need there is is really to have

927
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,740
uh

928
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,560
security testing of apis being done in

929
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,640
advance

930
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,500
um and uh you know obviously that's

931
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,020
that's part of your secure coding uh

932
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,780
application development life cycle but

933
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,460
there needs to be collaboration between

934
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,099
the application and infosec teams on the

935
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,599
one hand side and application

936
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,700
development on the other side so you

937
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,040
cannot put the responsibility in you

938
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,200
know one group or another

939
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,480
um you need to basically you know Bridge

940
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,820
the silos together because otherwise

941
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,260
you're never going to have an effective

942
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,359
an effective process

943
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,480
to uh in the end deliver secure code

944
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,500
into your environment

945
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,240
a second type of

946
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,920
challenge that we see today with

947
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,839
customers is is around posture

948
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,540
management and this is you know really

949
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,060
important again for that risk assessment

950
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,880
exercise you need to have a good

951
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,880
inventory of your apis so you can

952
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,440
actually

953
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,320
use that inventory to to to to include

954
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,420
it in your risk assessment and you need

955
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,240
to very well understand what apis are

956
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,880
more critical in terms of certain loss

957
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,920
events if you take the example of data

958
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,500
theft you really need to understand how

959
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,079
data how you know sensitive data is

960
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,660
linked to the apis and how they are

961
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,200
exposing that data to the outside world

962
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,099
um

963
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,680
and then of course Beyond data your

964
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,480
inventory should should include other

965
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,700
characteristics as well that are

966
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,700
relevant to your risk assessments um for

967
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,920
example does an API have authentication

968
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,079
is that is that I think authentication

969
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,900
functioning properly for example

970
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,960
um is that API an internet facing API or

971
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,359
not and and how many

972
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,520
let's say consumers are are using the

973
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,740
API and are they you know for example

974
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,859
all using a cell or is the API exposed

975
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,240
through uh you know just regular HTTP

976
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,579
um so all these elements basically help

977
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,280
you

978
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,240
identify

979
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,940
how an API could potentially contribute

980
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,180
to a particular loss event and will help

981
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,640
you assess the uh the the risk that an

982
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,180
API brings to the organization

983
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,640
and then the last uh the last challenge

984
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,460
that we that we very frequently see is

985
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,619
is around what we call the runtime

986
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,200
security it's it's uh it's basically

987
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,660
protecting your apis from uh from

988
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,180
attacks and again here we see that

989
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,700
there's like a you know a misconception

990
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,579
of of what actual security controls can

991
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,619
bring to the table today

992
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,820
um again because of the lack of

993
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,040
awareness that I mentioned initially so

994
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,660
um there is that difference between the

995
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,000
uh the regular or wasp top 10 and the OS

996
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
API top 10 and if you look at you know

997
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,040
what's in that API top 10 and you then

998
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,839
start looking at all the different

999
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,880
controls that customers typically have

1000
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,859
then you can see that a lot of the

1001
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:14,700
Legacy controls are not well suited to

1002
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,820
deal with these uh with these uh let's

1003
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,740
say vulnerabilities or these attacks

1004
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,220
that are in the API of them

1005
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,140
so you know if you really want to tackle

1006
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,240
that problem again you need to go

1007
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,740
through that exercise that threat

1008
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,079
scenario exercises I said identify your

1009
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,599
lost events identify what could trigger

1010
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,760
these lost events and and how these

1011
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,339
vulnerabilities would would you know be

1012
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,040
leveraged uh in such a scenario

1013
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,440
um but then more importantly uh as I

1014
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,820
already mentioned if you want to have

1015
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,859
that that holistic approach to API

1016
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,380
security you must combine it with

1017
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,940
security testing

1018
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,800
on the one side to to remove

1019
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,540
vulnerabilities before they go into

1020
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,119
production but then on the other side on

1021
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,740
the defense side you also need to have

1022
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,540
that active monitoring detection and

1023
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,920
prevention

1024
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,579
um

1025
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,400
in production basically to deal with any

1026
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,339
any vulnerabilities that slip through or

1027
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,020
that might be

1028
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,579
um you know related to third-party

1029
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,380
development for example

1030
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,880
um and eventually ends up in production

1031
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,940
so in terms of recommendations if we uh

1032
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,180
if we now again look at our uh our

1033
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,260
missed uh CSF framework what is required

1034
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,720
for for each of these stages

1035
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,400
um this is a you know pretty

1036
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,440
comprehensive list of

1037
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,980
let's say outcomes that you must realize

1038
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,859
through your controls and so again if we

1039
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,720
took if we talk about you know the the

1040
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,839
identify stage it's important to really

1041
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:48,720
identify every API including you know

1042
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,300
all the data linked to the API including

1043
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,380
the misconfigurations and

1044
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,480
vulnerabilities and that will give you a

1045
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,140
good idea how to you know rate the

1046
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,060
probability of something happening of

1047
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,700
the probability of you know an API being

1048
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,380
breached

1049
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,079
obviously there's a protect side as well

1050
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,480
um so in protect you can basically use

1051
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,640
controls that will shield your apis from

1052
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,680
attacks

1053
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,960
um things like for example making sure

1054
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,460
that you have access control in place

1055
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,500
and only the right people can access an

1056
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,859
API making sure that all the uh you know

1057
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,960
Common threats and and then for example

1058
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,119
Bots are blocked and things like those

1059
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,220
attacks are being worked

1060
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,280
um now these things are actually

1061
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,619
let's say the the items that most

1062
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,099
customers already have or for the

1063
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,320
majority they will have controls that

1064
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,200
can can focus on these items and it's

1065
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,760
there that the misconception lies that

1066
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,040
you know if we if we have this in place

1067
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,260
then we are protected

1068
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,099
again here if you look at really the

1069
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,980
more advanced attacks you may see API

1070
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,859
attacks that look like genuine traffic

1071
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,839
where your your

1072
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,099
protect capabilities your protective

1073
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,859
controls will actually not bring a lot

1074
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,900
of value to the table and so that's

1075
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,700
where we move to uh detect and respond

1076
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,020
because for those type of attacks for

1077
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,400
the uh you know the more advanced

1078
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,980
attacks like you know attacks that that

1079
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,220
actually targets business logic flaws

1080
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,619
you need to have a mobile where you can

1081
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,839
actually look at transactions API

1082
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,359
transactions over a longer period of

1083
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,020
time and basically filter out the uh the

1084
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,780
anomalies that you see uh from the

1085
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,400
analysis that you're doing of all that

1086
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,960
of all that traffic

1087
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,880
and so this is really the you know the

1088
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,160
next the next level type of uh of

1089
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,380
detection that you will have

1090
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,119
um and you will also need to couple that

1091
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,640
with data exfiltration

1092
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,920
um Discovery or detection techniques

1093
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,500
because obviously if you uh if you are

1094
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,440
in your data Data Theft scenario

1095
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,960
um again the data will most likely be

1096
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,760
leaked out over a longer period of time

1097
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,460
a regular DLP solution may not be able

1098
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,440
to catch it because it looks like

1099
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,180
genuine traffic

1100
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,859
um and so you need a more advanced type

1101
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,839
of detection that is actually looking at

1102
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,960
API specific behaviors to be able to

1103
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,619
take that kind of that kind of activity

1104
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,319
what is an equally important uh once you

1105
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:20,160
are

1106
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,099
detecting something is that you can uh

1107
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,819
respond to the um the events that you

1108
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:27,720
detect

1109
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,940
um and so here if if you look at

1110
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,480
Solutions look at something that uh that

1111
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,240
can maybe on the one side do automated

1112
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,099
blocking

1113
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,200
um but on the other side that also

1114
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,119
integrates well with your existing

1115
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,480
incident response workflows so

1116
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
what we see with a lot of uh a lot of

1117
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,760
customers is that the you know the the

1118
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,920
stock teams that actually

1119
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,380
um man uh their their their incident

1120
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,000
response

1121
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,119
um they don't have proper insight into

1122
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,640
what is going on uh in the environment

1123
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,640
and that's not only true for for API

1124
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,740
specific environments it's it's you know

1125
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,680
a common pain in in security

1126
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,599
um is that the the quality of the

1127
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:15,240
information that ends up in the shop is

1128
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,880
is typically not of a very detailed

1129
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,339
level for them to really understand what

1130
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,380
is going on and and to really take the

1131
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,359
right action

1132
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,640
so really important for that response

1133
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,319
phase is that that they get the right

1134
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,880
information that they can take the right

1135
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,339
actions based on that right information

1136
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:34,260
and then finally if you go into the the

1137
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,700
big cover stage

1138
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,680
um there obviously you know you're

1139
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,900
trying to restore your environment

1140
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,280
um the first thing you probably want to

1141
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,920
do is if you have been reached to a

1142
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,960
particular vulnerability is make sure

1143
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,940
that that vulnerability is fixed and you

1144
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,579
deploy an unvulnerable API version

1145
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,800
um but then obviously also

1146
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,380
very important is that you learn from

1147
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,300
what has happened and and so that's why

1148
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,920
the you know the logging is really

1149
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,200
important that you can recreate that

1150
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,819
timeline you can recreate what happens

1151
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,859
and you can improve your policies and

1152
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,960
you can and your controls based on that

1153
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,720
and then ultimately if you are if you've

1154
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,240
been the victim of of uh you know an

1155
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,220
attacker that actually had a an impact

1156
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,800
on your data where your data was

1157
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,560
um maybe modified for example or a

1158
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,540
system was brought down is that you can

1159
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,099
actually restore those systems and the

1160
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,180
data

1161
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,579
um again you know very common uh to have

1162
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,640
that type of capability uh again not

1163
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,440
specific to API environments but it can

1164
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,359
happen in API environments as well

1165
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,200
so this kind of you know

1166
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,540
constitutes or or sums up the you know

1167
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,480
the recommendations that we have uh from

1168
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,579
from our side based on you know what we

1169
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,700
see in in real life uh when we talk to

1170
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,040
our customers and and basically what is

1171
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,599
also being confirmed in the research

1172
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:56,160
that we're doing

1173
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,740
um make sure you have a holistic

1174
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,020
approach that you know basically covers

1175
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,800
every aspect uh of API security and

1176
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,400
don't for example only focus on uh

1177
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,980
protects to you know

1178
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,260
to prevent attacks from happening

1179
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,599
and with that I would say thank you very

1180
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,540
much for uh for listening to this talk

1181
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,540
um I think we have about 10 11 minutes

1182
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,079
left for questions so if anybody has any

1183
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,599
questions I'm not sure if Christina

1184
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,960
yes yes team first

1185
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,960
yes first of all thank you so much for a

1186
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,180
great presentation and extremely

1187
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,900
interesting and important topic uh

1188
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,240
seeing or more than 60 percent of

1189
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,260
respondents having experienced the the

1190
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,480
bridge and

1191
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,040
the data leakage due to lacking API

1192
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,740
security is pretty pretty scary I need

1193
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,880
to say so it's uh it's very good to to

1194
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,520
bring awareness to to this and how we

1195
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,560
can improve the security of the apis

1196
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,160
so we have a few questions uh first one

1197
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,260
is what's a great way start learning API

1198
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,220
security with graphql and grpc coming in

1199
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,540
how this will change

1200
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,339
yeah that's a that's a very interesting

1201
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,540
question

1202
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,020
um we see that as well and it's a well

1203
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,420
without going into product specifics

1204
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,920
it's it's something that we are looking

1205
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,200
at uh actively

1206
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,960
um I would say they you know they will

1207
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,940
present new challenges they will bring

1208
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,099
new challenges to the table

1209
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,839
um we are looking into it from our

1210
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,420
perspective into how we can resolve it I

1211
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,940
would say the you know the the the

1212
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,119
the first step for everybody is just to

1213
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,640
understand again

1214
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,760
what's these new ways of you know uh

1215
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,220
creating apis or delivering apis is all

1216
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,280
about uh so you know educate yourself

1217
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,839
and then

1218
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,900
try to use that knowledge into assessing

1219
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,339
what you currently have in terms of

1220
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,400
protection and and and making sure that

1221
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,859
if you need new controls uh that is part

1222
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,578
of the conversation

1223
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:29,400
yes uh thank you and then another

1224
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,000
question is that you showed a really

1225
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,520
interesting threat scenario on the

1226
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,280
personal identifiable information Data

1227
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,640
Theft so how often would you recommend

1228
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,420
to execute threat modeling like this and

1229
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,760
are there any resources that can help

1230
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
you on the way uh that will make it

1231
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,740
easier to kind of perform such type of

1232
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,319
threat modeling and who should be a part

1233
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,540
of such an activity

1234
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,180
that's yeah very very interesting point

1235
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,400
uh you have there

1236
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,500
um I think threat modeling is definitely

1237
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,619
uh the the the good approach here

1238
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,680
um what my take on it would be is that

1239
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,839
you can you should do it as often as you

1240
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,579
can uh and obviously that's a challenge

1241
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,619
by itself because

1242
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,619
you know uh apis are being released at a

1243
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,440
very high rate and apis are changing all

1244
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,700
the time

1245
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,819
um but from uh let's say from a

1246
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,579
frequency perspective I think you can

1247
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:33,000
you can gain a lot by using tools that

1248
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,640
help you automate that exercise as well

1249
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,980
and and by automating I mean that you

1250
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,540
know do a lot of the work for you I

1251
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,220
think a lot of the

1252
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,740
you know holding being done today is

1253
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,380
based on knowledge that people have or

1254
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,300
knows that that people think they have

1255
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,819
about an environment and about trips and

1256
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,500
I think if you can if you can automate

1257
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,240
that process by

1258
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,819
I would say ingesting the right types of

1259
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,280
information about your environment

1260
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,440
then you can probably increase the

1261
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,960
frequency as well

1262
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,119
I hope that makes sense um it's it's

1263
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:08,460
something that we are you know

1264
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,819
definitely advocating for is that use

1265
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,819
use tools to do the you know the the

1266
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:17,940
dumb work let's say and and use tools to

1267
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,280
assess your environment as as often as

1268
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,260
possible in an automated way and then

1269
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,240
leverage that information to to update

1270
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,160
your track models based on you know what

1271
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,119
you're currently seeing in your

1272
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,460
environment

1273
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,440
would you recommend developers being

1274
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,559
part of this uh this activity the ones

1275
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,920
actually doing the development of apis

1276
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,380
to be part of the of the threat modeling

1277
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,359
activity yeah yeah in general yeah yeah

1278
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,119
of the threat modeling activity yeah

1279
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,800
absolutely absolutely

1280
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,059
um I think they can bring a lot of value

1281
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,040
to the table as well um because they

1282
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,339
know their code best and and they can

1283
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:54,780
probably give you

1284
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,540
know a good perspective on what are they

1285
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,400
looking at from a from a development

1286
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,260
perspective are they taking into account

1287
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,160
for example the the the specific API

1288
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,079
vulnerabilities

1289
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,900
um if if you start off from the from the

1290
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,900
wrong model you can easily develop an

1291
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,660
API that becomes very vulnerable and

1292
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,160
that should be taken into account when

1293
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,100
you do the threat modeling

1294
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,940
[Music]

1295
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,619
yeah

1296
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:26,460
um sounds really reasonable and while we

1297
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,079
are talking about developers right so

1298
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,079
you mentioned during your session that

1299
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,079
um sometimes or very often you have the

1300
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,619
Thai timelines and developers are really

1301
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:38,640
focused on kind of getting the

1302
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,339
functionality delivered and as soon as

1303
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,440
possible and before the deadline and

1304
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,380
then you may face these situations where

1305
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,660
for instance a security team or security

1306
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,700
Champions can say hey but this was not

1307
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,260
validated in this and this way and we uh

1308
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,900
we can't we can't allow it to be to be

1309
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,059
released and then the developers get

1310
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:01,920
really frustrated because they needed to

1311
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,599
get it out in production for the

1312
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,140
customers yesterday right so but so it's

1313
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,359
uh it is a challenge to make developers

1314
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,020
also be really

1315
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,520
conscious about security kind of

1316
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,800
understanding full understanding the

1317
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,900
focus of it so do you have any

1318
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,319
recommendations on how you can the break

1319
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,559
these silos how you can make developers

1320
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:27,839
as an as a security Champion for

1321
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,280
instance how you can make developers

1322
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,000
more conscious about about API uh

1323
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,460
security

1324
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,740
yes yes that's definitely one of the

1325
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,680
problems to uh to solve

1326
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,619
um I you know I think you put it rightly

1327
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:44,760
when you said there's there's there's

1328
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,480
probably too many silos uh in there

1329
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,140
um

1330
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,880
I think one of the things that we're

1331
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,980
seeing

1332
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,540
which customers you know one practice

1333
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,720
that is emerging is to create uh let's

1334
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,559
say API security program teams that that

1335
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,540
are jointly responsible for defining

1336
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,819
standards and architecture so

1337
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:08,099
um we see that we see that

1338
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:10,859
in in US organizations that are you know

1339
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:12,780
it's it's becoming a fairly established

1340
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,599
uh practice we also see that it's you

1341
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,839
know starting to happen in in emea as

1342
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,059
well but I think that's the first step

1343
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:24,559
right you want to involve everybody and

1344
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,780
the developers are part of the are part

1345
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,640
of the solution so they should be part

1346
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,160
of that API security program team that's

1347
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,559
that you know defines the standards

1348
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,500
around what API security means what uh

1349
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,660
what a secure architecture look like

1350
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,579
and then probably it will also be very

1351
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,900
will also be easier to

1352
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,420
let's say Define kpis around that or

1353
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,819
based on those standards and to achieve

1354
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,880
those kpis

1355
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,800
so collaboration is is definitely key

1356
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,599
here

1357
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,480
yeah and shift in left I guess to start

1358
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,359
to start to doing the security

1359
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:05,579
evaluation the evaluation of potential

1360
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:07,500
threads of these apis you are going to

1361
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,000
create before you actually start

1362
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,059
creating them it is also sounds like a

1363
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,859
good idea

1364
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,420
yeah absolutely

1365
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,819
um but when we talk about about uh

1366
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:20,640
shifting left it is it's on the one hand

1367
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,500
side making the Developers

1368
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,960
more aware of the security implications

1369
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,460
of the code they write

1370
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,960
um but it all starts with the right

1371
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,819
framework right and they also need to

1372
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:32,339
have the tools to you know to be able to

1373
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:35,099
validate their their applications or

1374
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,660
their apis against specific

1375
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,520
vulnerabilities

1376
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,040
um you know one of the things that that

1377
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,960
I mentioned quite often already is is

1378
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,720
that these authorization problems

1379
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,420
um that that is basically a result of

1380
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,980
the of the the wrong initial

1381
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,079
architecture and and sometimes

1382
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,880
developers are not aware of it right

1383
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,559
because they develop one piece of code

1384
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,720
into a broader

1385
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,200
um uh set of apis

1386
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,940
and so you need to have some testing

1387
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,740
tools at the end that can tell you

1388
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,319
whether or not you are vulnerable for

1389
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:09,180
these um you know for these specific

1390
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,660
exports uh against your apis

1391
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,160
hmm

1392
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,180
yeah absolutely and then I think we have

1393
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,980
time for one last question that just

1394
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,559
popped up uh the question was about any

1395
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,339
tools about any tool recommendations you

1396
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:28,260
have which we

1397
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,700
are talking about here

1398
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,000
um that's uh

1399
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,680
a fair question I would say and I I

1400
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,380
cannot speak for uh for the tools that

1401
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,819
we offer of course

1402
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:43,740
um

1403
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,760
yeah I I guess it's a bit of a tough

1404
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,760
tough question to ask in this case

1405
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,780
um

1406
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,940
yeah

1407
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,059
based the tools that you that you use on

1408
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:59,280
the on the risk assessment exercise that

1409
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,599
you're doing and on the vulnerabilities

1410
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:03,119
that you're trying to detect

1411
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,000
um because you have tools like uh you

1412
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,280
know the the substance dust tools um

1413
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,140
they all have their use they will all

1414
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,720
target certain vulnerabilities uh

1415
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,119
but in the end it comes down to you know

1416
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,119
which ones are really important for me

1417
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:20,760
and for my organization

1418
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,079
uh

1419
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,180
uh again depends on the risks that

1420
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,980
you're trying to uh that you're trying

1421
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,839
to mitigate front

1422
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,760
absolutely

1423
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,220
yeah

1424
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,460
uh yes but uh thanks uh thanks a lot Tim

1425
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,140
I think we've been through all the

1426
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,839
questions and we just have a minute or

1427
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,760
so left so I would like to thank you

1428
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,040
once again for a really interesting

1429
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,220
session and thanks to all of the

1430
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,960
participants who have joined this

1431
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,099
session with us today
