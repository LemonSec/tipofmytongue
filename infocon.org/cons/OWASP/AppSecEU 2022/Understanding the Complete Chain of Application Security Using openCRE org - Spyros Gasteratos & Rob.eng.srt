1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,319
hello and welcome everybody

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,500
in the last session of today in the

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,599
Builder strike my name is Tatiana

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,280
bellandier and I'm a principal security

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
architect at Diamond track and today I

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,320
will be moderating the session

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,939
in the next 40 45 minutes uh Rob Van de

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,599
VR and Spiros castavatros will present

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,060
the understanding the complete chain of

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,200
application security using openseery.org

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,640
um after that we'll have time for

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,500
questions

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,899
please put your questions in the Q a

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,680
panel on the right of the streaming in

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,920
the Hoover app please note that the chat

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,520
function in Zoom is deactivated but in

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
these you can use the chat

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,800
function in the app

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,420
without

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,780
further explanation I would hand over to

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,180
Robin Spurs to start and present

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,299
themselves thank you very much

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,520
thank you very much Tatiana hello

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,520
everybody and welcome wherever you are

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,780
in this world

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,540
also on behalf of Spiros my co-speaker

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,180
we're really excited to take you through

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,540
what open Siri is exactly and how it can

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,560
help you

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,780
in a nutshell for those this have that

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,659
haven't seen open Siri yet it's

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,360
basically a gigantic index for security

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,479
requirements across major standards it

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,000
links the content of these standards so

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,460
when you're checking a thing with asbs

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,220
for example you can learn more about how

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,700
to test it and how to use tools to test

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,640
it and how to code solutions for it and

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,140
you can learn more about the related

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,420
threats and read what nist has to say

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,780
about it it brings all this information

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,060
together around a certain topic that you

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,340
are working on or interested in

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,299
so that's open Theory really short let's

45
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,840
dive into the full story but maybe

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,280
first a short introduction

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,140
I work for a software Improvement group

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,020
Rob Thomasville is my name I specialize

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,080
in security privacy and Ai and I take

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,540
part in all kinds of standardization

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,860
initiatives

52
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,959
national standards European standards

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,900
with the Nissa Global standards with ISO

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,940
IEC and I contribute to OS Sun

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,520
Spiros how about you

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,520
hi everybody my name is Peter casteratos

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,459
I work as an application security lead

58
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,980
at the fintech company based out of

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,620
London called Thought Machine I call

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,300
lead Theo wasp integration standards

61
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,879
project so please opencry.org initiative

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
and in my free time I like to be an open

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,220
source developer and I was volunteer

64
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,580
I've donated code to a bunch of projects

65
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,940
including dracon SKF and others

66
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,099
thanks very much

67
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,500
so we both lead the integration

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,680
standards project and we're supported by

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,440
another co-lead which is Ali sad

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,959
and the assignment of our project is to

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,239
bring our standards and Beyond more

72
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,819
together and for that purpose we have

73
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,200
created

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,959
two main things first the security

75
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,260
wayfinder that I'll show you in a moment

76
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,200
and also the topic of today open Theory

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,860
as a linking platform for oasp and to

78
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,420
the rest of the world of security

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,860
resources

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,459
and cre stands for common requirement

81
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,420
enumeration

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,659
as said we build the security wayfinder

83
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,319
it's an interactive map of Key owasp

84
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,080
projects grouped by the activities in

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,299
the software development life cycle

86
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,400
so depending of what you're doing what

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,560
you're interested in you can find

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
resources at OAS that matter and

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,360
easily see what they are for it helps

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,680
people to get to the right information

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,380
when they are not so familiar with owas

92
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,540
or when they are familiar with OS

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,560
because

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,600
I've been around with OS for a while and

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,820
so was Spiros and we're still sometimes

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,860
confused where where we can find things

97
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,220
and this is really helpful uh it's all

98
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,380
based on an idea that started about six

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,940
years ago when I was working together

100
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,160
with Martin knobloch

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,680
who you probably know when we both felt

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,840
it was kind of hard to make sense of all

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,180
the things taking place at oasp

104
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,040
so after we built this in our project

105
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,479
and we started working on open cre

106
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,520
um and let us start the story of open

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,479
cre at the why

108
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,300
why I think we create open Siri

109
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,060
it's because the world is having a big

110
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,979
problem today when it comes to finding

111
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,560
relevant information on application

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,699
security

113
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,340
it's a struggle and I'm sure you

114
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,960
recognize this

115
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,479
the available information is bulky

116
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
fragmented complex confusing

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,300
take a look for example at this report

118
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,759
that I show here in the slide

119
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,960
it's a report by the European sub

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,060
security organization

121
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,000
and it's just a list of existing

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,419
security standards uh it's more than 200

123
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,280
pages I think that's a good illustration

124
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,220
of the situation and this is the case

125
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,100
not because it's necessary to have a lot

126
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,039
of standards and complexity

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,440
uh it's not required at all but there

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,479
are historic reasons psychological

129
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,060
reasons political and Commercial reasons

130
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,360
that we have to deal with this today

131
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,639
so if you're an engineer a tester a

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,740
security officer if you want to buy

133
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,320
software and set requirements it's hard

134
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,360
to select and find appropriate

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,699
information on security to do your work

136
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,580
and if your writing is standard it's

137
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,500
hard to refer your readers to other

138
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,560
sources because it's a bit of a mess

139
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,080
there are many many standards and for

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
most part they talk about the same

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,020
things

142
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,360
and this is also the conclusion from an

143
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,020
Anisa report on software security and

144
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,699
one of the recommendations of this

145
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,880
report is to develop a common repository

146
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,240
for requirements this is exactly what we

147
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,660
did in our integration standards project

148
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,240
and it's been my personal quest for

149
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,160
about seven years now to to make a

150
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,500
difference for this situation to uh to

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,199
improve and the theory is is a key

152
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,759
Initiative for it

153
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,060
so let's start with an example of this

154
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,560
struggle

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,500
um let's take the use case of your

156
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,319
writing is standard you're an author

157
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,139
um how difficult is it to link to

158
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,180
related work in an effective way and

159
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,280
keep it up to date

160
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,139
let's have a look

161
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,780
so say you're writing a document for a

162
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,960
National Standard for some industry it

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,780
can also be a company Wiki where you're

164
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,039
writing a a policy or more explanation

165
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,639
for your developers or your testers

166
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,259
and you're currently dealing with a

167
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,180
chapter on secret management

168
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,940
you write something down you want to

169
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,639
refer your readers to more information

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,960
because you don't want to cover

171
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,720
everything about Secrets yourself you

172
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,220
don't have all the knowledge and you

173
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,620
can't keep up to date what you write so

174
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,740
it's smart to refer so you add

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,900
references and we see this a lot right

176
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,120
in security resources and it's it's a

177
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
good thing because you don't want to

178
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,060
write everything yourself you want to

179
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,960
point people to other standards

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,979
um

181
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,639
however this has several issues and I'm

182
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,340
sure you must have experienced all of

183
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,139
them or some of them

184
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,319
first of all such a list lacks structure

185
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,500
it's just a flat list it's not clear uh

186
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,900
why

187
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,819
cwe123 or

188
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,919
cwe456 is in this

189
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,840
list

190
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,680
um second links get outdated all the

191
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,620
time I I know many current security

192
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,720
standards which half of the links are

193
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,539
not working anymore

194
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,059
standards change the structure sometimes

195
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,279
their location and then you get an error

196
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,419
message

197
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,299
or you get linked to an old version

198
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,640
while there is a newer version on

199
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,559
another location it's quite hard to keep

200
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,300
it up to date

201
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,200
and also there may be some really good

202
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,300
resources that the author doesn't know

203
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,779
of or chooses not to include because it

204
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,180
is limited to some scope for example

205
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,380
just for AWS or just for Java and the

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,760
author doesn't want to create and

207
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,459
maintain a very long list so these lists

208
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,440
are rather are hardly ever complete

209
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,959
foreign

210
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,040
so either you get a list of references

211
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,279
that is flawed or what often happens is

212
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,600
that authors

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,120
think I really want to help my readers

214
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,000
and I took a look at those links and I

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,399
think I can summarize what's written in

216
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,480
them so the standard becomes bigger

217
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
because the author decides to cover the

218
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,459
preferred information themselves

219
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,880
oh dear yes the reference problem is

220
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
solved but this typically results in

221
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,100
inconsistencies and incompleteness

222
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,560
because it's not the author's expertise

223
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
per se

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,860
and the information that's written down

225
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,140
that's a certain moment in time it's not

226
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,600
updated automatically

227
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,260
in that sense it's better to refer

228
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,380
um and this this phenomenon is very

229
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,800
understandable and it's also one of the

230
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,839
classes for the bulkiness the

231
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,580
fragmentation and the quality issues

232
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,399
that standards face today

233
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
if only those references would be more

234
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,279
complete have structure and stay up to

235
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,700
date automatically if only well that's

236
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,519
what opensory is for that's the whole

237
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,440
idea

238
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,019
how does open series solve these

239
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,360
problems how can you use it

240
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,060
let's look at an example so in the top

241
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,519
left you see the documentation of the

242
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,279
wrong Secrets projects which is great

243
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,500
tool great resource by jerun Williams

244
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,440
and and others it's about secret

245
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,540
management

246
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,180
well in this documentation they want to

247
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,560
point their readers to more information

248
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
on the subject typically you go through

249
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,899
what I just showed you and make a list

250
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,579
of all these resources that are related

251
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,279
but the idea is that instead of having

252
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,579
all these links you have one link you

253
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,880
have a link to the open series you

254
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,380
simply link to

255
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,920
the openc read page on storing Secrets

256
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
which is a common requirement

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,839
and that page

258
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,000
helps you to find everything you need

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,640
and everything will be up to date how we

260
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,940
do that I'll explain later but what you

261
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,720
see from the page is a link to what nist

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
writes about cryptographic key

263
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,200
establishment you will see the OS cheat

264
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,899
sheet on Secrets management you will see

265
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,380
links to asvs the top 10 the capex

266
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,459
threads weaknesses from miter proactive

267
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,519
controls another great OS Project zap

268
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,360
rules which are rules of dynamic testing

269
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,839
tool that can detect weaknesses and you

270
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,019
learn how you can use these rules to

271
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,519
find weaknesses related to secret

272
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,820
storage in this case everything is nice

273
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,920
and connected

274
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,360
and if you want you as a user of opencre

275
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,620
you can explore related topics because

276
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,620
secret storage also links to other

277
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,339
common requirements that are related

278
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,519
so you can jump to there for example the

279
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,440
common requirement of storing Keys

280
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,019
safely and find everything that has to

281
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,480
do with that certain topic

282
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,660
and also this whole ecosystem features

283
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,560
backlinks so not just links from one to

284
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,820
the other side but also links back

285
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,920
um for example if somebody's reading the

286
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,899
cheat sheet secret management

287
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,620
and they follow the link to open cre

288
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,839
they may be very well interested in the

289
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,880
wrong Secrets project right that way

290
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,860
everything is connected and you can find

291
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,339
all relevant resources from all relevant

292
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,079
resources

293
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,139
so there you have it open Siri and we

294
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,540
build it it's operational it's in better

295
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,000
right now it's open source

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
it works

297
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,500
but to make it work we first had to

298
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,579
overcome a number of hardships I have to

299
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,459
say and we needed to battle a couple of

300
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,899
demons

301
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,480
uh let me take you along our Odyssey of

302
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,180
the last oh Spiros I think two and a

303
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,320
half years

304
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,480
it's uh it's been a ride

305
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,180
we first started mapping everything to

306
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,519
everything now you see here four

307
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,160
standards but to the point in time we

308
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,139
have we had a lot more

309
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,540
so if you have for example 10 standards

310
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,360
you need to manually link each section

311
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,180
of each standard to the corresponding

312
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,700
section in each of the other standards

313
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,339
this is an exponential problem so it

314
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,660
takes a lot of time

315
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,519
and when you're finally done it will

316
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,220
already be outdated so if you want to

317
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,500
map everything to everything it's too

318
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,959
much work and you can't keep up and all

319
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,300
over the Internet there are great

320
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,940
Endeavors of people trying this uh but

321
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,420
it's it's it's very hard to make this

322
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,700
future proof

323
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,060
so what did we do we sold this by

324
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,579
introducing common requirements these

325
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,279
are General Security topics and the

326
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,920
standards can link to those instead of

327
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,639
to each other so if two sections

328
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,399
link to the same topic

329
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,860
they also link to each other because

330
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,779
they just specified that they are

331
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,519
related

332
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,459
to zoom into this a little bit more

333
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,300
um let's say we're talking about session

334
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,920
token generation nist has a nice piece

335
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,339
on uh random number generation the

336
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,880
testing guide talks about how to test it

337
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,820
kpeck describes the threat involved

338
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,480
mobile asvs talks also about session

339
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,220
token generation

340
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,680
what you do is from this mobile asvs

341
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
section you link to session token common

342
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,660
requirements that's the only thing you

343
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,360
need to do and all the other resources

344
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,339
that also link to this common

345
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,440
requirement

346
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,420
you get within which you're linked with

347
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,000
those as well if you maintain the links

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,160
with the common requirements

349
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,720
it works

350
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,959
so you only have to create the link to

351
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,240
the topic not the link to each of every

352
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,459
subsection of each and every other

353
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,600
standard

354
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,899
so we solve this problem

355
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,019
but we created a new one because we

356
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,180
created all those topics but we ran into

357
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,120
another problem there are

358
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,940
many many topics

359
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,680
very detailed ones also

360
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,019
so if you're writing a standard on

361
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,420
storing secrets you would have to go

362
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,360
through all the topics at open Theory

363
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,760
and find everything related to secret

364
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,740
management

365
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,760
um

366
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,519
it's hard it's a lot of work it's Error

367
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,720
Chrome

368
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,940
but what we did instead of just having

369
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,940
these detailed topics on these detailed

370
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,680
technical level

371
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,980
we introduced higher level topics

372
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,320
for example input validation or

373
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,260
authentication on multiple levels here

374
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,779
you see just a few of them but we

375
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:37,680
created

376
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,759
a semantic web if you will of of things

377
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,779
that matter in application security

378
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,420
so if you're writing a piece on storing

379
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,899
secrets you just have to link to the

380
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,000
topic of secret storage and then you're

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,220
done because from there you can move to

382
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,459
everything that is related

383
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,040
and because we built this semantic web

384
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,699
of security topic

385
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,839
we introduced a nice bonus because users

386
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,579
can follow the links between the topics

387
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,859
to navigate and to explore information

388
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,640
up to three and down the tree and we

389
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,500
built this web by doing a lot of

390
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,020
research having a lot of workshops by

391
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,240
using existing works on harmonizing

392
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,880
standards for example the security model

393
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,460
by software Improvement group that they

394
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,320
donated to be used as input to the

395
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,039
framework and this

396
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:38,100
semantic web uh works like

397
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,559
this

398
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,200
um you see here different topics

399
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,660
Within opensory

400
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,100
that we also call the common

401
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,539
requirements

402
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,940
and linked with them are several

403
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,000
standards I just picked picked out a few

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,860
just to illustrate there are much more

405
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,840
standards linked but let's start with

406
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,320
this detailed topic encrypting personal

407
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,360
data address

408
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,539
it has an asvs entry that talks more

409
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,580
about checking this

410
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,280
it has a link to another topic personal

411
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,860
data handling

412
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,679
which is linked again to some nice nice

413
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,240
nist documents on personal data and how

414
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,580
to deal with it

415
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,679
through securely storing regulated data

416
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,140
you get to encrypting data at rest

417
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,679
and you see connected weaknesses and you

418
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,840
arrive at cryptography

419
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,500
about which nist also has written a

420
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,260
couple of nice chapters as part of uh SP

421
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,640
853 in this case

422
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
so everything is connected and when you

423
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
look at the topic page of encrypting

424
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,740
personal data at rest you will see all

425
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
this

426
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,100
information because it's directly

427
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,460
related and it's indirectly related and

428
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,039
also you will see the topics in between

429
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,440
so we'll not be a long list of

430
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,039
references it will be clear to you why

431
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,559
there's this chapter from this because

432
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
it's about cryptography and why there's

433
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,700
this chapter from this because it's

434
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,520
about personal data handling

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,559
this is why the topic structure is

436
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,720
helpful for exploration for

437
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,080
visualization and for making the the

438
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,980
linking feasible

439
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,820
um we ran into another problem of course

440
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,160
after linking to a standard the standard

441
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,140
changes structure and the links were

442
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,400
broken

443
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,620
it became clear to us that you can't

444
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,039
keep up with these links not if you have

445
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,559
the ambition to work with so many

446
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,780
standards but even if you have the

447
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,280
ambition to work with four standards

448
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,220
it's a lot of work to keep it up to date

449
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,240
standards constantly change and

450
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,419
rightfully so so links break at some

451
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,980
point

452
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,940
okay

453
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,679
and

454
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,559
we found a solution for this and by

455
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,440
doing so we made open Theory self

456
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,059
maintaining

457
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,179
if a standard contains a link let's say

458
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,580
it is mobile ACS entry here and it has

459
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,419
this link to this uh common requirement

460
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,200
at open Siri as you may notice they are

461
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,140
identified by six digits separated by

462
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,360
Dash

463
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,080
and

464
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,039
um

465
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,740
if the standard contains this link

466
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,200
and it's in machine readable source

467
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,500
which it mostly is an mnd file or a text

468
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,660
file

469
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,880
our parsers can scan that standard and

470
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,120
when it finds the link it sees okay this

471
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,880
is a section of this standard with this

472
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,000
name with this number and it links to

473
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
this topic

474
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,799
so by parsing the source that just has

475
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,419
the link you have all the information

476
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,160
for the mapping there

477
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,320
so the mapping is not maintained in some

478
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,600
separate text file table or sheet it is

479
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,700
maintained in the standard itself and

480
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,100
automatically moves around with the

481
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,500
standard the editor sees the link and

482
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,240
when it takes out that section and puts

483
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,280
it in another chapter or whatever the

484
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,580
links move with it and therefore will

485
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,720
stay up to date after the next parse

486
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,120
obviously this requires the standard to

487
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,840
add links to open Siri in their material

488
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,280
and for standards that don't have this

489
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
you need a mapping file for which we

490
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,280
have a certain format and we put that

491
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
mapping file those mapping files on

492
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,799
GitHub to which people can contribute

493
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,260
that's the whole idea

494
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,880
yeah

495
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,159
so by solving these problems we were

496
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,580
able to create open Theory and the beta

497
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,159
went live last September at the 20th

498
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,159
anniversary of owasp we did this with a

499
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,320
lot of help with special kudos to the

500
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,159
SKF team ossf input from the OS top 10

501
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,240
team many people were involved and we

502
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,900
now currently map asvs top 10

503
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,880
nist 63b missed 53 those are the SP 800

504
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,900
series

505
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,200
proactive controls or cheat sheets or

506
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,880
testing guides miters cwe

507
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
zap the rules from zapper also included

508
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,679
and kpec describing the threats that are

509
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:29,880
involved

510
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,600
and I would say that now would be

511
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,780
probably a good time to do demo so I'd

512
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,720
like to ask Spiros to take over and

513
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,320
share your screen

514
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,360
and if I'm right you can overrule my

515
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,720
sharing otherwise I'll stop sharing

516
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,179
foreign

517
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,179
mute

518
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,220
you're still on mute

519
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,880
no you're not a mute I can't hear you

520
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
ah technology

521
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,380
can you hear me now

522
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,080
yes

523
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
so

524
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,500
sometimes technology needs a kicking

525
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,400
uh let me share my screen

526
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,320
so that you can see what I am seeing

527
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,440
so for demo we will have prepared a

528
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,740
couple of very useful use cases at least

529
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,740
useful to us how we've used us we'll use

530
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,600
them in their day our day-to-day

531
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,299
and we believe they're gonna be useful

532
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,240
to you as well

533
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,960
it's shared a part of the screen

534
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,980
can you see my screen

535
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,600
perfect

536
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,240
so use case number one is

537
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,340
I'm an upsec engineer

538
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,080
I believe some of you in the audience

539
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,480
are also optic Engineers or devsecopes

540
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,760
or however we call running tools

541
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,280
scanning code and Advising on security

542
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,220
these days so we have here a report from

543
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,159
a very popular

544
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,480
scanning tool called owaspa zap and

545
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,480
reports

546
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,460
um

547
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,419
contain alerts an example alerta I put

548
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,900
in here is ldap injection and

549
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,020
for every alert is up and every tool out

550
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,940
there needs to provide you some

551
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,919
references because

552
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,679
if they don't they end up in this

553
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
position that Rob mentioned where you

554
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,780
have to just copy paste text from all

555
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,840
over the place which will quickly become

556
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,700
unwieldy however

557
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,780
you also have very limited space for

558
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,400
references you cannot add all the

559
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,039
references you cannot

560
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,460
also maintain a huge list of references

561
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,080
zap itself has four three references

562
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,418
plus one I added for crd and

563
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,380
it's already kind of a long report so

564
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,600
on the other hand what they can do and

565
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,480
they will soon be doing uh PR incoming

566
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,740
is linked to opencry.org

567
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,919
if I click this link it takes you to

568
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,559
opencre.org the specific cre that

569
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,740
describes ldap injection and how to

570
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,799
protect it against it

571
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,000
with as

572
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,820
an application security professional

573
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,940
once I have this information I can

574
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,419
easily disseminate

575
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,179
specific standards and specific links to

576
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,200
specific teams or stakeholders so that I

577
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
don't need to rewrite it myself so I

578
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,120
save myself time and I can't be lazy and

579
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,299
so that we all know what we're talking

580
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,860
about and

581
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,580
as the last uh like as a last point

582
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,700
different levels and different positions

583
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,440
and stakeholders need different kinds of

584
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,260
information so in this case

585
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,419
I can send

586
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,820
my Auditors a link to asbs I can send

587
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,039
Architects or other people uh link to

588
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,960
practice controls I can tell my boss

589
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,740
that we have a vulnerability related to

590
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,240
cwv19

591
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,419
and I can send the developers who found

592
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,539
it who are the custodias of that

593
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,179
specific piece of code a link to those

594
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,620
seat seats on how to fix it so for SBS

595
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,960
one click and

596
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,100
you get exactly what controls are broken

597
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,220
for proactive controls another click and

598
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,440
you get exactly what other proactive

599
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,020
controls uh you need to

600
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,159
do

601
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,440
cwv similar

602
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,460
you have all the cwp information

603
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,679
and teach it I think you know the drill

604
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,700
so far you get exactly how to fix it

605
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,340
specific special characters you need to

606
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,480
escape and several cheats also include

607
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,320
small pieces of information or code so

608
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,840
that you don't have to

609
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,760
um yeah so that you don't have to do

610
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,659
anything

611
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,360
and all of these because we created a

612
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,919
web application and web applications

613
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,360
contained

614
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,860
apis uh can be done via our API so you

615
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,679
don't even need to visit a website you

616
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,880
can include this into your own

617
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,000
Automation and

618
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,480
this way because we know about the zap

619
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,120
specific rule you can query our API for

620
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,760
that rule find out

621
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,240
get the Json find out the links the

622
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,960
document and then you have the CRA I

623
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,440
showed on the first slide and then

624
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,080
you can manipulate the cre to extract

625
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,059
all the relevant information

626
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,200
but

627
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,820
so

628
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,460
by doing all of that

629
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,460
you have easy and immediate

630
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,700
dissemination of information to all

631
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,460
relevant stakeholders without

632
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,020
any

633
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,360
um without much effort from your site

634
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,400
you don't need to rewrite or copy paste

635
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,460
your mediation advice from any Wiki it's

636
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,140
all easy

637
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,000
however

638
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,620
what happens

639
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,140
if you have an internal security

640
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,100
standard as well many places do I know

641
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,620
the place I work and the our customers

642
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,039
do as well well in that case you can use

643
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,380
CRA as well and you can import your

644
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,860
standard into CRA and it's very easy

645
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,380
I took the liberty of creating enactment

646
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,900
security standard uh for you for those

647
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,700
of you who have ever watched Looney

648
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,580
Tunes accommends the company provides

649
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,299
coyote with all sorts of cartoonist

650
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,480
weapons and

651
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,020
the Acme security standard has

652
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,159
if you close this uh that somehow map

653
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,419
either to asvs or even easier to cre

654
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,399
w

655
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,740
you don't have to map it to both you can

656
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,740
just map it to anything we already know

657
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,860
about and then we will

658
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,539
do this uh like jump moppings for you

659
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,120
and as you see this is

660
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,659
quite an easy templated spreadsheet we

661
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,840
for now we only support Google sits but

662
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,179
if we see that there is any need for

663
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,140
other Technologies uh for importing we

664
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,120
can also figure this out and the way to

665
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,760
make to import these

666
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,980
for now it's terminal soon it will be

667
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,320
web application and you just write

668
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,960
crd.pi add from spreadsheet and then a

669
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,299
link to the spreadsheet and if I press

670
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,320
enter

671
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,779
and the demo Gods agree with me today

672
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,820
these will be imported

673
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,179
perfect it complaints about kpec but

674
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,600
that is information it's fine

675
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,980
and

676
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,140
now

677
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,320
I can go to my local version and

678
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,360
I can load my local version of Siri

679
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,940
type the name of my company or anything

680
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,179
related to the standards I'm looking for

681
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,799
and as you see

682
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,100
my controls are already there

683
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,559
and if I open a random one say

684
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,840
authorized access I links to the hvs you

685
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,520
it was linked to

686
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,860
and if I

687
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,740
and as you see they are all linked to

688
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,340
the asvs that they were linked to

689
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,899
and

690
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:35,279
this one because it the specific crd had

691
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,159
other links also links to zap cities

692
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,460
testing guide cwe and if I scroll the

693
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,279
way down here it also links to nist so

694
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,380
you as an auditor or um a security

695
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,840
professional wrote a short spreadsheet

696
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,299
which is one mapping and you get

697
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,120
every other mapping we have and we know

698
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,960
about

699
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
for free

700
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,640
I think that allows quite a lot of

701
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,600
flexibility and quite a lot of

702
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
saving of time

703
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,100
Rob back to you

704
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,360
thanks beerus

705
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,260
so after this

706
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,760
demo

707
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,380
I'd like to do a short recap of why

708
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,659
we're doing this because it's it's very

709
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,179
important to get this across

710
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,760
the theory

711
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,919
enables alignment and cross-reference

712
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,100
between security material material and

713
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,980
by doing so it becomes easier for

714
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,659
standard makers

715
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,000
and it's easier for people who work with

716
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,340
security to find and use relevant

717
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,820
information and there are two important

718
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,279
bonuses

719
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,659
first of all

720
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,600
the common requirements they help lead

721
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,299
to a shared understanding on what

722
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,899
security needs it helps to speak the

723
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,299
same language so to say it will be

724
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,000
easier for people in procurement to

725
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,419
mention a certain requirement and

726
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,279
people at the other side of the table

727
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,860
will recognize that requirement because

728
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,100
it's a topic that on which there is

729
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,440
consensus in which everything is bound

730
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,059
together

731
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,419
it also leads to more consistency and

732
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,820
and less gaps between standards because

733
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,059
there's less duplication and less uh

734
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,760
proliferation so link all the things

735
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,960
with open Theory

736
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,000
final slide

737
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,919
a call to action

738
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,679
we will continue to work with standard

739
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,919
makers to further adopt hope and Siri

740
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:57,480
and we're constantly adding new

741
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,700
standards and new features

742
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,279
something that we recently built is that

743
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,820
you can use open Siri to deep link to a

744
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,879
certain resource so people won't see

745
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,879
open series user interface when they

746
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,000
when you use this URL but the series

747
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,739
system will make sure that the right

748
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,780
section of the right version of for

749
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,418
example the asvs will be shown

750
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,820
so this way you can have maintainable

751
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,418
links to a specific resource

752
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,040
linked from your work

753
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,040
and also using the same idea you can use

754
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,719
the URL to specify how you want the

755
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,020
refer the information to be displayed

756
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,719
perhaps only or wasp resources or

757
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,359
perhaps resources only about processes

758
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,619
or only about software development

759
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,560
in the references in the URL you can

760
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,280
specify the scope of things to be to be

761
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,380
shown

762
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,660
another cool version is personal

763
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,780
profiles the idea is and we're working

764
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,140
on that you can specify what you find

765
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,540
interesting at open Siri and what

766
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,940
resources you prefer or which ones you

767
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,200
don't want to see

768
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,720
so whenever you click on a reference

769
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,839
link anywhere you will only see links to

770
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,300
the resources that matter the most

771
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,780
to you so our idea is there's a lot out

772
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,680
there let's enable people to find this

773
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,460
lot but provide everything that we can

774
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,619
to tailor to actually create an

775
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,380
information field depending on the

776
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,660
person that's using it and that allows

777
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,359
you that from your work you can point to

778
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,720
all those topics and the end user will

779
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,300
be in control of what is interesting and

780
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,420
what is not because everybody has his or

781
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,160
her own scope and interest

782
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,380
um another cool idea is that we're

783
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,839
working on is to have Federated search

784
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,680
the ability to enter a search term and

785
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,040
look through all the material that is

786
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,060
being linked to you can now search

787
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,800
at the open series website you can

788
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,359
search in the descriptions of the

789
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,280
requirements it's quite useful if you

790
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,500
search for a session for example you

791
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,020
will find everything about sessions but

792
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,359
currently you cannot search into the

793
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,420
actual detailed content because it's not

794
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,060
part of our database but because we

795
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,480
parse the machine readable sources of

796
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,680
standards

797
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,560
we can also create an index and then

798
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,500
provide you with text search on all the

799
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,200
content of the standards and integrate

800
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,780
that into open Siri

801
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,000
that's what we're working on what can

802
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
you do well you will be seeing an open

803
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,160
series more and more as part of tools

804
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,920
and standard documents to point you in

805
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,500
the right direction but you can also use

806
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,540
it you can go to the website to look up

807
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,000
things and learn more about a certain

808
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,480
topic and I invite you we invite you to

809
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,339
do that and

810
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,099
preferably let other people know about

811
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,579
it tweet about it Link in about it

812
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,740
whatever make nice selfies with open

813
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,099
Siri whatever you can do to help us

814
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,839
spread the word that this thing is out

815
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,800
there

816
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,079
provide your feedback and ideas very

817
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,880
important for us we have a GitHub

818
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,200
project for it

819
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,420
it's linked here you can join our

820
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,640
mailing list and you can join our team

821
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,960
to help grow open Siri further and above

822
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,140
all a call to all standard makers and

823
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,740
the call is let's unite start adding

824
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,680
Siri links to your work and ask us to

825
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,560
parse it and then you're done it saves

826
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,359
you time on finding references and

827
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,839
keeping them up to date

828
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,640
links will never break your standard

829
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,859
becomes instantly findable through open

830
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,880
Siri

831
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,640
you provide viewers access to a larger

832
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,040
range of related resources so you will

833
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,900
need to discuss all these topics

834
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,220
yourself

835
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,060
and if you're really interested uh

836
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,099
you're welcome to join our stakeholder

837
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,619
group it helps here at the cre direction

838
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,020
if you're a standard maker

839
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,280
and

840
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,040
yeah that's all thank you very much for

841
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,680
for listening and let's make security

842
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,399
Better Together

843
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,079
thank you very much Robin's first for

844
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,420
this exciting presentation

845
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,180
thank you for making it so you know with

846
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,880
your passion you make me so interesting

847
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,200
to listen to

848
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,140
there is a at least one question in the

849
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,020
coin a for you

850
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,260
um open Siri topics require adoption and

851
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,420
incorporation into standards how are you

852
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,460
getting on with this task

853
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,500
are you in communication with what is

854
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,660
such Nissan

855
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,940
to have those Incorporated yes this is

856
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,099
this is of course our our biggest

857
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,839
challenge we had a number of technical

858
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,420
challenges that we solved those and it's

859
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,099
a it's of course a chicken and egg

860
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,900
situation because when you have nothing

861
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,780
and you approach a standard and you want

862
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,540
a cooperation it won't work so our

863
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,960
strategy is let's build uh connect a

864
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,900
number of standards and focus on on oops

865
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,200
so it's instantly uh useful and then

866
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,060
approach the various standards to Let's

867
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,420
Get on Board and demonstrate how cool it

868
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,400
is and how helpful it is and this this

869
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,579
presentation is part of this

870
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,680
um a promotion tour you could call it

871
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,320
that's necessary to show what you can do

872
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,000
with it to demonstrate what you can do

873
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,940
with it and to get these status on board

874
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,599
our strategy has been to First work uh

875
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,780
Within oasp and well you've seen the

876
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,579
standards that have been uh have been

877
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,980
adopted we're working for example with

878
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,680
the great guys from asvs to see how we

879
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,320
can get uh links machine readable links

880
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,800
in their resources so it's also

881
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,960
self-maintainable uh we're working with

882
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,720
uh Zap for example so we're working

883
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,960
together with these standards

884
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,099
that we want to adopt first at oasp and

885
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:18,599
when we have this working I think we

886
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,960
have a great case to approach uh the

887
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,180
nice people from uh from this and I

888
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,060
intend to approach Anissa as well and

889
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,180
monitor to see how we can how we can

890
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,420
collaborate and we want to make this as

891
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,460
open as possible which is why the

892
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,119
stakeholder group is is so important and

893
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,660
which is why we position it uh well as

894
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,640
an OS initiative but open outside of OAS

895
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,020
I think that's the only way to get uh

896
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,060
adoption from uh from standards outside

897
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,160
of Old West

898
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,200
so it makes sense anything to add Spiros

899
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,920
nope that's pretty cotton uh

900
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,099
one thing one small thing I guess uh if

901
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,099
you have contacts with any other

902
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,960
standards makers or

903
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,180
if by any chance you are a standards

904
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,380
maker let's talk we don't bite and let's

905
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,880
make this happen

906
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,619
you don't have to do

907
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,420
much or if anything and you gain so much

908
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,280
in return

909
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,320
maybe to add a little thing to that so

910
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,260
psychologically it's of course uh for a

911
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,599
standard maker who is used to control

912
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,640
these mappings uh him or herself it's a

913
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,119
step a step where you say Okay so we're

914
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,200
going to rely on open Siri to uh make it

915
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,880
easier for us and to find a lot of a lot

916
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,980
more resources than we currently do and

917
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,099
everything will stay up to date but it's

918
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,320
important

919
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,599
to to realize that this is a

920
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,520
psychological step where you put the

921
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,040
control of these mappings into the hands

922
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,599
of open Siri and this is why uh it's

923
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,040
very important to have this conversation

924
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,839
with these standards makers

925
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,839
and of course they always remain

926
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,700
involved as it is an open source project

927
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,599
and you can add issues and you can alter

928
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,240
links you can create pull requests Etc

929
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,980
it's it's a community effort

930
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,760
okay I hope this answers the question I

931
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,460
have another one do we have a kind of a

932
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,740
road map what kind of standards

933
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,500
are the next one on the Run be the

934
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,720
classical one being something like PCI

935
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,640
or all

936
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,339
Financial regulation stuff PCI being a

937
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,680
big one in North America but there are

938
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,240
others in Europe as well yes PCI is high

939
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,400
on the list we're talking about all wasp

940
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,480
SKF content also uh the Macs is

941
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,960
interesting uh

942
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,319
that's that's a short list uh as a short

943
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,359
list for now

944
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,000
okay so there is some planning happening

945
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,099
and it comes as it comes right

946
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,780
indeed

947
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,000
it also depends of course on the roadmap

948
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,920
of a certain standard standards have

949
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,280
their own cyclists where they working on

950
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,040
a new version and it's it's it's some

951
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,560
point in time it's not a good point uh

952
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,500
to to collaborate so it also depends on

953
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,240
uh when it's convenient for these

954
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,460
tenants maggots to engage

955
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,560
that makes sense

956
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,319
just out of the Curiosity do these cre

957
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,839
numbers have a meaning

958
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,280
yeah

959
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,400
well spirits

960
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,160
uh the meaning is that they are random

961
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,780
and

962
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,560
they are three random digits

963
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,020
a dozen three other random digits we

964
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,700
thought about

965
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,359
adding some sort of structure but

966
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,880
in our experience when we've seen this

967
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,339
kind of structure before I didn't really

968
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:12,660
provide

969
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,140
much benefit and it was too much trouble

970
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,900
for very little benefit it provided we

971
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,420
would also have to start reserving

972
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,440
ranges of Cris for future use but

973
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,060
security

974
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,700
changes quite often with new attacks and

975
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,480
new requirements coming all over all the

976
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,140
time so it would be quite hard and quite

977
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,300
distracting from our core mission

978
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,220
to link standards together

979
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,000
okay

980
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,780
you're obviously not coming with a new

981
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,900
standard you are coming with the logical

982
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,700
structure to organize

983
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,200
things

984
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,560
based on some kind of contents right

985
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,260
which means there are different opinions

986
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,700
on the topic

987
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,440
how do you deal with these different

988
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,180
opinions

989
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,380
good point

990
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,720
so indeed the topic structure is

991
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
something that we introduce but it's

992
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,940
also the result from everything that is

993
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,980
out there when you look at these

994
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,740
standards they may be perceived very

995
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,660
differently when when you look closely

996
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,960
they're very similar there is consensus

997
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,839
about certain things but there's also

998
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,079
differences in tastes at least well

999
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,040
first of all it's great that our topic

1000
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,760
structure is not a tree but a web

1001
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,500
Let Me Explain If You're Building uh a

1002
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,720
tree structure and then you're basically

1003
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,180
writing sort of a chapter and section

1004
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,579
and subsection structure

1005
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,819
it is you can have big debates on

1006
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,560
whether you put

1007
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,099
um

1008
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,099
uh preventing log injection into the

1009
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,400
input validation chapter or into the

1010
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,440
logging and error handling chapter big

1011
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,740
debates big fights

1012
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,420
but the nice thing is that if you have a

1013
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,520
semantic web you can have both

1014
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,520
so that solves part of this problem

1015
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,079
still things remain to a certain level

1016
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,660
opinionated for example we have a topic

1017
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,099
structure at a high level that's called

1018
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,380
logging and error handling and there may

1019
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,119
be people that say I would never put

1020
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,760
those two in the same topic well we we

1021
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,220
split after logging an error handling

1022
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,200
but we have a combined topic because

1023
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,740
they're so well so intertwined

1024
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:44,040
this can be a matter of maybe even sort

1025
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,839
of religious debates but they don't have

1026
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,000
bringing much sense it's nice to have

1027
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,060
them but you need to step over them and

1028
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,460
then decide okay if we're not going to

1029
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,980
decide on a structure it will never be

1030
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,020
possible to link everything together so

1031
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,000
we have to find each other and

1032
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,339
thankfully uh we have a semantic web

1033
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,359
instead of a semantic tree and we have a

1034
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,359
structure that's open source so we can

1035
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,940
talk about this right we can have

1036
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,700
discussions and then do a suggestion to

1037
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,520
change the structure if things change

1038
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,540
over time for example

1039
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,359
it's totally makes sense

1040
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,660
um maybe the last one you mentioned

1041
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,940
already the standards linking to you you

1042
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,240
also mentioned ISS

1043
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,660
for that does as fast already reference

1044
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,259
to Siri

1045
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,599
uh spirals is working on that with uh

1046
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,700
ICS what's the latest status

1047
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,780
so that's a good question so

1048
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,020
um asvs is releasing a new version

1049
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,900
sometime next year and we are working

1050
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,440
hard with them to find

1051
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,700
how we could

1052
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,060
integrate completely for now there is a

1053
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,599
pull request open towards the asbs

1054
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,460
repository adding

1055
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,319
links as a markdown table between asvs

1056
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,700
and cre

1057
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,240
and this allows asbs to link to crd very

1058
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,680
easily and without adding

1059
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,240
links to their existing text

1060
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,280
the great folks over at the SBS are very

1061
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,819
nice to work with so I believe we will

1062
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,260
manage to

1063
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,660
be in asbs version 5 next year

1064
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,700
plan

1065
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,619
I'm really looking forward to the

1066
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,660
exploring what you've done so far

1067
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,020
because I truly believe this will make

1068
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,839
our whole life so much easier on finding

1069
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,240
the right things at the right moment

1070
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,760
and with that I would really like to

1071
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,319
thank you for your work and for the

1072
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,200
presentation today and

1073
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,060
wish you all the best for the rest of

1074
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,040
the conference

1075
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,140
thank you very much thank you very much

1076
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,000
John and everybody thanks for your time
