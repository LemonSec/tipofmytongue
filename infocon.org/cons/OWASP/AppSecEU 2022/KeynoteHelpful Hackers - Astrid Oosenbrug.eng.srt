57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,160
who I am and well one of the things is

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,379
also I'm very into the hackers community

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,519
um and speaking of the hackers Community

60
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,440
uh

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,900
um I think you may know us I've heard of

62
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,480
us because one of our Founders uh Victor

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,660
havers uh had uh uh well I I wanted to

64
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,659
say pleasure to hack the Twitter account

65
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,159
of uh

66
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,220
Trump two times not one time but even

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,879
two times he tried to warn him uh they

68
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,360
didn't respond so after a uh well

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,840
sometime he got to talk to the people

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
who could fix it so it took a long time

71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,580
and we even asked the Dutch government

72
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,659
to help us and they did and another

73
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,980
thing uh Dave they did is

74
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,580
um

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,799
uh the cassaya uh Sierra Day heck

76
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,799
um and we were almost there to make it

77
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,280
to save the day but we tripped at uh at

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,299
the finish so uh that was a a painful

79
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,940
moment but also a good moment because we

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,120
really did a lot so to stop this but it

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,819
felt like it finished with trip so

82
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
um I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

83
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,099
the history and the future of day today

84
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,358
uh in um October 2018 we really started

85
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,899
uh and we as Victor havers Clifford and

86
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,280
me

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,520
uh because we thought that the world has

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,300
to be a digital safe place for everybody

89
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,740
and for me it was really really

90
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,740
important because uh

91
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,620
around my 30 uh

92
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,759
um age of 30 I uh I was DeForest and my

93
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,979
only Lifeline to the rest of the world I

94
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,520
was a single mom with two little kids

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,580
and my only place to get knowledge to

96
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,520
educate myself to make friends to talk

97
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
to other people who watch the internet

98
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,020
so for me it felt like a very very safe

99
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,380
place I met a lot of people I learned a

100
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,800
lot I even found a job through the

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,860
internet in those days so

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,960
um for me it's really important to keep

103
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,199
it a safe place so people like me who

104
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,720
maybe for them it's a live line at the

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,699
moment in their life it's a safe place

106
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,880
so you can meet meet new people

107
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,919
um so that's why we started because we

108
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,320
all the the three of us we had the same

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,139
ideas about that internet has to be a

110
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,680
safe place systems have to be safe

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,380
uh shall we start it uh day every day at

112
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,460
Dr now

113
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,100
and then we found out that there's also

114
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,639
it was really Dutch uh that also we had

115
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,699
to uh scan the whole world because

116
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,340
internet doesn't stop at uh at the

117
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,000
borders so we also made certain global

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,160
and then we thought we have to learn our

119
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,800
kids to do it on a safe way shall we

120
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,900
start a day-to-day Academy

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,199
and because we get a lot of uh funding

122
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,380
uh these days we also started day-to-day

123
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,139
funds so I will explain later about all

124
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,180
these uh organizations do

125
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,840
let's start with a D in difd the d

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,780
stands for Dutch you could

127
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,860
somehow get that I think and the d The

128
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,780
Dutch stands also for the Dutch

129
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,139
mentality uh we think we believe in an

130
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,319
open honest collaborative and for free

131
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,020
mentality

132
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,680
um and we try to to get that in uh in a

133
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,199
code of conduct it's on our site you can

134
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,600
read it because we made some uh

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,180
agreements together because we want to

136
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,100
be open because we want to be honest

137
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,860
because we want to be collaborative and

138
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,160
we want to be we do it for free we also

139
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,880
need to set up a set of rules and so we

140
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
did with the code of conduct

141
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,479
um

142
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,780
but we also have an international reach

143
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,960
and that's a bit weird because it's

144
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,060
dutch but

145
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,280
um internet doesn't stop at the board as

146
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,220
I said so you can scan but then you scan

147
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,259
the whole world because you never know

148
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,160
who is behind uh IP address

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
the I stands for institute

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,060
and we started to Institute with Victor

151
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,479
occasion Astrid then from grade I came

152
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,819
and some other people came and we had a

153
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,380
small group of people

154
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,099
uh and it grew and it grew in a grill

155
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,500
and now we have a

156
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,300
a

157
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,720
H yeah we said

158
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,259
but it's the uh now wow it's a board uh

159
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,340
above the board I just look at us we

160
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,060
have a director now and we have uh seven

161
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,560
uh different uh organizations uh with

162
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,199
all the uh they all have their own team

163
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,280
lead and under their uh the team lead

164
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,860
there are different stuff all these

165
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,360
people do

166
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,120
and that's a lot so we started at a

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,419
small as a small volunteer organization

168
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,539
and now we have about

169
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,520
120 volunteers and you all have to

170
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
manage that so that's a weird thing

171
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
because we're all like hackers and nerds

172
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,458
and Geeks and whatever and where we all

173
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,679
think we are not really organized and if

174
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,559
you look at this picture you see we are

175
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,080
very organized

176
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,719
the fee stands for vulnerability

177
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,540
and uh well we we've we're thinking

178
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,760
about what kind of vulnerabilities uh

179
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,220
are we looking for and we've uh

180
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,100
we split it up in three kind of cases

181
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,040
just the critical uh vulnerabilities

182
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,500
like uh

183
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,720
when you have the cache a cage or like

184
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,680
the lock for Jay or uh it's just a

185
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,899
vulnerability everybody knows it's in

186
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,519
the news and then we start scanning

187
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,100
because we want to make sure it gets off

188
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,440
the internet as soon as possible out of

189
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,600
the systems

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,820
um then we also have the data leaks

191
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,279
where we get uh where we can see

192
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
databases where there are personal

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
credentials and then we're gonna start

194
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,200
uh

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,600
make sure the people whose credentials

196
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,640
are leaked to make sure they get a note

197
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,640
uh get notified because well we all know

198
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,320
if you're a password and your login name

199
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,940
is note a note somewhere well people can

200
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,240
make uh use of that in a bad way so you

201
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,459
have to be sure these people get

202
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,519
notified as soon as possible and then

203
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,660
the third vulnerability we do is share

204
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,680
days some of our researchers

205
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
find zero days themselves sometimes we

206
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,320
get them offered by other people

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,360
researchers who found a zero day and

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,300
don't want to get all the hustle to

209
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,440
start talking to the offender or to the

210
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,339
the software the developer and they just

211
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,200
say please

212
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
um can you do something about it and

213
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,839
then we take it as the the ipd and we

214
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,080
talk to Defenders and the software

215
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,120
developers and this was the case in

216
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,660
cachea for example

217
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
um now you see if you look at the

218
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,540
critical uh vulnerabilities you get uh

219
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,339
it's getting the news and if you see

220
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,459
like she tricks was one of the big

221
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,320
vulnerabilities and then we started

222
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,990
scanning

223
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,160
[Music]

224
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,740
persecure The Exchange proxy logo on

225
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,240
[Music]

226
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
and and then we just start uh scanning

227
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,360
scanning scanning and make sure that all

228
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,220
the systems every time we see a system

229
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,380
that has the vulnerability we sent an

230
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,839
email uh if they don't respond to the

231
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,320
email we uh we'll even phone them we

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
will try to find out uh who the person

233
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,380
is who can fix uh the vulnerability

234
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
because we don't fix the vulnerabilities

235
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,779
we only scan we find the leaks and then

236
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,560
we notify the people who can fix it

237
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,579
for victim notifications

238
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,279
we use our own and but also third-party

239
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,200
research sometimes other people tell us

240
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,560
we found this uh database it's open blah

241
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,440
blah blah well we had a Mirai we had a

242
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,620
warehouse but we had Telegram

243
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,519
um

244
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,040
and we noticed that it's often very

245
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,860
difficult for public agencies to handle

246
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,700
because sometimes even you need the

247
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,100
government to

248
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,720
tell

249
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,540
organizations that they have a leak but

250
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,459
somehow there's always something wrong

251
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,680
with

252
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,620
that a law will work against them or

253
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,540
something and we are a volunteer

254
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,899
organization we can just notify

255
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,600
everybody we want and they can like it

256
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,019
or not but we are working

257
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,940
within the lines of the law and that's

258
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,160
different for a volunteer organization

259
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,360
than for a company or for a government

260
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,300
and then we have the zero days with uh

261
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,200
cachea was found by one of our

262
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,060
researchers we had family

263
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,820
so that's also what we do we do a lot of

264
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,480
um research in software and sometimes we

265
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,660
find uh the leaks ourselves and we start

266
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,560
talking to the fenders or the developers

267
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
to make sure they fix

268
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,540
the leaks in the software because it's

269
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,000
an accident waiting to happen because if

270
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
we if our research is found find it then

271
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,940
bad people will find it too so it's

272
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,620
always a raise against the clock and

273
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,279
that's what happens with cachea uh we

274
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
just did a race against the clock

275
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,660
and then the most important part I think

276
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,459
is the disclosure

277
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,399
uh because that's what the mission of

278
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,180
the ipd is because we aim to make the

279
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,880
digital world safer and this is the most

280
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,519
important important thing

281
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,700
by reporting vulnerabilities we find in

282
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
digital systems to the people who can

283
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,899
fix them

284
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,579
uh and we also have a global reach but

285
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,100
do it Dutch style open on a collaborate

286
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
and for free I already told you but the

287
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,380
the most important part is we report the

288
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,820
vulnerabilities

289
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
that we find in the digital systems and

290
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,519
we we report them to the people who can

291
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,600
fix them

292
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,120
and that's a really uh

293
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,300
uh important part because we really need

294
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,440
your help so we have our own uh RS which

295
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,240
came from the range

296
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,560
uh you see uh

297
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,019
194573.0 24 shall we have our own IP

298
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,680
range and if you ever get a report and

299
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
you're not the one who can fix it but

300
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,260
please forward it to the person who can

301
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,320
because what we do is like we did at uh

302
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,000
cachea we found a lot of open instances

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,100
uh we started uh scanning we started uh

304
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,800
sending out a report and then uh in in a

305
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
few days you see it's the all the leaks

306
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,620
are going down so it really works it

307
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,740
really helps and well we are a bunch of

308
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,680
uh volunteers

309
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,040
and we can do it alone so this is what

310
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,420
we really need

311
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,540
uh for the disclosure we are reporting

312
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,720
it to the ones that fix and we also work

313
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,060
together with uh trusted information

314
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,540
sharing Partners uh one of the partners

315
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,600
is the national cyber security Center uh

316
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,300
digital trust Center digital trust

317
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,160
Center in the Netherlands but also the

318
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,459
uh the search uh

319
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,019
um so there's

320
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,779
and maybe that's also the Dutch culture

321
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,519
because we work together with the

322
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,680
governments with organizations with

323
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,019
companies whatever just to make the

324
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,959
world the digital world of a better

325
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,320
place we also have a lot of contacts via

326
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,940
the network providers and if all else

327
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,639
feels we have direct contact with phone

328
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,339
uh companies we found people to make

329
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,220
sure it gets fixed

330
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,519
International we now have c-shirt Global

331
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,199
it's run by ay3 house and they do it in

332
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,279
the same way

333
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,579
but only International so if the leakage

334
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,380
not in the Netherlands or the company or

335
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,519
whatever then Seashore Global will make

336
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,760
sure they phone the people or or go to

337
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,920
the people who in that country like in

338
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,399
Germany America uh England we have a lot

339
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,320
of contexts already all over the world

340
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,639
France Belgium so we make the world uh

341
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,399
one big

342
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,820
disclosure Paradise I would say

343
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,160
uh what we also do is the victim

344
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,399
notification and then we try to uh

345
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,600
contact the victim directly mostly by

346
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,579
email if they don't respond to email

347
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,360
then we will go to the site operators we

348
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,579
will phone them

349
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,639
and we're working together with no more

350
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,360
leaks initiative because they do the

351
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,060
same stuff also and we really believe in

352
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,880
joining forces together so together we

353
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,520
are strong and make this world a safer

354
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,780
place

355
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,839
in the Sierra days uh well we work

356
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,040
within the CCD guidelines we can we can

357
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,099
even make our own cvds now uh we are

358
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,900
reporting to Defender

359
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,599
uh and afterwards we just

360
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,359
uh treated like just another critical

361
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,760
vulnerability so we start scanning again

362
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
we start uh

363
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,179
reporting it to the people who still has

364
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,760
the software on their machine

365
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,440
so circles are around in this case and

366
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,900
well then we go to the Institute

367
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,260
uh in our research or our ethical

368
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,720
hackers as you wish there are three

369
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,940
levels levels one two and three where

370
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,419
level one is really like uh you go to

371
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,480
Showdown you you see what's leak and you

372
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,000
do a scan on on uh stuff you see there

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,059
level three a two is a bit higher and

374
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,700
level three is really zero day so uh you

375
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,539
get as uh the longer you are with the uh

376
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,360
the ipd the more credits you earn and

377
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
you can grow in level so it's also a

378
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,940
trust issue

379
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,760
um and everybody earns the trust by

380
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,460
being a volunteer and spend time a day

381
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,240
today

382
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,200
uh research also work on finding uh

383
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,480
vulnerabilities they do scanning and

384
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,200
they find zero days

385
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,660
we also have our own sea shirt

386
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,200
and that works on the triage they look

387
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,860
how big is this uh what the is this

388
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,620
really a a big issue or can we leave it

389
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,580
for a week or for two days or

390
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,260
they also take care of the publication

391
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,880
like if the a journalist phones they

392
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,539
want to make a a story about it a

393
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,980
c-shirt will make sure it's it's

394
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,419
the technical details are all in order

395
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:15,240
they also keep the fender relations so

396
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,700
they take care of when they find a

397
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,140
shiver day or a vulnerability they they

398
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,520
talk to the fenders

399
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
and what's very important they write a

400
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,460
report so from the day they start till

401
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,740
the very end and all the reports are

402
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,200
also on the sides of day to day you can

403
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,840
read them they're very interesting I

404
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,919
think because you see uh how every

405
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,919
um uh

406
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,980
leak is handled and uh from day one till

407
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,400
the closing moment and as soon as it's

408
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
closed then the report will be online

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,760
then we also because we are growing and

410
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,100
growing we also have an own operations

411
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
uh group they take care of the skin

412
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,299
infra I'm not sure if you can imagine

413
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:09,360
how many uh machines we have running to

414
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
scan the internet 24 7 the whole

415
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,740
internet 24 7 yeah seven days a week so

416
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,320
um they make sure it's all uh it's all

417
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,760
up and running we have our own help desk

418
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,220
for the people at the volunteers a day

419
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,820
today with their own questions but also

420
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,280
uh well if offender has a question they

421
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,760
can also ask at operations

422
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,620
and they take care of all the

423
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,160
applications we use because well we are

424
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
whole here we have to be holier than the

425
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,559
pope so our applications really need to

426
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,460
be in order uh make sure we don't have

427
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,320
our own League to make sure we take a

428
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,380
good care of every piece of software we

429
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,860
use and we also want to make uh develop

430
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,500
our own applications everything open

431
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,940
source of course and we have for every

432
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,679
um

433
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,900
uh group we have our own website and

434
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,960
they take care of the websites too so

435
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,900
it's the operations is the the biggest

436
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,080
group well the the biggest growing group

437
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,640
at the moment

438
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,640
then we have the HRM the the human

439
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,039
research manager they take care of the

440
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,020
onboarding and off-boarding

441
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,340
uh because every volunteer can uh send I

442
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,900
want to be a volunteer day every day

443
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,179
then you get a talk uh what do you want

444
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,480
to do uh we talk about training because

445
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,960
we think every volunteer should be part

446
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,159
of uh uh day today and also feel they

447
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,700
can grow themselves so if you are a help

448
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,400
desk person maybe you want to learn more

449
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,980
about

450
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,360
research then you can learn more about

451
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,860
research and then when you talk about

452
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,860
what training do you need whatever we

453
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,380
also have a counselor because we also

454
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,539
want to be a safe space for everybody uh

455
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,179
uh we want to be inclusive and diverse

456
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,059
and everybody should feel safe so we

457
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,880
really have a counselor who can uh well

458
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,640
if you ever think like I'm not treated

459
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,580
well or I don't feel safe you can talk

460
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,980
to the counselor and he or she will help

461
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,720
you

462
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,700
to figure things out so that sounds very

463
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,880
professional too and it's funny man well

464
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,500
I think it's funny because we are a

465
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,740
volunteer uh group of hackers and we are

466
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,240
very well organized as you see and then

467
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,260
we have our own communication uh

468
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,919
a group they take care of the payer

469
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,220
they do the publication of blocks we

470
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,280
also write blogs and they make sure

471
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,200
every

472
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,120
we can be at events but also make our

473
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,740
own events for the people in the

474
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,260
Netherlands we have hack talks that's

475
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,419
really uh nice but they're mostly in

476
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,700
Dutch so that's

477
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,240
um

478
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,520
well if you don't speak Dutch it's a bit

479
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,679
hard but the heck talks are always very

480
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,200
interesting because we there are people

481
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,640
who has no background in Tech or hacking

482
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,260
or whatever and there's a lot of people

483
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,340
who have and then they just start a

484
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,140
conversation together and we learn from

485
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,140
each other so you last time we had

486
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,039
somebody who was hacked uh and he told

487
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
what it is to his company how much time

488
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,760
it costs how much stress and it was

489
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,020
really

490
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,039
uh good for us to wear because we do a

491
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,020
notification but we never think about

492
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,940
from what really happens at the moment

493
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,760
some some uh company gets a notification

494
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,980
and then you see there can be a lot of

495
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,880
stress so we're also working on that

496
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,220
um and we have merchandise like my own

497
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,559
t-shirt I'm not sure if you can see it

498
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,159
but uh and we're thinking about uh well

499
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,820
spreading uh uh the love of Dave today

500
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,740
so we want to share more with

501
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,059
merchandise like uh uh stickers t-shirts

502
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,480
whatever so people will know us all

503
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,280
around the world

504
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,539
and then Finance I was the treasurer for

505
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,520
some time and it really gave me a

506
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
headache so I'm glad it's outsourced now

507
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,460
because there's more money uh getting in

508
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,020
so it needs and then you see that in in

509
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,520
the whole

510
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,419
um uh volunteer organization there

511
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,400
weren't much people who are really good

512
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,840
uh at Finance in a way so it's no shame

513
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,179
to say that we outsourced it and we are

514
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,760
very happy with it so

515
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,539
uh and then we also have compliance

516
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,940
as I said we have to be holier than the

517
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,220
pope because we are really well people

518
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,340
are looking at us uh and we have to do

519
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,440
it in a very good way shall we have our

520
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,600
own security officer we have a privacy

521
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
officer we have a seashell uh and we

522
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,440
also have our own uh committees uh one

523
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,299
of them it's really important because

524
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,580
maybe I should have started with that

525
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,820
but ethics is the number one lesson at

526
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,820
Dave day we do our work in an ethical

527
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,620
way uh for us it's a no-brainer but well

528
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,080
I met some people

529
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,200
um who aren't

530
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,299
that much into ethics so

531
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,900
that was really a a thing with well we

532
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,360
have to start our own committee and make

533
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,600
sure that ethics is a subject and

534
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
diversity and inclusion because in the

535
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,840
I.T world there's a lot of talk about

536
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,179
why aren't there the many women or why

537
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,200
uh why is it all uh the same people and

538
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,220
I think

539
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,380
as long as you don't talk about it it

540
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,140
will never change so if we address the

541
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,860
problem and we start thinking together

542
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,600
how can we fix it I think that's a

543
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,600
better way than just always say like oh

544
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,220
there are no women in cyber security

545
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,220
because I know a lot of women in cyber

546
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,100
security so that's uh also very

547
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,240
important to think to yourself and what

548
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,520
words do you use how do you talk to each

549
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,220
other how do you address other people

550
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,600
and

551
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,020
well there's a lot of lessons learned

552
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:45,240
our seashell started her own uh uh group

553
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,640
of people who wanted to want to learn

554
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,100
how to how it is to be a seashell so now

555
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,740
we have four people who are training

556
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,500
their shelves in becoming an uh Chief

557
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,799
Information Security Officer so uh

558
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,559
that's also the the fun part about being

559
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,440
part of a volunteer organization you

560
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,020
don't get paid in money but you get paid

561
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,840
in knowledge and uh in training

562
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,580
um and then we get to the c-shirt global

563
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,539
because uh we are really proud because

564
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,400
uh c-short Global is also a

565
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,080
volunteer-led uh non-profit organization

566
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,240
um but only there are uh uh more

567
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,760
internationality uh

568
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,539
uh organized yes so they do the same as

569
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:40,080
we do at the uh they uh dipd

570
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,299
only they aim to find report and

571
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,840
disclose vulnerability globally so as we

572
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,820
scan in the Netherlands in a in a group

573
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,120
of Dutch IPS altogether or we just scan

574
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,580
and

575
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,400
notify the Dutch people organizations

576
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,360
whatever uh c-short Global is notifying

577
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,500
the people all around the globe so uh

578
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,840
what we're uh what they are working on

579
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,419
is an international corporation there's

580
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,840
building chapters around the globe we

581
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,779
look at owasp uh

582
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,600
uh to learn from our watch how you do

583
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,539
that and one of the chapters that will

584
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,600
start real soon I think is in England

585
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,059
and that would be great and then we try

586
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,940
to well conquer the whole world uh by

587
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,520
making all these chapters because what

588
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,900
we found we met that uh

589
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,179
uh what happened is that the laws and

590
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,419
regulations uh are different in

591
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,919
different countries and we know the

592
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,900
Dutch law I know the Dutch law but I

593
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,400
don't know everything about other

594
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,919
countries so it's really important for

595
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,840
us to have chapters in other countries

596
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,559
so we can learn from them how you make a

597
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,179
good

598
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:00,860
um

599
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,520
disclosure is there a rule what are the

600
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,580
uh the chances you get arrested so we

601
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,480
have to really find find out uh so and

602
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,760
to spread

603
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,520
um the legal risk we started t-shirt

604
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,679
Global so it's their it's their own

605
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,460
Foundation but it's well powered by the

606
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,279
ipd with the same code of conduct with

607
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:30,120
the shame ethic Roots uh uh also

608
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,840
volunteer-led with the same uh well uh

609
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,220
blueprint of uh day every day

610
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,240
and then we get to my uh well my dream

611
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,140
and my my heart and my everything that's

612
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
the day-to-day Academy

613
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,600
I started five years ago a short like uh

614
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,080
program to help young hackers uh to stay

615
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,840
out of trouble because I talked to the

616
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,779
government I talked to the police and

617
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,559
sometimes they uh go into a house at

618
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,720
five o'clock in the morning and get a

619
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,600
kid of 12 years old out of his bed

620
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,860
because he had something and uh and the

621
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,039
kids were like I did nothing wrong I

622
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,440
just looked there and I could buy some

623
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,220
stuff without paying and they think it's

624
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,559
all fun and

625
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,340
um and we really want to teach the kids

626
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,919
about Atco hacking

627
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,080
um that you can really make a earn a

628
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,059
living if you want

629
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,880
um that they are

630
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,000
good people and not a bad like they are

631
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,340
treated sometimes by school because a

632
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,620
lot of our youngsters uh the first thing

633
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,080
they do is heck their school

634
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,039
and then some schools uh are not amused

635
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,440
and send them home or take away their

636
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,779
computer or whatever I think that's a

637
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:06,000
really dumb idea to do the other uh side

638
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,919
is sometimes you have schools they are

639
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,960
really happy with kids like that and

640
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,200
they ask them to scan their Network help

641
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,020
them to make a school a better place and

642
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,100
a more safe place what uh and sometimes

643
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
we get youngsters who are not going to

644
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
school anymore because they don't feel

645
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,020
welcome or they don't understand what's

646
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,360
asked of them and when you talk to them

647
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,260
they are so brilliant with other stuff

648
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,539
and we think at Davey Day Academy we can

649
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,600
learn them uh the other stuff we can

650
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,020
make sure they get a good future

651
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,659
uh because these kids are our next

652
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,260
Generation we need their brains we need

653
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,720
their skills we need everything but the

654
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,539
schooling in the Netherlands is not

655
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:57,360
ready for a kids like this this so my

656
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,880
heart is really with uh the kid from The

657
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Academy

658
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,299
uh I dropped out of school when I was 15

659
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,940
and I made it to a member of parliament

660
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,820
so for me only the sky is the limit and

661
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,039
I know I can get the very best out of

662
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,159
every kit especially our well our little

663
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,700
hackers hacker kids so uh

664
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,059
and what can we teach them uh we now

665
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,120
have online

666
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,880
place where we want to fill the lessons

667
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,580
which well for me the fundamentals are

668
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,500
really uh uh the ocean layer for INS uh

669
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,480
instance because nobody ever learns

670
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,399
about the LC layer anymore I think

671
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,860
that's weird we learned I'm about

672
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,640
ethical aspects because I think you can

673
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,179
be a good hacker without be also take

674
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,440
the ethical aspects in your whole

675
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,200
uh well your whole life

676
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
um we teach them about a t-shirt what it

677
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,779
is what can you do there uh What uh

678
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,240
skills do you need we learned them about

679
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,820
incident response because they are a lot

680
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,760
of uh online they find a lot of stuff

681
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,919
and then they send the mail to somebody

682
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,880
say hey stupid you have a leak in your

683
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,399
software uh maybe you should fix it and

684
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,799
then they get to me and say yeah that's

685
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,860
right I send a meal but I never got the

686
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,080
answer no because you didn't do it in

687
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,120
the right way so we're teaching them how

688
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,659
to make a good uh responsible disclosure

689
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,799
what report do you send uh uh and it's

690
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,679
working because well they get happier

691
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,620
every day uh we learn them about social

692
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,600
engineering and we learn them about

693
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,120
investigation online offshores

694
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,799
intelligence

695
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,159
we learn them about malware research

696
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,059
offensive security we learn them all the

697
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,600
stuff we know and the funny thing is

698
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,100
um it's all in our heads we have all the

699
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,899
volunteers a day every day are all

700
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,700
professionals

701
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,580
but we all teach most of our knowledge

702
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,500
we teach ourselves

703
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,560
to ourselves so now we try to get it all

704
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,280
out of our heads and put it into lessons

705
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,639
uh to learn uh well the young shares and

706
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,699
also the students from the University

707
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,239
whatever because we think it's really

708
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,339
important you learn all the stuff and

709
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:33,239
not only uh on on paper but you should

710
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,440
also do it you should do a real online

711
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,918
investigation uh before you go to uh say

712
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,599
well I have my uh uh I have my diploma

713
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,679
but you never did an online uh

714
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,780
investigation that's not something that

715
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,639
computes with us so

716
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,680
um and last but not least we also have

717
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,080
the ipd fund

718
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,280
uh because we also get donations uh

719
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,040
and we were thinking like okay we get a

720
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,200
donations

721
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,720
um what do we do with them some of the

722
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,420
money they say well you we got money

723
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,000
from Huntress and they said well we give

724
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,460
you a piece of the money we want you to

725
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,520
build a zero day uh platform

726
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,760
and you get other part of the money and

727
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,500
you can do whatever you want to do with

728
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,180
it

729
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,480
um so we were thinking about okay what

730
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,040
can we do with the money to make the

731
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,220
world a better place uh and then we

732
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,099
thought well maybe we should make an Own

733
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,960
Foundation also the divd fund uh we put

734
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,680
the money in there and people can uh uh

735
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,740
sign in for a project and uh the only

736
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,380
thing we ask is that they contribute to

737
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,579
the mission of day today

738
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,040
um from day to day self or external

739
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,520
parties who have the same Mission Vision

740
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,099
and that's how to make the digital world

741
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,940
safer so uh the fund is still growing we

742
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,520
are not that rich at the moment but we

743
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,619
the more donations we get the more

744
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:22,500
projects we can Finance uh and that

745
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,240
would be really really

746
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,420
uh night because together I said it a

747
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,820
few times together we are stronger and

748
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,160
together we can really make the digital

749
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,680
world safer uh and from the uh divd we

750
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,320
do it from out a hackers mental

751
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,380
mentality but also the software has to

752
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,520
be safe also what ovas does uh

753
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,579
contribute to that mission uh so there's

754
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,760
a lot of Open Source uh projects at the

755
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
moment that can really help to make the

756
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,920
world uh digital safer and we want to be

757
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,520
part of that we want to fund that show

758
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,859
and that's why we started uh day-to-day

759
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,140
funds

760
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,260
and I think I'm talking to um

761
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,440
fast so I'm just gonna

762
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
uh

763
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,160
tell this again about the white list we

764
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,119
have

765
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,500
um

766
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,960
because it's really important we scan

767
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,280
with this as all the systems at the

768
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,060
internet at this moment and there are

769
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,359
systems that are vulnerable we send in a

770
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,119
a a a

771
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,359
notify and not all the notifies get uh

772
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,540
to the right place so it's very very

773
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,599
very important for us that the notifiers

774
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,359
get to the right people so they can

775
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,160
start

776
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,160
fixing them because the internet is

777
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,060
broken

778
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,720
we I think we already know that and our

779
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,420
Dream at day today is that we fix it

780
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,859
together and we can all uh make it a

781
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,380
place again where information can be

782
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,500
found where uh we can a community uh

783
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,780
communicate with each other because if

784
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,660
one thing of the covet learned us we

785
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,240
can't live without the internet we can't

786
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,920
live without systems we can't live

787
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,619
without communicate with each other in a

788
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,480
digital way

789
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,940
um so it's very

790
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,500
important that we shave the internet

791
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,420
that we fix it that we help each other

792
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,520
[Music]

793
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,260
yeah and that's

794
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,140
I think what I really wanted to say

795
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,320
so now I can oh this one all right this

796
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,260
is more the the questions if you have

797
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,320
general questions uh you can find us on

798
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,440
Twitter we have our own website uh

799
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,900
uh if you want to be a volunteer you can

800
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,119
go to Davey daytonelle and become a

801
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,640
volunteer so

802
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,180
um

803
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,460
yeah I can talk for hours Martin but

804
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,720

805
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,240
thank you I said uh great presentation

I will be there in this pronunciation

808
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,060
dust we have uh actually two questions

809
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,240
uh one is uh to whom did you Outsource

810
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,440
your finances

811
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,780
another volunteer organization

812
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,520
uh no the two uh we uh also have our own

813
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,820
uh Contour uh

814
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,220
of course we have our own office and

815
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,500
that office also uh

816
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,140
uh has their own Finance

817
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,579
organization and the finance

818
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,599
organization is a company that's taking

819
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,140
care of foundation so it's also Fallen

820
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,599
not volunteer but they work a lot for

821
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,839
volunteer organizations and it's also a

822
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,420
small group so

823
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,800
okay so another question is is the dipd

824
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
Academy open to everybody around the

825
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,920
world

826
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,900
yes because uh well it's from two sides

827
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,960
uh we have an online version and we're

828
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,800
gonna fill it with online lessons and uh

829
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,260
we wanted uh to do it in the same way as

830
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,400
we do at the uh the ipd uh open free

831
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,440
everybody can use it and we also do uh

832
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,859
clusters and they will be held in uh in

833
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,660
Netherlands in The Hague with a small

834
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,720
group and uh then they get like more

835
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,800
masterclass like bgp hijacking we talk

836
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,579
about fundamental uh

837
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:49,920
uh non-tech technical that's what

838
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,940
it is NTS

839
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,900
so we do more uh deepening about

840
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,599
subjects but the online lessons will be

841
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,720
available for everybody who wants to uh

842
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,660
well learn more because what I see and

843
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,900
it really annoys me is that you get

844
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,359
Cyber training everywhere around the

845
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,460
world and you have to pay like 10 000

846
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,500
whatever

847
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,240
for lessons

848
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,119
it's not that hard everybody can learn

849
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,300
it if you are interested and I'm really

850
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,780
from the school of information wants to

851
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,960
be free and it's our yeah it's our

852
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,680
everybody knows how to handle uh a a

853
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,339
subject and why should I earn 10 000 uh

854
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:42,359
whatever dollars or Euros for a simple

855
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,700
lesson because I have the knowledge no I

856
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,440
want to share my knowledge

857
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,619
and I can earn money in other ways

858
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,940
so yes everybody can take lessons and

859
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,800
they will be free so

860
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,720
yeah it's every something that we can

861
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,520
wear together also because we have some

862
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,579
free available material as always we

863
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,040
want to show you let me see uh

864
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,900
uh let me see there was a question I

865
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,660
added difd Academy videos on in Dutch

866
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,500
uh yeah we had uh there's one video from

867
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,140
hectok and I think it's in Dutch Shell

868
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,020
but we try to

869
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,599
[Music]

870
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,140
um

871
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,800
make more material and do it in English

872
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,020
okay so yeah

873
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,440
uh with another question

874
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,400
um

875
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,000
foreign

876
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,940
register as ends

877
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,520
or other IP arranges to ensure you can

878
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,800
reach us think about what shutter

879
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,820
service

880
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,500
has done with their subscription service

881
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,119
uh I'm not sure if I understand the

882
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,680
question good enough but we work

883
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,200
together also with shadow sheriffer

884
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,800
um and we have all the IP ranges video

885
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,859
scan the whole internet and some people

886
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,460
block us

887
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,319
um are are arranged but well that's

888
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,560
their loss I think because our uh

889
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,020
uh mission is to make the internet a

890
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,300
safe place and we do that from

891
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,500
um

892
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,260
from out our uh from our own range sorry

893
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,359
yeah I was thinking about it yeah I just

894
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,400
put a question in your chat so that you

895
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,040
have the complete question

896
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,579
foreign

897
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,380
yes

898
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,079
um uh there's also yeah but that's the

899
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,380
Dutch version we have the cyber the

900
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,960
cyber security Melbourne and people can

901
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,680
put their uh share their IP addresses uh

902
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,280
with uh with it uh and maybe she shared

903
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,859
Global will do that but I'm not sure at

904
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,720
day if the day we work the other way

905
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,560
around we we don't we scan everything

906
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,640
so we don't let people

907
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,420
opt in but you can opt out by saying oh

908
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm gonna block this as

909
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,740
cool let me see

910
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,819
full-time workers

911
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,500
tipd has a minimum amount of hours

912
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,660
required in order to take part

913
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,520
for volunteers yeah

914
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,319
no because some people have two hours a

915
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,839
week and others have like 20 hours a

916
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:40,079
week and especially the research part is

917
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,660
really uh

918
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,599
uh intense because we we do scan the

919
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,960
whole internet and it not stops uh with

920
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,060
that but it starts with that because if

921
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,400
you get a range and you know then you

922
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,380
have to send the notifications a lot of

923
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,319
uh it is done

924
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,640
automated at the moment

925
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,060
but the most of the work is in the uh

926
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,680
the

927
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,560
messages you get back like okay the

928
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,140
abuse address is not working the info

929
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,480
address is not working so then you have

930
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,020
to really have to look up the IP address

931
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,500
have to look up okay who's behind that

932
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,500
machine and then you can try to uh get

933
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,660
to them in another way and that's cost

934
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,160
more time and but you can do say if I if

935
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,200
you have two hours left you can or if

936
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,980
maybe six hours a month it's also what

937
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,920
would you like to contribute to day

938
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
today

939
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,599
I think uh as we discussed earlier so

940
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,460
there's this initiative to have to

941
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,280
security dot txt a security text file

942
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,560
with contact details how to report a

943
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,960
vulnerability yeah

944
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,000
I think as you said that some companies

945
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,800
are afraid to get hacked when you

946
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,140
actually put it on the website yeah we

947
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,940
also sometimes get messages from uh we

948
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,920
don't want you to read our security text

949
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,400
or they they take the text away or yeah

950
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,400
that that's also a thing maybe we have

951
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,760
to think about we still have a lot to

952
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,160
teach other people and companies and

953
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,900
whatever because they make themselves

954
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,599
vulnerable because they are afraid that

955
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,460
we are the bad guys but we are the good

956
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,240
guys

957
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,060
so that's why I do talks like this to

958
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,339
explain that we really want to make the

959
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,500
internet a safer place for everybody so

960
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,800
our kids can enjoy it to uh

961
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,700
uh like a single mom single dads uh if

962
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,119
you're isolated you can still talk to

963
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,480
other people because in a safe way and

964
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,540
not while you're online then your bank

965
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,520
account get hacked or something that's

966
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,920
not really what you want if you're

967
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,740
already in a position where you're well

968
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,380
feeling down or whatever so

969
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,140
yeah I think that it's uh awareness and

970
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,599
very spreading it's one big thing which

971
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,400
you have to do I think there was a nice

972
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,260
Story Once from

973
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,619
Victor when he said he had to travel to

974
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,420
Africa and one government said what

975
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,160
should we do to get more secure and he

976
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,260
said first of all don't execute your

977
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,180
hackers right it's like yeah let them

978
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,400
hack let them help you I think that's

979
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,660
the difference when you go to different

980
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,619
cultures or countries where

981
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:26,579
understanding of hacking is differently

982
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:27,660
and I think the Netherlands they're

983
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,380
quite liberal on that part yeah yeah I

984
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,480
didn't tell the whole story but it

985
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,339
helped that I was a member of parliament

986
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,359
from 2012 to 2015 I was the one and only

987
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,940
real uh uh well technical uh Member of

988
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,760
Parliament and our helps the people who

989
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,060
wanted a responsible disclosure uh to

990
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,420
get it in in the law I helped it as a

991
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,339
and that really helped because the

992
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:59,520
responsible disclosure uh

993
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,619
really helped our

994
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,119
well our foundation also to do what we

995
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,700
do now because it's in the law it says

996
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,819
you can do responsible disclosures

997
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,420
and that's really unique I think for uh

998
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,099
the world that's in in the Netherlands

999
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,859
we started this and now we are lobbying

1000
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,560
in Europe to get it done there and then

1001
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,200
we hope in America and all around the

1002
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,020
world so it will help to make the

1003
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,880
internet a safe place and not because

1004
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,520
all hackers are

1005
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,920
criminals no criminals are criminals and

1006
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,619
hackers are the good guys in my uh

1007
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,859
humble opinion that is

1008
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:43,800
oh yeah I think yeah uh was that it's

1009
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,260
very easy three points so do it quickly

1010
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,079
do it once and Report it's it's don't

1011
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,460
quit it doesn't mean the hack quickly

1012
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,099
but you I don't do break anything why

1013
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,300
did you don't do it uh uh about personal

1014
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,560
uh

1015
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,920
uh over exposure proof and I just cannot

1016
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,000
say I think the English term for that

1017
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,640
but I think it's very uh advantage to

1018
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,079
the governments for the other side it's

1019
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,960
like if you just show it you don't break

1020
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,880
anything and you don't download data or

1021
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,099
from others so when you just prove your

1022
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,260
point you don't download all the

1023
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,720
customers data just you proved as a

1024
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,980
vulnerability and that's enough and then

1025
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,000
government said yeah

1026
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,300
prosecute yeah execute yeah my English

1027
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,359
is not awake yet I think yeah so again

1028
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,920
other things for the key representation

1029
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,319
is very useful and let's see if there

1030
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,020
any other great questions there

1031
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,760
so far

1032
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,099
I have I think we answered most of the

1033
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:46,020
questions so it's 10 minutes almost to

1034
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,579
the next presentation

1035
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,640
at Allah thank you so much I think we

1036
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,800
can do a slow uh site uh promotion there

1037
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,540
are hacker festivals like in the

1038
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,280
Netherlands we have every four years one

1039
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
that's differently cold I don't

1040
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,940
understand the logic behind it but it's

1041
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,420
the Dutch this year is the MCH may

1042
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,900
contain hackers uh

1043
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:14,900
22.org so 20 MTH I think 22.org 20

1044
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,700
22.2022.org yeah yeah so I had the first

1045
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,040
one in July after will be there I will

1046
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,960
be there with an owas Village

1047
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,079
so uh let's see if there's not much but

1048
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,500
there's still some tickets available

1049
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,859
guys so I let's say uh yeah we do

1050
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:33,540
security digital security and we have to

1051
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,640
join forces and yes it's about right

1052
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,740
secure code or right secure applications

1053
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,780
and of course you have to know to break

1054
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,760
them so there's only just security thank

1055
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,500

1056
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,660
