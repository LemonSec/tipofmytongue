1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,440
good morning everybody and welcome to OS

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,940
websec EU 2022 my name is Amit and I am

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,460
going to be your moderator today

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,260
um and we are having a very very

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,300
interesting topic from Adrian who is

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,720
going to be our speaker uh about oasp's

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
open application security and curriculum

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,080
project

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,400
um this is actually a very very

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,920
interesting topic because one of the

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,599
major challenges that we see in the

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,320
market today is a lack of knowledge of

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,780
um and and skills for for security

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,640
sector

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,820
um you know everybody knows that the

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,340
people who are working in security and

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,860
the people who they are serving to is is

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,260
having a very different kind of ratio we

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,379
have seen mostly one is to ten two one

20
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,719
is 200 when it comes to security versus

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,680
developer or devsecops Engineers

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,420
um and today we have Adrian who is going

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,820
to talk about

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,200
an initiative from ovas on how we can

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,260
formalize and also make it open in terms

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,479
of a security curriculum which can be

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,000
helpful not only to individuals or

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,619
people who are enthusiastic about

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,560
security but also to organizations who

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,900
want to adopt security education as a

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,180
part of their culture and also to to

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,460
make more security Champions within the

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,320
team

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,540
Adrian is the director of cyber security

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,200
and networking research group at Angela

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,420
Ruskin University and he has been

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,880
associated with OAS for quite a long

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,939
time and and I think I'll hand it over

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,400
to Adrian to talk more about himself as

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
well as for the project thank you Adrian

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,880
okay thank you Amit

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,040
uh good uh good morning or good

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,659
afternoon to everyone depending on which

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,479
part of the world you're dialed in from

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,420
um my name is Adrian Winkles

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,299
um and I'm the current project leader

47
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,399
for the oasp open application security

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,360
curriculum project

49
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,098
remember me a second I want to figure

50
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,340
out

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,140
proper Mouse controls

52
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,319
um and you can reach me on either the OS

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,379
or my work email addresses so just some

54
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,520
background

55
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,739
um information uh I am the director of

56
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,060
the cyber security and networking

57
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,220
research group and a security researcher

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,379
at angular Ruskin University and I've

59
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,900
been involved for both West for about uh

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,340
10 years

61
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,980
um I'm the Cambridge chapter leader in

62
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,180
the UK

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,700
um I'm a European board member and I'm

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
chair of the OS education committee and

65
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,280
my research background

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,400
it's quite diverse in terms of many

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,440
aspects of security some of the

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,599
application security threat intelligence

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,239
cyber crime investigation developing

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
virtual crime scene

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,099
incident security incident simulations

72
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,739
and I've worked on a number of horizon

73
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,040
2020 and other related European projects

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,739
to do a security as well

75
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,400
so on the starting point if we I like to

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,980
think that security is like a stack of

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,080
Swiss cheese

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,220
um for those of you that don't know what

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,840
swiss cheese is if you think of things

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,239
like air mental where you have holes in

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,860
it

82
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,620
um so no one security solution

83
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,060
covers everything

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,280
so you have to layer

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,200
swiss cheese on top of each other to

86
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,599
cover all the holes

87
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,500
um

88
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,099
education's a bit like this as well

89
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,819
um we really do

90
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,959
cover some aspects of a horrible word

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,080
cyber in some ways but in others we

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,599
don't an application security is is one

93
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,340
of those areas so

94
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,220
where are the problems

95
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,159
it's not just about infrastructure it's

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,620
not just about the infrastructure layers

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,459
um

98
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,920
it's not just about protecting the

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,500
operator system

100
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,080
it's not just about what's known in

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,360
terms of vulnerabilities and it's not

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,760
just about what's not known I.E zero

103
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,440
days

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
some of it yes is about

105
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,840
how we use what we've got

106
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,100
and so it's operating in regimes of poor

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,340
cyber hygiene educating users but very

108
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,960
often

109
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,139
in a lot of traditional cyber security

110
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,199
setups we've left something out and what

111
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,479
is the thing we've left out it's the

112
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,000
application or the application should I

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
say

114
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,440
so don't just take my word for it I mean

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,419
it shouldn't cover news to anyone

116
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,300
particularly but Gartner say

117
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,020
um 75 of security breaches happen at the

118
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,440
application

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,500
um but obviously over 70 of security

120
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,840
vulnerabilities exist at the application

121
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,060
layer not the network layer

122
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,160
they're also going to say

123
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,340
if only 50 of software vulnerabilities

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,759
were removed prior to production costs

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,280
could be reduced by 75 percent

126
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,860
this is our devops shift left argument

127
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,259
for those that

128
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,220
um

129
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,900
consider such things

130
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,180
and it isn't just Gartner iguanas act

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,340
and this the National Institutes of

132
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,400
standards and Technology say 92 percent

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,680
of reported vulnerabilities are now in

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,100
the applications not in the networks

135
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,460
so from a security point of view

136
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,400
applications are the new Panacea

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
it's not

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,020
um and but does

139
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,080
what we do in terms of teaching

140
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,699
graduates

141
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,820
we are getting Developers

142
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,580
do we build this in do we actually teach

143
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,460
people application security and if we do

144
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,280
do we do it properly

145
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,020
and this is also work I'm going to say

146
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,440
the cost of fixing a bug in the field

147
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
is approximately per application thirty

148
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,259
thousand dollars

149
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,840
compared to five thousand dollars if you

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
fix it during coding if you did if you

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,280
fix it earlier in the software

152
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,319
development life cycle again back to our

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,880
shift lifter

154
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,199
in other words

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,720
knowing how to fix

156
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,000
vulnerabilities in the software

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,020
development process is key to

158
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,900
achieving application security

159
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,479
yes we talked about the end devices we

160
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,580
took in my earlier talk I talked I

161
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,319
talked about web application firewalls

162
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,960
and that will help some but it is still

163
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,060
a sticky plaster

164
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,740
if you do things right you build out

165
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,960
vulnerabilities out of your applications

166
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,940
before they hit a production environment

167
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,880
so

168
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,699
going back to some of those statistics

169
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,039
we can start to see how many

170
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,680
vulnerabilities are application related

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
so you you can get to some of the

172
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,360
figures by starting to add up

173
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,539
server applications 36 non-server

174
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,400
applications 41 percent

175
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,740
in the operating system 15 and you still

176
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,840
understand it it becomes the remaining

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,259
sort of eight percent are the network

178
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,120
the hardware

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,340
everything else is

180
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,259
software related I'm including the

181
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,819
operating system in that but that

182
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,180
essentially is still software so we're

183
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,180
still looking at a very large part of a

184
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,000
problem now being the application if you

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
like this is the new front line in our

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,979
war

187
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,099
for achieving security so it is

188
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:05,120
applications are the big issue

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,620
and the trend that Trends only going to

190
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,720
continue the trend is towards more

191
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,639
vulnerabilities in the software this

192
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,160
could be at the center level it can be

193
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,639
mobile applications it can be a

194
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,340
concentrating Hub it could be the server

195
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,379
back end

196
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,039
the end point is

197
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,360
application security is now

198
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,860
and would probably is we tend to build

199
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,880
in

200
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,099
vulnerabilities by using unsafe

201
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,380
libraries unsafe development

202
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,419
environments and of course we know from

203
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,219
history this can be open source or

204
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,679
proprietary

205
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,640
um

206
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,100
we've all seen

207
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,120
um

208
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,019
Heartbleed we've seen struts you've seen

209
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,500
xcode ghost

210
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,200
we've seen the solar wind example of

211
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
Supply chains

212
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
and numerous other countries examples in

213
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
the past 12 months but the point is we

214
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
are building them into applications in

215
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
some cases by unprofessional practice or

216
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,920
not having enough due diligence so

217
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,980
understanding those aspects attacks of

218
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,500
application security are essential for

219
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,660
anyone involved in application

220
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,720
development and

221
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,100
Security Professionals

222
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,620
so another way of looking at it

223
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,500
perhaps An Inconvenient Truth

224
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,060
is that

225
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,180
we only see the tip of the iceberg

226
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,519
two weeks pen testing for the

227
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,260
application is just the tip of the

228
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,620
iceberg there are everything else that's

229
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,140
under the water

230
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
um

231
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,279
security errors business logic flaws

232
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,820
code floors are all hidden

233
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,000
uh the end user the the end purchasing

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,620
organization of this of the software

235
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,480
used or the in-house or external

236
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
whichever way you look at it

237
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,899
um is generally using only C's the front

238
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,519
end of the application they don't see

239
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,959
everything that goes on underneath

240
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,820
they're not involved in the development

241
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,640
perhaps don't care less about actual

242
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
development to use the product

243
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,820
but from an I.T professional point of

244
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,519
view we have to understand that we are

245
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,600
building in the problems

246
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,680
foreign

247
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,080
so

248
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,300
why do these application vulnerabilities

249
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,839
occur

250
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,760
two viewpoints

251
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,180
um

252
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,160
Security Professionals don't know the

253
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,420
applications

254
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,240
still holds to a certain extent to this

255
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
day that a lot of security people

256
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
perhaps have come from an infrastructure

257
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,940
background

258
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,740
so they don't might not know how

259
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,440
applications supposed to work

260
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
um

261
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,959
they may deploy the protective Solutions

262
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,180
they've purchased

263
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,940
um but are they protecting what needs to

264
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,480
be protected and if it's the application

265
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
if you've got a floor in the actual way

266
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,060
the application works built in a

267
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,519
vulnerability

268
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,399
it's very hard using other layers of

269
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,260
sticky plaster come back to our layers

270
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,120
of Swiss cheese to actually fix the

271
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
problem

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,600
we also have

273
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,800
the same point of view from

274
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,480
application Developers

275
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,320
QA professionals don't know Securities

276
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,279
um

277
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,079
might be able to build great software

278
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,600
but if they have no

279
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,720
inkling of what security involves

280
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,519
it might be using standard libraries

281
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,720
they might not be checking those

282
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,440
libraries they might be using reusing as

283
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,200
a vulnerable code

284
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
um and if they're not checking so we got

285
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,420
two sides with security Gap

286
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,540
we've got a Chasm that we need to cross

287
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,820
still to this day

288
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,920
another way to think about it is is

289
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,660
weinberg's second law

290
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,820
if Builders built buildings the way

291
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,519
programs like programming

292
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,420
um

293
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,279
the first woodpecker that came along

294
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,160
would destroy civilization

295
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,980
so

296
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,600
essentially

297
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
we can be we are building in the

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,860
problems so how do we fix this

299
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,700
so

300
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,940
from a security analyst uh Security

301
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,860
operation point of view how do we fix

302
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,480
the problem what do they need to know

303
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,360
understand the data and the information

304
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,639
held in the application

305
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,279
understanding the types of users perhaps

306
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,860
half the battle

307
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,540
involve security analysts keep the

308
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,139
design phase

309
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,060
um from a developer point of view

310
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,519
embrace

311
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,220
um secure application development

312
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,779
devsecops if you like

313
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,300
um bake security into Frameworks when

314
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,740
you can

315
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,440
and remember what quality means quality

316
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,839
is not just does it work

317
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,360
security should also be a measure of

318
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,260
quality as well

319
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,760
from a QA point of view

320
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,980
security vulnerabilities should be

321
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,079
considered bugs

322
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,300
the same as functional bugs and trapped

323
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,019
in the same manner foreign

324
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,959
point of view

325
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,920
in a

326
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,579
development rollout plan

327
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,399
Factor some time in for security and

328
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,560
it's not I just mean the two weeks at

329
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,420
the end that you pen test the Black Box

330
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,300
application that is still part of your

331
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,579
testing but

332
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,579
building in security checkpoints in your

333
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,399
software development process

334
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,459
security is an added value

335
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,100
if you don't do it it might seem that

336
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,660
you're first to Market you've got the

337
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,639
application out there great tick the Box

338
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,500
brownie points

339
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,760
but

340
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,880
if it's serious floor is found

341
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,800
you're going to be paying a lot more

342
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,620
later on so for every one dollar one

343
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,160
dollar invested during development

344
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
um

345
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,860
you're going to save so much more after

346
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,660
it it'll cost you a hundred dollars

347
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,000
after release

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,199
so on

349
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,740
so

350
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,600
we have bottom-up problems we need to

351
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,139
reach a point of equilibrium between

352
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:49,800
um

353
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,060
board

354
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,459
and developer

355
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,920
developers don't have time to just to

356
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,440
test adequately if at all developers

357
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,420
don't necessarily know secure coding

358
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,880
practices

359
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,199
there's also a pressure to be first to

360
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,639
Market

361
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,699
um

362
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
and with that pressure to be first to

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,120
Market you might be using

364
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,000
untested clocks component off the shelf

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,339
um you might be borrowing libraries to

366
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,500
save time and money but have those

367
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,779
libraries being properly tested can do

368
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,320
can you use them uh with impunity

369
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,100
um

370
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,440
whilst worrying you might be building in

371
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
vulnerabilities that are going to come

372
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,980
back and bite you later on

373
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,899
so solution from a bottom-up point of

374
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,180
view

375
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,500
developers taught secure coding

376
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,760
techniques

377
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,199
testing it's not just functionality or

378
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,360
user experience but security built in

379
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,839
for the first principles

380
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,920
sanitizing third-party products and

381
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,320
libraries testing throughout the

382
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,079
software development life cycle

383
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,180
isn't just about the end Black Box pen

384
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,220
testing it is also about white box

385
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,260
testing as well so you know what you put

386
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,320
inside but you can sanitize and inspect

387
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,920
the code at various points

388
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,079
I talked about an equilibrium

389
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,760
so we've looked at it from a bottom-up

390
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,500
perspective we can also look at it from

391
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,899
a top-down perspective

392
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,600
excuse remember

393
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,399
there's always a lot of pressure to be

394
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,320
first to Market focus on product

395
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,360
features and user experience

396
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,699
but not security security needs to be up

397
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,339
there with everything else

398
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,519
so it can be about cost reduction during

399
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,620
the security risk and in some

400
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,560
organization uh security is not seen as

401
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
a boardroom priority

402
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,699
and in organizations where there's a

403
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,220
lack of a security culture especially in

404
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,899
engineering teams

405
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,160
that can spell disaster

406
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,740
so from a top-down solution it's about

407
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,940
education

408
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,360
boardroom and Senior Management need to

409
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,459
see this necessity to build Security in

410
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,500
from the start

411
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,299
presentation

412
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,859
ensure that there is someone

413
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,439
representing security

414
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,179
board level

415
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,619
aside so to be exact so someone perhaps

416
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,040
um sometimes controversially

417
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,819
separate to the it function

418
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,280
and that person should drive a security

419
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,880
culture from the top down

420
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,280
because security is everyone's problem

421
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,640
so that's the equilibrium most important

422
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,120
is to educate to build Security in build

423
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,919
it from the top down

424
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,200
and build it from the bottom up you can

425
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,820
meet in the middle and if you've

426
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,440
achieved you have to do it from both

427
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,200
ends

428
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,360
so this is what we're saying there is a

429
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,140
need for education

430
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,160
means the need for cyber education

431
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,460
anyway to end users security Wireless

432
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,059
programs cyber security is everyone's

433
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,600
responsibility

434
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,299
you need to educate developers the Next

435
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,620
Generation so you need to build

436
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,678
um

437
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,799
uh

438
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
application security into the computer

439
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,340
science script club with cyber security

440
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,400
applications specifically because this

441
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,140
is where

442
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,140
our biggest problem lies

443
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,480
um I've done some work with colleagues

444
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,240
in the in the UK academic Community

445
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,059
um BCS IC squared with a community as a

446
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,059
practice initiative making sure that

447
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,360
computer science cyber programs include

448
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,820
application security one of the reasons

449
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,580
also one of the reasons we're developing

450
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,640
the application security open framework

451
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,740
from an OS perspective is to make sure

452
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,120
because

453
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,880
we are the go-to people for the

454
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,919
community for application security so we

455
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,640
should have a

456
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,900
framework that says this is what people

457
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,280
need to know

458
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,700
and there is some work with scysc this

459
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,840
is the

460
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,460
um

461
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,960
the cyber security

462
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,940
um cyber security

463
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,380
um

464
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,299
uh professional body

465
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:25,080
Crest as well as cyborg

466
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,700
um this is the Cyber

467
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,000
um body of knowledge uh also includes

468
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,100
some work on application security

469
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,900
probably not enough but a starting point

470
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,299
so the Next Generation there are some

471
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,160
approaches we need to adopt but we need

472
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,520
an overall arching

473
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
and the other question is what about the

474
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,299
other existing generation

475
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,160
those people that

476
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,660
uh there's a lot of people that have

477
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,120
come in to software development that

478
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,160
maybe haven't followed traditional

479
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,799
academic routes have come in

480
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,720
um either self-taught taught by their

481
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,340
organizations

482
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,740
um they may be very very good coders but

483
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,440
do they know application security some

484
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,059
might

485
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,460
um so it isn't just about training

486
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,100
people once it's about a continuing

487
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,720
education program

488
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,780
so secure coding programs workshops

489
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,299
revision follow-up uh what's the old

490
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,860
adage I always say a dog isn't just for

491
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,039
Christmas

492
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,440
so there's a need for Education this is

493
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
what we're trying to establish

494
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,820
we need security testing throughout the

495
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,500
software development life cycle not just

496
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,520
at the end

497
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,160
we have things like the OS testing guide

498
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,980
we have the asvs the application

499
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,580
security verification system

500
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,080
um

501
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,480
the board need to educate board members

502
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,240
to build security from the start as a

503
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,320
business benefit

504
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,480
with the adage that security is

505
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,360
everyone's responsibility

506
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,100
so

507
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,320
part of when this

508
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,780
part of ogos main purpose is to be the

509
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,940
thriving Global community that drives

510
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,580
visibility and evolution in the Safety

511
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,640
and Security of the world software

512
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,039
so part of that commission is to educate

513
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,200
not just a current generation developers

514
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
or Information Security Professionals

515
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
but the Next Generation

516
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,919
particularly in acknowledging the skill

517
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,980
shortage in the security sector

518
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,020
now a common problem with many security

519
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,179
education programs or even traditional

520
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,220
computer science programs is they don't

521
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,440
necessarily address application security

522
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,299
adequately

523
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:38,220
yes most will mention the OS top 10.

524
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,700
which is a start don't you but really

525
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,059
that's not enough we need to do more

526
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,360
um so in the UK IC squared and the BCS

527
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,940
which is which could be the society

528
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,600
worked on an initiative pre-coded to

529
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,520
embed secure

530
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,860
security firmly within the computer

531
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,200
science scripting with an emphasis on

532
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,780
secure so here coding techniques and

533
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,940
also obviously through minor involvement

534
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,820
Champion that initiative as well

535
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,059
so part of this project is an

536
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,400
opportunity to coordinate the expertise

537
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,220
the projects interest parties and these

538
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,080
types of pedagogic programs initiatives

539
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
to formulate an educational strategy

540
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
that meets the air level expectations

541
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,440
required by industry

542
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,640
um so developing an educational strategy

543
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,919
not just for

544
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,679
tertiary or secondary education

545
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,200
but also for industry as well so this

546
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,820
isn't just

547
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,559
um a

548
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,620
what do you embed in a degree program

549
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,860
but also taking a more

550
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,880
um

551
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,700
holistic view about

552
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,860
what commercial training providers

553
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,840
provide as well

554
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,940
um and we'll look at some goals about

555
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,860
what we're going to do so yeah I'm

556
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,299
interested from an undergraduate and a

557
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,039
postgraduate level but also I'm

558
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
interested from an apprenticeship point

559
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,820
of view what are the skills that people

560
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,799
are being taught

561
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,539
that are in the industry what do people

562
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,580
know in Industry what do people need to

563
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,919
know what should what should we be

564
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,140
re-educating as well so it isn't just

565
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,960
about traditional Academia it's also

566
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,059
about commercial as well

567
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,200
so

568
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,240
what next

569
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,179
what aspects of application similarity

570
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,000
and skills does industry need

571
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
what problems relating to application

572
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,860
Securities is the next generation of

573
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,480
graduate software developers computer

574
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,240
scientists or security analysts need to

575
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
solve so as part of that we really need

576
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,179
a core set of learning objectives

577
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,360
probably initially for BSC or MSC

578
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,460
level application security curricular

579
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,919
but also for other educational and

580
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,140
training providers

581
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,320
part of that in some Works than this as

582
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,100
well

583
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,220
um is linking what OS projects are

584
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,280
useful to help shape and to pour a

585
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,799
curriculum application security so it

586
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,600
isn't just enough to say this is what

587
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,580
you need to learn

588
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,280
and this is what your key

589
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,260
um

590
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,539
flags are that you need to influence

591
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,280
your program it's also about how can you

592
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,480
achieve that

593
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,659
foreign

594
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,020
by which Regional or local deliveries of

595
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,120
the of a curriculum could be supported

596
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,720
by the iOS Community oh I supported on

597
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
educational validation panels critical

598
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,100
friends on multiple design guest

599
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,799
lectures training academics even perhaps

600
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,280
but ensuring that they're all

601
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,460
involved it may be having a

602
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,219
um

603
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,039
I live a list of uh approved training

604
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,059
providers that are known and have been

605
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,360
accredited almost to provide

606
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,980
um the proper level of app set training

607
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,900
so

608
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,559
proposal potential bid initiative would

609
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,600
be establish a corset of learning

610
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,799
objectives for an application

611
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,559
description that defines the educational

612
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,080
requirements

613
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,020
for Academia and Industry

614
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,539
Again part of that is a gap analysis of

615
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,279
existing and missing

616
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,440
curricular

617
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,179
um and those learning requirements

618
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,820
outlined by industry and that's achieved

619
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,140
through liaison with industry

620
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,659
professionals and state-of-the-art

621
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,799
literature

622
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,159
a second objective is to appraise the

623
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,080
state of art of application security

624
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,400
teaching

625
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,620
and

626
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,020
resources available and determine the

627
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,059
gaps of non-coverage that may begin

628
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,120
another Gap analysis what existing and

629
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,159
missing teaching resources are this

630
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,140
could be through Discovery workshops

631
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,919
industry links we know there are some

632
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,620
good

633
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,640
industry-leading projects out there that

634
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,159
we have as of projects

635
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,140
we know we have

636
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,140
um

637
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,059
things like Beyond work with Juice Shop

638
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,880
we have the previous academic work cost

639
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,140
us

640
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,039
um

641
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,419
we have

642
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,419
um

643
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,559
some of the other other projects in

644
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,480
between that develop

645
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,779
broken web apps that can test

646
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,419
uh we've had a lot of work around

647
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:43,320
um

648
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,080
security uh application security

649
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
resources

650
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,980
um

651
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,440
the OS top 10 the cheat sheets all of

652
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,159
that

653
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,659
well-known

654
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,100
but this is the stuff that we're missing

655
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,600
it's stuff other people have developed

656
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,200
that isn't known in the community

657
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,020
objective three would be to recommend an

658
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,600
application security open curricular

659
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,360
so this is to produce and disseminate a

660
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,640
learning skills framework to support the

661
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,779
industry and the problems they face

662
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,820
developing

663
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,039
software developers computer scientists

664
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,919
security analysts

665
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,140
incorporating desktopocs this would be

666
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,940
an open framework

667
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,700
that could be used at all levels as part

668
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,919
of a

669
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,760
certification level for training

670
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,240
requirements for example again include

671
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,100
key influences

672
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,679
C cybuck ISC squared ACM IEEE

673
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:41,940
um

674
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,120
industry leading organizations as well

675
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,059
foreign

676
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,740
[Music]

677
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,360
pull together

678
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,960
OS expertise projects dedicated

679
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,700
volunteers to engage in these types of

680
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,799
education programs and initiatives

681
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,539
developed as part of an educational

682
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,820
strategy for undergraduate and

683
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,980
postgraduate students

684
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,260
most importantly map projects to

685
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,000
learning objectives

686
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
so

687
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,279
what we don't know as an organization is

688
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,320
what

689
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,200
is being taught in some of our regional

690
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,240
National universities our training

691
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,240
providers we don't know

692
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,179
um how far the absent message is getting

693
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,539
out there

694
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,059
um so part of that is also understanding

695
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,539
who is speaking to who who

696
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:44,400
may represent do we have a named uh or a

697
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,360
supporter in each tertiary College each

698
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,240
University that's teaching

699
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,880
cyber Security Programs there's teaching

700
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,380
aspects of software development in their

701
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,740
pure science programs do training

702
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,279
providers

703
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,460
take on board the appsec message or are

704
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,919
people using

705
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,799
um the appsec materials well but don't

706
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
acknowledge them

707
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,020
so some coordination

708
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,880
so

709
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,419
anyone remember this from 2015 this

710
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,860
always impressed me the the quick

711
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,039
developers guide the infographic I

712
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,419
believe there's a new version or

713
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,159
something similar to this which is great

714
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,720
but

715
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,940
developing this from an educational

716
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,120
framework point of view

717
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,679
because this is where I think we're

718
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,000
missing a trip

719
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,799
so

720
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,320
the beneficiaries how is this going to

721
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,480
help people

722
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,700
um any Global industrial organization of

723
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,159
internet-facing applications

724
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,000
um

725
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,740
can through an open curricula that's

726
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,840
been shaped by industry achieved some

727
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,100
learning objectives and application

728
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,100
security Global academic and specialist

729
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,440
training authorities can benefit from

730
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,899
Frameworks descent some Frameworks

731
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,419
developed specifically to address

732
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,880
um application security requirements

733
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,740
International professional policy

734
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,100
members uh benefit from focused

735
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
accreditation and certification programs

736
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,140
International populations benefit

737
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,700
through better protection of critical

738
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,399
infrastructure and an internet enabled

739
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,659
Technologies

740
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,460
and from International economic

741
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,860
prospects UK and internationally benefit

742
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,940
from an increase in available skilled

743
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,159
importance so

744
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,539
as an intended impact

745
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,679
we train

746
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,779
globally I.T Security Professionals

747
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,299
software developers to an industry

748
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,240
relevant standard to ensure developing

749
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,080
skills and future and again protecting

750
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,740
its future applications security threats

751
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,799
um

752
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,600
any Global industrial organization

753
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,580
facing with internet-facing applications

754
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,559
will have developers trained

755
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,539
they'll develop those applications with

756
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,700
security at the heart

757
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,580
and not as an afterthought

758
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,220
and again uh specialist training

759
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,100
providers academic institutions can

760
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
provide

761
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,720
new degrees diplomas bespoke training

762
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,700
programs using an internationally

763
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,679
endorsed curriculum framework

764
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,580
International professional bodies will

765
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,700
have a internationally supported

766
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,100
and respected skill both for application

767
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,179
security

768
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,700
uh this will form a more focused

769
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,159
accreditation and certification

770
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,200
provision for

771
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,020
institution members

772
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,600
um it increases the overall skill set of

773
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Security Professionals

774
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,740
um and software developers International

775
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,260
internationally

776
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,480
it improves the workforce the critical

777
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,760
infrastructure and the internet of a

778
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,440
Technologies and applications so they're

779
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,960
better protected

780
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,440
and again

781
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,760
by improving the skill sets of I.T

782
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,080
Security Professionals and software

783
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,299
Developers

784
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,700
overall nation states employment benefit

785
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,919
from

786
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,980
increased so next steps we need to

787
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,779
bolster the education committee we need

788
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,640
a bit of a reboot

789
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,980
um but we need to understand better what

790
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,720
is being provided in educational

791
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
settings and what oh rasps relationship

792
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,820
to them one of the things I intend to do

793
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,640
is ask the OS staff team to so we can

794
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,860
develop a database of application

795
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,659
security providers

796
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,000
Social Security trainers a data creative

797
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,580
academic supporters and contacts and a

798
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,000
mechanism to keep them up to date

799
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,740
um a database of the project leads

800
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,440
that's a supporting academic curriculums

801
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,059
modules products as well as training

802
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,020
providers

803
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,779
and database of chapter leaders who they

804
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,299
support in terms of academic programs or

805
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,740
offer talks to

806
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,260
the students

807
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,480
so what am I trying to do there's an

808
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,019
intended outline as a proposal

809
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,360
we've had some talks with one or two

810
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
possible funders

811
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,479
we have

812
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,140
um

813
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,779
there's been some background work on

814
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,519
identifying some of the learning key

815
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,380
skills and objectives through some of

816
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,760
the work that's been done with projects

817
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,279
like atheist asvs

818
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,980
um that has a lot of key building blocks

819
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,840
still doesn't replace the Gap analysis

820
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,980
from everything else I talked about but

821
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,799
that is a key Building Stone

822
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,360
um

823
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,580
looking at who we should be asking

824
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,620
online questionnaire platforms to use

825
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,919
what questions should we be asking

826
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,620
um the target audience the

827
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,460
OS leaders lists Community lists uh

828
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,980
slack channels making sure we reach out

829
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,620
to all chapters How do we reach trainers

830
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,080
and other universities that are using OS

831
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,199
content how do we know the other

832
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,839
training providers

833
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:13,859
um

834
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,280
colleges are using OS content how do we

835
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,040
know it's being built into curriculums

836
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,820
um

837
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,800
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence to

838
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,859
say that the OS top 10 features and the

839
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,199
fact that the OS top 10 is featured in

840
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,780
things like PCI DSS

841
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,219
um has always been a major drawing point

842
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,599
so if you need to know that standard

843
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,260
then you also need to know uh of 10

844
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,239
features in some of the UK stuff in

845
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,379
terms of

846
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,000
um

847
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,699
cyber Essentials uh but that's a

848
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,219
typically at its lowest level a self

849
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,320
certification tick box

850
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,899
um and then most importantly how do you

851
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:55,699
map OS projects to objectives

852
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,800
okay I think I'm sort of coming to my

853
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,140
you know my 40 45 minutes

854
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,240
um if you need to get hold of me there's

855
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,820
my Twitter feed there's my

856
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,880
um

857
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,940
uh OS the email address please do drop

858
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,260
me a line

859
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,000
um one Keen for people to be involved in

860
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,900
the education and get a reboot going and

861
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,579
also people involved want to get

862
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,760
involved in the project or on Commit

863
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,619
um I'm hoping that I will have more time

864
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,460
after coming out a period of illness

865
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,260
um yeah

866
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,960
questions please

867
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,540
okay thank you Adrian that was a very

868
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,700
very interesting uh talk

869
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
um but there are a couple of uh things

870
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,560
that is crossing my mind

871
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,720
um one of them is

872
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,780
so so what about the commercial trainers

873
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,760
of course it's not only for academics

874
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,740
but also

875
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,240
um from commercial perspective what are

876
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,500
your thoughts on that

877
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,119
so

878
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,720
we're developing an open curricula

879
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,180
um yeah from for my buyer's point of

880
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,480
view I I'm an academic so my first I

881
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,280
linked into the day job

882
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,380
um but it's wider than that because

883
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,380
those skills that that curriculum is

884
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,140
open it can be applied to whatever uh

885
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,220
level and program you want to adapt so

886
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,320
um if somebody wanted to offer an

887
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,060
application introduction to application

888
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,220
security program they could take aspects

889
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,859
of an open curricular and use that the

890
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,460
ideas is to is to have those key sets of

891
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,000
learning objectives those key

892
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,280
um skills that you need to learn and

893
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,619
they're available as a

894
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,260
open curriculum that people can take

895
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,740
bits out of to use as they want

896
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,140
yes there's opportunities we can do to

897
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,760
set up certification that sort of thing

898
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,920
but with an open curriculum

899
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,520
um

900
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,740
our idea because we were an open source

901
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,320
organization so everything that we

902
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,060
deliver

903
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,160
um apart from conferences

904
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,099
um is free at the point of delivery so

905
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,960
we can't charge people for it quickly

906
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,540
but we want to spread the message wider

907
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,099
so that's there for training before us

908
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,859
to use it isn't just for

909
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,240
um you've got to start something and the

910
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,859
other side of that argument is you've

911
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,079
got to start somewhere you've got to use

912
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,520
yeah the security curriculum

913
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,720
um

914
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,359
a lot of our computer scientists

915
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,900
go through formal education programs as

916
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,420
I said earlier in my presentation

917
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,820
there's a whole community of developers

918
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,339
that never had any formal education

919
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,220
that have learned themselves uh or maybe

920
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,140
taught by the organization have maybe

921
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,000
come into software development from

922
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,680
another route or have come into a

923
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,440
security analysts for another route

924
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,339
there's a lot there's a lot of security

925
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,980
analysts of that are on the sort of

926
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,820
human security side as psychologists so

927
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,780
a lot of them won't have had any form so

928
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,079
you need methods and specialist training

929
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,880
providers that can deliver that to

930
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,980
organizations

931
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,680
um it isn't always about degree programs

932
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,940
I'm going to be first to say that

933
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,320
because

934
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,859
um

935
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,960
there's a lot of formal time involved

936
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,460
with personal investment and I thought

937
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,839
but

938
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,780
then there are specialist trainers that

939
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,760
will deliver those sort of programs that

940
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,200
can pick up

941
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,420
because even software developers should

942
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,820
be going to going regular Tony because

943
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,400
the same

944
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,500
from a very crude point of view

945
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,560
um

946
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,000
software development programming

947
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,760
languages change flavors change and you

948
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,320
need to re-educate yourself and

949
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,140
redevelop your knowledge in a

950
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,599
um you move from C to C plus plus or you

951
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,359
move from C plus plus C sharp or uh you

952
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,579
suddenly move on to

953
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:54,359
um

954
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,320
uh Java or oh whatever yeah we'll move

955
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,700
it to python

956
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,820
um or Ruby on Rails or whatever

957
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,820
um yeah people need redeveloping so it

958
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,740
isn't just it isn't just about Academia

959
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,140
it's wider I'm just putting myself to

960
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,540
one part because it that I have to start

961
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,339
somewhere but

962
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,420
it's it's it's it has a wider Focus

963
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,000
yep I completely agree and I can vote

964
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,579
for myself that when back in those days

965
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,200
when I started there was there was no

966
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,060
curriculum available right it was the ad

967
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,859
hoc kind of learning

968
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,500
um and an intriguing topics

969
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,920
um and yes of course uh of uh was one of

970
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,480
uh the major uh portals uh in terms of

971
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,980
information because there were so many

972
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,260
collaborating towards it okay

973
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,119
um so there is another question here and

974
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,099
I think I completely agree as well so in

975
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,660
your perspective

976
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,880
um is it enough to just hack an

977
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,400
application or do you think going

978
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,579
through an exercise on let's say how an

979
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,160
attack works or how an application works

980
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,200
or maybe building an application which

981
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,079
is vulnerable in nature can help so as a

982
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,579
student what do you think is more

983
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,339
beneficial from learning perspective

984
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,500
both

985
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,079
um so okay so if I was wearing my

986
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,520
Educators hat

987
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,180
um

988
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,280
first and foremost I'll say

989
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm not specifically a software

990
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,680
developer I can hack some code it's not

991
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,020
particularly wonderful but I I would

992
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,200
write glue where to do jobs that I need

993
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,700
to do

994
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,160
um but what I would say from an

995
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,560
educational perspective is

996
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,680
um both being able to do

997
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,260
black box and white box

998
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,960
give you the all-round skills you need

999
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
so for an educational perspective what I

1000
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,599
would get students to do is

1001
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,599
build your own application

1002
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,680
um

1003
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,500
do a Security review at each stage of

1004
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,640
that

1005
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,099
um software development life cycle and

1006
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,079
yes and then you do the black box at the

1007
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,280
end or you get somebody else the Black

1008
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,400
Box test your application so you swap

1009
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,839
um so two heads are always better than

1010
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,540
one because you know your code but

1011
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,280
you're not always the best person to

1012
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,560
judge your own code because you don't

1013
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,380
always spot your own mistakes so from

1014
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,240
both perspectives somebody else looking

1015
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,560
at your code you looking at your own

1016
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,260
code you testing your own code someone

1017
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,300
else testing your code so it's almost

1018
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,140
like

1019
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,660
I know an ideal situation if you're

1020
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,000
developing two students develop two of

1021
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,440
their applications you swap the

1022
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,619
applications and you test each other's

1023
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,619
um you can so both sets of skills are

1024
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,700
needed

1025
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,280
to Security Professionals need to

1026
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,079
understand code

1027
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,579
um if they can see the code and look at

1028
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:45,660
it

1029
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,339
um

1030
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,540
the developers will understand the code

1031
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,619
better but they might not understand

1032
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,180
security but they both need to come

1033
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,160
together to cross that chasm

1034
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,619
yep yeah I completely agree on that

1035
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,200
aspect as well maybe we can form some

1036
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,660
kind of blue team or or red team kind of

1037
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,359
exercises by the end of semesters yep

1038
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,920
exactly that that's the sort of thing

1039
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,240
that's I mean we tend to teach

1040
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,280
a lot of red team

1041
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,339
and that's that's brilliant some of that

1042
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,020
is absolutely

1043
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,140
spot on but it isn't the red team stuff

1044
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,820
tends to be

1045
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,980
the end pen test so you've got the

1046
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,960
application it's broken you find the

1047
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,420
vulnerabilities and you tell people his

1048
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,180
vulnerability go fix but

1049
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,380
if you don't understand how the

1050
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,720
vulnerability could be fixed which is

1051
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,460
where the blue team come in have you

1052
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,200
check the shared libraries have you

1053
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,060
checked

1054
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,380
um

1055
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,320
what tools could be built into these

1056
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,700
layers of Swiss cheese that I talked

1057
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,079
about for your critical infrastructure

1058
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,079
so it has the WAFF picked something up

1059
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,960
um have you I mean another project that

1060
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,000
we used to run in I suppose um the app

1061
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,740
center project which was built about

1062
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,200
intrusion detection monitoring points

1063
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,960
within the software to detect the types

1064
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
of attacks that might be going in so if

1065
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,280
you ever had a

1066
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,940
um

1067
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,579
some form of user interface

1068
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,040
typically I don't cross cross either

1069
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,740
cross side scripts and if you're putting

1070
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,900
text in somewhere or SQL type injection

1071
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,180
anywhere where there is any direct text

1072
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,220
entry can you detect the type of

1073
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,260
intrusion detect that that's their

1074
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,060
classic which we want but also

1075
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,280
manipulation of session IDs and all that

1076
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,200
all those sort of things can your

1077
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,759
software flag that if it happens

1078
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,339
there's that type of education I don't

1079
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:36,480
think we do

1080
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,940
very well either

1081
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,880
um because the focus is in security

1082
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,900
yeah

1083
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,020
okay and that's a good one as well

1084
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,099
um so there are a couple of more

1085
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,740
questions related to

1086
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,359
um something like what are the subjects

1087
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,119
that you see in the curriculum or what

1088
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,700
is a typical day for you uh like working

1089
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,540
in absec

1090
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,859
so what do I see the subjects

1091
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:08,099
uh as as many general principles as

1092
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,359
possible

1093
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,940
um I mean if you're talking about a sort

1094
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,500
of generic student

1095
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,740
program I think general principles about

1096
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,060
validating sanitizing input uh how not

1097
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,220
hard coding

1098
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,859
um particularly cryptographic

1099
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:28,619
um in into your code well you put yep

1100
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:30,119
and comics and

1101
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,540
um those general rules of housekeeping

1102
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,700
um and knowing how

1103
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,200
if you don't then what the effects of

1104
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,940
that are and we've got a lot of good

1105
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,520
tools that help education establishments

1106
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,859
but we've no idea how well they're being

1107
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,960
used

1108
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,560
now I know in some of my degree programs

1109
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,440
I support people use Juice Shop we use

1110
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,540
security Shepherd we used to use

1111
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,400
academic

1112
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,040
um we've used web goats

1113
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,060
or brilliant tools they all do a job

1114
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,560
um I've used uh dvwa damn vulnerable web

1115
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,760
app

1116
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,920
um we there was another project

1117
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,579
um

1118
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,579
the bwa which is a broken web app which

1119
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,859
is a VM

1120
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:17,940
um

1121
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,040
but there are probably a lot more

1122
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,079
yep and are there other courses

1123
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,180
revolving around this which which is

1124
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,640
related to academics for example as you

1125
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,200
mentioned like cryptography is one of

1126
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,720
them uh are there others that that um

1127
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
that you think can be proposed to the

1128
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,020
British Academy

1129
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,500
I mean

1130
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,440
um I mean we introduced particularly

1131
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,480
um web application development web

1132
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,079
application security as to specific

1133
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,560
um but it needs to be wider that that's

1134
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,540
um turns on depends on the focus of the

1135
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,579
programs you're providing

1136
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:54,480
um

1137
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,540
but that whole application security

1138
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,280
program

1139
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,040
um there needs to be for those that are

1140
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,500
probably going into cyber security

1141
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,540
management they need to be aware of

1142
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,380
those issues not necessarily the or the

1143
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,319
coding I suppose but what makes an

1144
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,940
appsec program

1145
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,579
all right what is what is devsecops it's

1146
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,079
a good starting button shift left and

1147
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,359
all that all that sort of speaking if

1148
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,500
you're going to be doing any sort of

1149
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,180
engineering type program that needs to

1150
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,900
be high high on the agenda so again one

1151
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,060
of the things that may need to evolve is

1152
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,800
targeted learning objectives for

1153
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,520
different sectors for different parts of

1154
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,140
um that education program

1155
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,180
and do you see any kind of reluctance

1156
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,520
from the institutions do they see the

1157
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,960
need of security as a part of their

1158
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,099
curriculum

1159
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:50,940
yeah I mean if I can only say from a UK

1160
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,920
perspective I guess it's from a U.S and

1161
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,579
international sort of if your program is

1162
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,980
validated by any professional body

1163
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,740
so in in the UK

1164
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,500
um from a generic computer science point

1165
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,540
of view it'll probably be validated by

1166
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,460
the BCS or the IET

1167
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,560
um for more International perspective

1168
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,800
IEEE ACM

1169
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,079
ISC squared also do some accreditation I

1170
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,440
believe and more importantly the

1171
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,579
um

1172
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,300
scisek the new uh information uh cyber

1173
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,160
security

1174
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,880
um chartered Institute for the UK

1175
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,540
um has part of its initiative uh

1176
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,000
also being forthriting pursuing the

1177
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,640
what's called cyborg which is the Cyber

1178
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,920
body of knowledge uh which is a starting

1179
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,319
point which it sets out so you need from

1180
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,180
a student point of view and this applies

1181
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,319
to

1182
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,480
um training performers as well who will

1183
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,940
have training delegates

1184
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,859
um what is it they're going to learn

1185
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,680
what what how do I know what you're

1186
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,839
teaching me is going to be relevant to

1187
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,900
something what are you what do you

1188
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,560
targeting your training against

1189
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,060
um and that that's part of what we're

1190
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,359
missing we haven't really got an app SEC

1191
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,940
standard of this is what we should be

1192
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,560
teaching this is what you should know

1193
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,599
these are the key skills that you should

1194
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,819
have there are parts of that information

1195
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:27,240
inside book but there is not we don't

1196
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,980
have that

1197
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,140
uh OS doesn't have it and I don't think

1198
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,819
any other professional bodies have that

1199
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:36,119
and I think because of our unique place

1200
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,339
in the industry

1201
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,560
we can probably drive that

1202
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,760
hmm

1203
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,960
yep

1204
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,660
yes I think uh from Academia perspective

1205
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,740
uh yes but how do you feel from um from

1206
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,959
uh different uh commercial organizations

1207
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,579
I think there if there's an open

1208
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,900
standard

1209
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,160
again

1210
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,960
if someone's paying for trading if

1211
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,339
you're paying a specialist training

1212
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,680
provider you want to know what it is

1213
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,560
they're achieving what you're what your

1214
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,960
employees are achieving to what standard

1215
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,400
are they being educated

1216
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,500
hmm what is it that they're going to

1217
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,619
learn those take away so I'm not I won't

1218
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,119
mention any names there's a lot of

1219
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,339
people that provide app set training in

1220
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:24,180
quote in quotes always standard and what

1221
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,099
that means for some of them is here's

1222
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,900
the OS top 10 I'm going to teach you the

1223
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,180
OS top 10.

1224
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,060
um I will possibly teach you how to fix

1225
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,099
some of the OS top 10

1226
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,079
vulnerabilities but it's all based

1227
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,240
around that

1228
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,520
nothing necessarily wrong with that but

1229
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,380
what is that saying

1230
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,500
the OS top 10. it's brilliant

1231
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,540
yeah but it is just the top 10

1232
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,000
vulnerabilities

1233
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,079
there are countless others so

1234
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,220
it doesn't necessarily teach you

1235
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,020
everything you need to know

1236
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,940
awareness of it and everything it comes

1237
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,339
out of it it's great but is it is it

1238
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:03,900
doing the whole job

1239
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,220
so

1240
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,440
um and Technical profilers are saying uh

1241
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,119
OS certified training because we teach

1242
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,920
news video about top 10 well

1243
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,280
yes and no and I think there's a lot

1244
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,420
missing from that because you're

1245
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,740
basically not necessarily that's just in

1246
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,599
the basic principles it might be that

1247
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,160
someone teaching you I've dropped 10 and

1248
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,579
they pull in web quilt a great project

1249
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,520
um as is too short

1250
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,160
but it's they are so much more than just

1251
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,260
the top ten

1252
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,319
and things drop in and drop out of the

1253
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,420
OS top 10 I think apart from Secret

1254
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,160
injection and cross-sized scripting

1255
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,520
things change and things so yeah it

1256
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,900
needs yeah there's an opportunity for

1257
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,240
the commercial train providers to

1258
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,280
really benefit from this type of work as

1259
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,460
well

1260
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,339
yeah I mean uh you're right I think OS

1261
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:58,619
top 10 has been uh one of the standards

1262
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,420
which is adopted in a lot of compliance

1263
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,520
bodies as well including let's say PCI

1264
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,720
DSS

1265
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,180
um like okay are you compliant by by OS

1266
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,579
top 10 but yes what is a West opt-in and

1267
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,260
and are there other vulnerabilities and

1268
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,760
what are the risks revolving around it

1269
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,380
that is true

1270
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,339
um and what do you think about at which

1271
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,140
level in a company

1272
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,700
um these things should be injecting I

1273
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,559
mean a typical question you know with

1274
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,540
the different Transformations happening

1275
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,180
around with respect to devsecops for

1276
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,680
example

1277
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,559
um how do you see on which level it

1278
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,720
should be important for people to

1279
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,520
understand that yes there should be a

1280
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,440
curriculum and security education is

1281
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,000
important

1282
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,880
I mean it's horses for courses isn't it

1283
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,420
um

1284
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,980
and some of this is yeah some of the oh

1285
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,220
so basically

1286
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,260
um trying to think about this

1287
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,760
um

1288
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,460
so the board senior managers need to be

1289
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,260
maybe don't need to know the the tech

1290
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,359
all the technical detail but they need

1291
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,640
to have a strong overview the security

1292
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,760
needs to be part of any development

1293
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,020
program

1294
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,760
security is not just done at the end

1295
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,099
it's not part of the end user test or

1296
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,220
the beta test or it

1297
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,880
um

1298
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,400
as part of a development process you

1299
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,240
need security people involved at the

1300
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,160
requirements Gathering uh so things like

1301
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,760
um

1302
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,280
oh

1303
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,020
um threat modeling

1304
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,900
um early on so you diagrammatically see

1305
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,579
how they say this is how we might build

1306
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:37,319
a system these are the requirements but

1307
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:39,420
where might the threat points be so the

1308
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,579
early and that's part of the education

1309
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,800
program knowing

1310
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,260
what tools might apply at different

1311
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,020
stages and where you go to to get that

1312
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,839
education so sometimes it comes back to

1313
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,040
the signpost and the mapping and

1314
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,839
knowing that at a high level

1315
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,940
helps you build the security culture

1316
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,920
into your organization

1317
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,099
so you it you develop different sets of

1318
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,420
criteria for different parts of an

1319
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,520
organization and that is perhaps a

1320
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,319
longer further goal further down the

1321
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,720
road yes

1322
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,599
yes I think uh from from process

1323
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,579
perspective as well it is also really

1324
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,520
important that it should have but uh you

1325
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,720
know there are changes which are

1326
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,520
happening in the organization and that

1327
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,520
is a good point or good injection point

1328
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,380
that let's say to to include security

1329
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,380
education as as well in the overall

1330
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,780
changes yeah

1331
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,400
okay

1332
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,020
um there are a couple of more questions

1333
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,119
uh for example

1334
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,180
um how did the or let's say what's

1335
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,800
what's your impression from the industry

1336
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,780
about your proposal

1337
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,760
so what's what's the

1338
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,020
impression

1339
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,339
from

1340
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,559
the industry

1341
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,319
um I mean the the initial discussions

1342
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,160
I've had I've said that there is a need

1343
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,380
for that

1344
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,839
um or that coordination

1345
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,460
funding it is a different other matter

1346
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,500
but there's definitely a need for

1347
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,819
someone to pull that and that's

1348
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:14,180
something that OS was well placed to do

1349
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,339
and it should should these courses be

1350
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,619
um targeting to a language or should it

1351
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:25,319
be language agnostic or you know it

1352
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:26,700
should be technology agnostic for

1353
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,920
example it should be technology just a

1354
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,900
bit taking take a Viewpoint the

1355
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,700
different development language different

1356
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,740
techniques exist and it's again it's

1357
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,299
it's about ensuring that people

1358
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,480
um

1359
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,740
um and we need to get different

1360
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,319
um different

1361
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:47,940
organizations involved

1362
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,040
um to sort of point that out but yeah it

1363
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,079
needs to be technology agnostic

1364
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,319
but it also needs to be uh and let's

1365
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:59,520
read language I mean lots of the sort of

1366
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,380
tools that we have in the organization

1367
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,000
are have been translated into other

1368
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,460
languages so you see I think yeah start

1369
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,480
with start with the most popular

1370
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,119
languages and then you can

1371
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,460
um translate as needed

1372
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,540
yep

1373
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,940
okay

1374
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,079
um

1375
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,240
and what what do you think should be the

1376
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,400
medium of communication or delivering

1377
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,680
this curriculum it should be multimedia

1378
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,200
based like you know a lot of others who

1379
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,300
are doing e-learning is also having some

1380
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,760
kind of pre-recorded courses or let's

1381
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,839
say some practice that that is down I

1382
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:40,020
mean the the correct a curriculum will

1383
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,380
just be a set of learning objectives

1384
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,780
links to the tools typical type of

1385
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,260
content it's not the actual material

1386
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,180
um it's a first step into developing

1387
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,160
that material or to link into what

1388
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,020
already exists so it's not really

1389
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,520
whether it's multimedia or anything like

1390
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,200
this at the moment it's it's having the

1391
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,720
building blocks in the first place that

1392
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,260
you can adapt and organization to adapt

1393
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,220
yep and and do you have any suggestions

1394
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,859
uh for the research students how do they

1395
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,140
proceed in an appropriate way

1396
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,940
um you know because this is this thing

1397
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,500
is now building up

1398
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,780
um and what are your thoughts on on the

1399
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,140
current uh status

1400
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,240
at the moment because there's very

1401
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,420
little standardization

1402
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,059
um people are building that's why people

1403
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:32,880
just use the OS top 10 and as as their

1404
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,280
building tool but there's so much more

1405
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,300
material that we could use

1406
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,440
yeah so it it that that that's what the

1407
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,000
stepping stones are trying to build on

1408
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,559
that material

1409
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,140
um and provide the links to what's there

1410
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,420
and identifying what the gaps are so

1411
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,220
that you can feel those

1412
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,960
um process

1413
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,599
yep yeah anyways I mean uh all that is

1414
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,119
uh having uh pre-taught off information

1415
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,119
as well in terms of uh how to do secure

1416
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,780
coding for example on our on on how you

1417
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,280
can actually exploit a particular

1418
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,900
vulnerability or identify a

1419
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,940
vulnerability and a lot of applications

1420
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,680
as well as you pointed out earlier in

1421
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,619
your talk it's about it's about links to

1422
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:17,880
that information because there's a lot

1423
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,579
of information but it's not cool it's

1424
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,740
not necessarily coordinated enough to

1425
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,500
pull it together and that that's because

1426
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,200
everyone needs education continuing

1427
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,780
education so that needs the part of it

1428
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,300
is to bring all of it into some sort of

1429
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,000
umbrella and then keep it going as well

1430
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,440
right because there are things which are

1431
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,119
changing as you said things are changing

1432
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,700
over time and it's keeping abreast of

1433
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,319
those changes and keeping that updated

1434
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:44,280
yeah

1435
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,619
yeah yeah yeah and with with the new

1436
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:49,200
advent of technology is like you know

1437
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,680
um the standardization of uh of maybe

1438
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,980
classification of tools and more and

1439
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,380
more use of cloud there might be changes

1440
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,020
in application security as well oh yeah

1441
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,240
there's boundaries yes yeah exactly as

1442
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,740
we were also seeing in one of the

1443
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,720
Keynotes like you know things are going

1444
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,020
to change and maybe uh

1445
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,540
um I am based issues will be more

1446
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,180
important are from architecture from

1447
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,800
architecture perspective so it is really

1448
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,180
important to understand how security

1449
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,800
works and if we interpret in a

1450
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,680
curriculum it is the best yep exactly

1451
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,380
yeah

1452
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:28,079
okay uh I think we have nearing at the

1453
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,440
top of the hour uh and thank you for uh

1454
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,540
such a wonderful talk and plethora of

1455
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,040
information for us

1456
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,599
um and thank you to all the attendees

1457
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,079
for for posing up questions and being an

1458
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,180
interactive audience

1459
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,460
um so thank you very much uh I think you

1460
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,119
can reach out to uh to Adrian uh on his

1461
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,359
Twitter handle or to his email and uh
