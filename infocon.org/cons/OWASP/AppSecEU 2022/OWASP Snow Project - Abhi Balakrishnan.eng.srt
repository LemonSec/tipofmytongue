security Compass

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
um if you guys will notice there is an

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,320
option to ask questions to the right of

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,880
your screen if you're in the huba app

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,359
that has been disabled in Zoom um but go

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,460
ahead and feel free to and ask any

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,140
questions and we will be taking a few

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,840
minutes at the end of the session to go

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,980
ahead and answer any of the questions

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,800
that you have so um with that I will

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,719
turn it over to ATP who is ready to

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,280
present thank you

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,320
thank you thank you Christina thanks

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,360
everybody for joining

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,620
let me share the screen I hope all of

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,719
you are able to see the screen

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,719
uh today I'm going to talk about uh new

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,960
OS Project called Avast snow and we will

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,480
discuss how obvious snow can help you

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,539
active slightly more priority there's a

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,979
reason why I'm saying slightly more

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,000
privacy because this tool cannot

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,060
obviously give you 100 of privacy

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,439
the website for us now is

30
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,840
privaciesnow.com and this is the logo or

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
mass code for the project the project

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,880
name is avasts now

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,360
a short version of what this tool does

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,520
before actually getting into the final

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,880
details so a short version is snow is a

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
software

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,579
version of a privacy screen guard I hope

38
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,400
that gives a high level idea of what

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,320
this tool is going to do

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
uh if you don't it's okay I'm going to

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,420
discuss that in detail in the upcoming

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,280
slides

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
all right the before going ahead I have

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,860
a question so the question is you can

45
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,600
see a picture on your height right hand

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,680
side there's a person sitting uh and

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,299
doing something on their laptop maybe

48
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,179
they are checking their emails social

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,459
media or transfer making some

50
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,220
transactions or whatever and there is a

51
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,160
person behind standing and they are

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,040
looking over there the sitting person's

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,099
shoulder onto the screen and this the

54
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,080
standing person is performing some sort

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,239
of an attack the question is what is

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,860
this attack called

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,680
the you have four choices

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,640
a password guessing C cyber stalking C

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,260
Shoulder surfing

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,140
the credential surfing so if you if you

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,280
can uh guess or say what's the answer

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll I'll take a quick look into my

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
whole app to see if I have any responses

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,220
shoulder surfing that is the correct

65
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,099
answer the standing person is performing

66
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,200
a shoulder surfing attack

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
now the second question I have is what

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
does the lecture c stand for in the CIA

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,280
trial we all know Cas seen as one of the

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,800
core principles of cyber security so

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,140
what does the letter C stands and say hi

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,599
your options are a continuity b

73
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,599
consultancy c Central the

74
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,120
confidentiality I will wait for the

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,239
answer

76
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,720
right so if you have answered C

77
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,159
confidentiality that is the correct

78
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,580
answer so shouting sort of Surfing

79
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,560
results in compromising confidentiality

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,819
one of the core principles of

81
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,340
information security or you can say it

82
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,760
affects privacy of the person so that is

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,920
the short resourcing attack now the

84
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,720
second question is like how can you

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
defend from shoulder surfing attack

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
right there are lots of different

87
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,620
solutions available based on the type of

88
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,900
attack so if say for example when you

89
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,180
walk into a store and you're purchasing

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,819
something with their debit card and you

91
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,239
have to enter a pin at that time you may

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,920
Define yourself from somebody from

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,099
stealing your PIN by covering the number

94
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,459
pad with your hand while typing the pin

95
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,738
with the other hand so that that is a

96
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,839
production mechanism so similarly there

97
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,880
are lots of different mechanisms you can

98
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,840
use and we will we will look at into one

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,900
of the option so this is a privacy

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,380
screen guard you can purchase them from

101
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,840
the uh from store like an online store

102
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,699
or I think you can go walk into some

103
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,620
stores and you can get from there as

104
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,680
well what it basically does is that you

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,540
you have a

106
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,060
film are available you basically apply

107
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,600
that film on your laptop monitor or or

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,440
phone and that will help you access some

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
privacy by limiting the viewing angle so

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
somebody needs to sit right in front of

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
the screen and they have to be facing

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,340
right uh right the screen from the front

113
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,860
to actually see the screen so if you

114
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,139
move the spawn a little you won't be

115
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,940
able to see the screen what is going on

116
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,560
in the script

117
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,900
so like I said there is a mobile version

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,100
also available

119
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,040
uh these are the four main issues when

120
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,759
you use these type of physical privacy

121
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,840
screen types one you need to spend money

122
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,699
all these privacy screen guards are

123
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,860
after market Solutions I haven't seen

124
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,900
any mobile phone laptop or uh monitor

125
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,380
manufacturers giving these privacy

126
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,419
stream cards in their package right so

127
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,620
you have to

128
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,660
you have to go ahead and purchase these

129
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,560
credit cards by spending extra money

130
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,259
the second thing if it affects viewing

131
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,139
angle for me personally that has been a

132
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,259
big deal deal breaker because

133
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,960
yes I want privacy but there are some

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,419
there are times when I want to say share

135
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,419
a video or something and and watch it

136
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,120
together with my friends or spouse and

137
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,699
and at that time they won't be able to

138
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,340
see what's going on the screen and

139
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,860
unless I give my phone to them and they

140
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,400
stand right in front of it right or say

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,280
when I'm in office if I have a privacy

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
screen card on my laptop if one call

143
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,440
colleague walks over and they want to

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,840
work with me on some things if they are

145
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,300
sitting on a chair next to me they won't

146
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,699
be able to see what is on the screen so

147
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,280
that that has been a problem of course

148
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,180
you can peel that off for that time and

149
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,039
that brings us to the third problem

150
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,160
which is it is not easy to install every

151
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,979
time the thing of privacy cards as

152
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,020
whatever that template glass protector

153
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,360
you have on your phone right if you

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,580
remove that and stick it on again yes

155
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,220
you can do that but maybe it will create

156
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,120
more bubbles it can easily get that

157
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,240
these are these are very prone to this

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,000
creating Bubbles and air air bubbles so

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you have to be really careful and have

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,460
to be an expert in it to install it

161
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,039
properly so yeah it is not easy to

162
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,740
install then the fourth one is it can be

163
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,780
tough to get the right size so if you

164
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,680
you we have monitors laptop screens and

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,919
mobile phones available in various sizes

166
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,620
and privacy screen guard protectors

167
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,340
those manufacturing companies can't uh

168
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,099
they they they they will create screen

169
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,520
guards for some phones or devices which

170
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,560
are popular but if you have a special

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,319
size or if you have a new model of a

172
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,479
monitor all of you like I say have a new

173
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
widescreen monitor or a new phone with a

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,639
different aspect ratio basically you

175
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,560
have to buy something bigger and maybe

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,300
cut it with your with the scissor and

177
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,940
that's not ideal right so you get the

178
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,740
idea it's not easy with these physical

179
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,259
ones and that's why I thought hey maybe

180
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,360
there should be something a software

181
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,460
version right of the Privacy Street gun

182
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,360
and that is what OS now is basically

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,199
when you enable snow and just like uh

184
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,199
when when you you must be knowing dark

185
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
mode right on the websites if you enable

186
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
dark mode suddenly it changes colors

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
similar to that if you turn on snow the

188
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
under tree screen will get blurred back

189
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,899
stack pictures will get uh illegible you

190
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,240
won't be able to treat them but then if

191
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,779
you move your mouse cursor on top of it

192
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,458
of the elements that you want to read

193
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,160
whatever immediately underneath that

194
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,680
cursor becomes visible so you would be

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,959
able to read that portion over there so

196
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,660
someone looking over your shoulder they

197
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,399
would even if they are looking at the

198
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,920
screen they they need to see where the

199
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,500
mouse cursor is moving and read and what

200
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,940
is underneath that so you have some

201
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,160
protection so say for example you are

202
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,380
logging into your bank account and you

203
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,839
already know what your bank balance is

204
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,940
so you don't have to hover your cursor

205
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,580
on top of fact so somebody standing next

206
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,220
to you wouldn't be able to read how much

207
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,700
balance you have so a similar same thing

208
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,860
goes for say an email ID a phone number

209
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,940
displayed on the web page right so all

210
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,940
of them we become blurred and nobody

211
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,800
would be able to read that

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
so the advantages of

213
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
using a software version is faster snow

214
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,339
is free you basically enable this and

215
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,080
you don't have to actually go ahead and

216
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,600
purchase it second it won't affect

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,779
weaving angles so you can turn off snow

218
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,800
easily uh as well so if you want snow

219
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
you you just click a button if you don't

220
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
want to snow don't not to be on it's

221
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,700
again you just click on a button that's

222
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,180
it also Size Doesn't Matter the snow

223
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,420
software is like it is it is basically a

224
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,360
JavaScript so basically uh whatever your

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,380
screen size is it it can shrink or

226
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,080
expand so viewing uh the size of the

227
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,580
screen is not going to affect the

228
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,940
experience of the Privacy right so that

229
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,339
those are the those are the advantages

230
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,740
of using a software version in this case

231
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,440
Oslo

232
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,040
now now you know what uh East of West

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,399
snow you also know what are the pros and

234
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,580
cons of using a physical version of

235
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,180
privacy screen and also uh what are the

236
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,640
advantages of using uh the software

237
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,019
version which is our snow I will quickly

238
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,540
post here before moving on to the next

239
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,019
section of the presentation to see if we

240
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,360
have any other questions on whoa whoa

241
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
okay looks like I don't have any

242
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,300
questions so we will move on to the next

243
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,579
part

244
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,680
I want to say that snow we won't give

245
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,700
you 100 privacy so even if you have this

246
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,560
snow chained on

247
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
it is not 100 right if you are in a

248
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
coffee shop and is connected to a random

249
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,360
Wi-Fi which is controlled by an attacker

250
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,600
or random insecure Wi-Fi

251
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,779
snow can protect you there so snow is

252
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,360
just protecting what is on your screen

253
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,160
even on the screen when when you talk

254
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,560
about the screen say for example you are

255
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,040
talking to somebody uh okay you're

256
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
chatting with somebody and you're typing

257
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
something on the keyboard and somebody

258
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,660
the only your screen is protected so if

259
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,399
somebody looks over your shoulder to see

260
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,700
what you are typing on your keyboard

261
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,519
they can still based on your finger

262
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,560
movement they can see what you are

263
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,360
typing and the snow is not going to

264
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,480
protect you over there so those are the

265
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,220
issues with us all with the with the

266
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,899
with snow

267
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,420
similarly some if you are entering a pin

268
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,279
or something you still need to hide it

269
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
right other other orders if somebody is

270
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,100
recording what you are typing or or if

271
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,740
there's a CCTV camera somewhere just

272
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,300
grabbing your screen or then they would

273
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,740
be able to go back Zoom it up watch it

274
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,100
slowly and see what was underneath your

275
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,320
cursor and would be able to read those

276
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
content right so in those cases no it's

277
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
not going to help you if it was a

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
physical screen privacy card

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,720
uh it would have protected you from CCTV

280
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
attacks because

281
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,639
CCTV would be in a different angle we'll

282
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,899
be looking at the screen from a

283
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,779
different angle and since privacy stream

284
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,060
cards is going to reduce the viewing

285
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,279
angle it can protect you there so that's

286
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,980
that's the difference between a software

287
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,279
version and a physical version

288
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,300
now third question what is this ancient

289
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,040
equipment

290
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm looking for the answers there are

291
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,740
four options it is a phone B it's a

292
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,440
morse code machine three it's an

293
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,740
encryption device encryptor or it is a

294
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,579
music player I will see if anybody have

295
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,120
any answers

296
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,459
I'll pause for a second

297
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,100
if you know the answer just type A B C

298
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,339
or D

299
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,800
all right so if you have answered it's a

300
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
phone you are correct it's an ancient uh

301
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,260
telephone I I see the right answers in

302
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,100
the uh so thank you Eric so yeah this is

303
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,480
a telephone

304
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,639
why we are talking about telephone I'll

305
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,279
come I'll come to that in a bit

306
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,399
now fourth question what are these two

307
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,079
people doing

308
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,680
you again you have four options they are

309
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,360
making a new thread

310
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,820
be they are waiting at the fishing

311
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,980
finishing point for a runner so there is

312
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,019
a marathon or Sprint happening and

313
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,880
they're beating in the finishing line so

314
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,779
that somebody can uh hit those uh Ribbon

315
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,279
or thread right

316
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,220
third option is C uh they are talking to

317
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,360
each other

318
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,779
fourth option is D they are talking and

319
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,600
thinking

320
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,540
okay so uh I have a right answer again

321
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,700
see they are talking to each other so

322
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,260
this is called that they are

323
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,240
communicating right they are using what

324
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,459
is called a tin can telephone or a lover

325
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,160
phone most of you have the same thing

326
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,300
you see uh paper cups and uh some

327
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,240
threads when you were a kid maybe you

328
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,720
still do so the the the the those those

329
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,660
are very familiar to us why I'm

330
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,839
discussing about that is that uh is is

331
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,880
another that leads to another question

332
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,579
what does both of them have in common

333
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,180
from a privacy standpoint

334
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,160
uh so what does an ancient telephone

335
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,440
and this Tin Can telephone Lover's phone

336
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,880
have common from a privacy standpoint

337
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
so the answer is

338
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,040
they have privacy built into it there is

339
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,220
a reason the telephone has an ear piece

340
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,040
instead of a loudspeaker even with the

341
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680
lovers phone one has to place it on over

342
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,440
their ear to hear what the other person

343
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,579
is saying it is not like uh you uh put

344
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,260
it over there and everybody around you

345
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,660
can hear it right so they have privacy

346
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,139
built into it and those are ancient

347
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,880
stuffs

348
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
um how about the software and Hardware

349
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,579
we Define these days right they don't

350
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,100
have many of these software and Hardware

351
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,199
are not designed uh are defined with

352
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,560
privacy mind uh there is a comment that

353
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,420
says you could easily intercept the

354
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,120
course with the action telephones and

355
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,360
even with uh Lover's phone yes that is

356
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,240
correct so the the

357
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,060
they have those issues and I and sadly

358
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,579
we have those issues even now uh with

359
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,880
latest technology and stuff but yeah we

360
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,199
at least we have

361
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,740
we have some controls right so yeah it

362
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,180
is good uh we are there so uh what I'm

363
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,820
saying is that uh

364
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,139
we should be having uh a shoulder

365
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,500
surfing protection built in in our

366
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,480
software or Hardware that's what I'm

367
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,100
trying to say

368
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,459
now now you know uh we already discussed

369
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,259
what is a West now so now you know what

370
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,959
is no uh you know the difference between

371
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,040
a physical privacy screen and wasps no

372
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,439
and you know how we used to design

373
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,619
technology with privacy in mind and then

374
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,419
you now you know also know what you

375
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,699
think bottom soft privacy in today's

376
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,179
software right I will quickly check who

377
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,859
out to see if I have any other questions

378
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,140
before moving on to the next section

379
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,400
within the presentation

380
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,000
right I don't have any other questions I

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,720
will go to the next section so right now

382
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,160
who asks now is available on web Windows

383
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,780
Chrome and Firefox

384
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,440
so if you are

385
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,120
developing a website and that is the

386
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
first portion if you are developing a

387
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,960
website we have a snow JavaScript

388
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,179
available I will give you more details

389
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,520
in the upcoming slides if you are using

390
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,280
a Windows laptop or desktop then you can

391
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
you there is a nice soft chairs now

392
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,780
software it's an experimental version

393
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,120
but it is available on Chrome and

394
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,940
Firefox so you can we have a browser

395
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,419
extensions or add-ons are available all

396
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,880
of them are free and open source for

397
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
sure

398
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,039
so one thing I want to plug it here is

399
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,620
that initially when I developed August

400
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,640
now it was only uh on I it was just a

401
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,400
vibration at Chrome version I present

402
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,740
before presenting in Virtual absec

403
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,080
virtual apps against the conference I

404
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,700
wanted I presented it in a small

405
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,380
conference near my home in in Canada and

406
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,740
one of the attendees said hey I can Port

407
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,620
the Chrome extension to into Firefox I

408
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,539
can create a Firefox extension formats

409
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,240
now and I was like yeah great go ahead

410
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,539
and do it and Tobias who was an attendee

411
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,000
went ahead and he created that Firefox

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,039
extension that's how that's how we have

413
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,740
a Firefox extension uh similarly my

414
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,440
brother said hey I I I like this project

415
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,200
I can't create one for Windows and he

416
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,740
created the windows version uh so that

417
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,340
is the beauty of us and open source I

418
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,059
think when I I basically obvious to know

419
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,360
was a was my need I wanted privacy when

420
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,039
when working on my uh laptop or or when

421
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,799
I'm surfing web on my phone or whatever

422
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,220
and I I would have I created that

423
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,380
extension and I was using it personally

424
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,419
and at one point of time I thought hey

425
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,640
maybe I can publish that maybe some

426
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,500
people will get uh

427
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,539
it will be useful for them right I open

428
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,780
source rate but uh but not it was not

429
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,460
getting anywhere and I was like hey

430
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,160
maybe I should promote it to uh so that

431
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,600
people will know such a project access

432
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,140
and I presented it in novice Vancouver

433
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,760
and that led to a nice Firefox extension

434
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,360
and that led to a window special so

435
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,000
that's why I love ovac so if you have a

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,059
great ideas like this I think you should

437
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,640
at least put out the idea somewhere so

438
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,220
that people can contribute to it right

439
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,400
there are lots of talented folks here in

440
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,580
novas band and actively available in the

441
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,140
information security industry so

442
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,620
absolutely of it and I I just want to

443
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,940
mention that

444
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,320
now obvious noise not available in Mac

445
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,020
iPhone iPad Linux or or an Android and

446
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,140
maybe if you are a developer on any of

447
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,539
these platforms maybe you can help this

448
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,020
project by plotting uh or creating a new

449
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,760
ask Innovation for any of these

450
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
platforms there was also one requirement

451
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
that August snow currently Works based

452
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
on a mouse cursor right where you move

453
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,419
your mouse mouse cursor and that means

454
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,780
somebody needs to move their cursor to

455
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,200
read what what is underneath that cursor

456
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,380
and it raises accessible issues some

457
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
people may not use

458
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,080
track parts or Mouse they may maybe they

459
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,140
will use keyboard or they will just use

460
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,020
touch screens right so in that case I

461
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,799
have can we can we can't say hey we are

462
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,039
not entitled to privacy because you are

463
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,080
using a keyboard to navigate now we

464
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,260
should not

465
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,159
so that is one thing that I want to

466
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,900
address so if you have any ideas for

467
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,280
that uh you are all welcome I I I'm open

468
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,140
to hear those ideas

469
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,640
um this is that is the next thing I'm

470
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,120
going to do I'm trying to see uh what

471
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,580
are the accessibility softwares are

472
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,260
available out there and I can integrate

473
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,320
snow with them uh so yeah so that that

474
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,280
research is still going on

475
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,880
basically

476
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,840
I want now to be the next dark mode when

477
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
when I see dark mode being interrupted

478
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,460
by lots of softwares out there lots of

479
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,640
phones hardware and a software every

480
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,679
everyone is jumping into the dark mode

481
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,860
bandwagon and I want not to be there

482
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,940
because our privacy is is of utmost

483
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,559
importance

484
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
now I talked about the web fashion so if

485
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,720
you are if you have a website and you

486
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,780
want you really care about your

487
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,480
customers privacy and you want to know

488
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,340
available to them

489
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,220
there is a privacy snow extension sorry

490
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,220
JavaScript available you can go to

491
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,620
privacysnow.com and you can get this uh

492
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,000
piece of core code you just

493
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,720
add that to your website included using

494
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,140
script SRC then you can have a button

495
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,980
somewhere on your website with on click

496
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,260
private system or something of that sort

497
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,500
and that function will trigger start to

498
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,320
be on and off so maybe you can use that

499
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,559
on your website uh after heading back

500
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,940
from this session

501
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,059
or you if or if you have a website that

502
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,820
you wish it had of us know maybe you can

503
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,559
talk to them and see if they can

504
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,900
integrate snow

505
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,600
now if you are using Google Chrome or

506
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,179
Firefox we have super snow and small

507
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,900
light two extensions available you once

508
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,000
you installed them

509
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,120
you can see this nice little icon on top

510
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,940
if you click on that uh snow will depend

511
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,520
on everything will get blurred if you

512
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,100
click on it again it will be turned off

513
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,440
if you are on Windows download our

514
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,200
Windows station and run run it and it

515
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,580
will go to the tray it will get

516
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,740
minimized many people have said that hey

517
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,720
I have run the tool and nothing is

518
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,419
happening right so when you run the tool

519
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,720
it is going to start uh

520
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,539
and go to tray you have to go to tray

521
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,179
and right click on it and turn on the

522
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,000
snow then snow will be on and if you

523
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,240
want to turn off you can turn it off one

524
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,740
nice thing about the windows version is

525
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,760
that it unlike the browservation it

526
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,020
gives slightly more uh features I it

527
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,200
gives you more granular controls the

528
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,179
other problem with web version is that

529
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,919
if you are using Google Chrome or

530
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,380
Firefox and you are using snow it is

531
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,380
available on Chrome or Firefox right and

532
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,760
if you are using some other desktop

533
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,460
software so it's not available there but

534
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,220
if you are using the windows version

535
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,159
every every app is covered right so that

536
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,640
that is the advantage of using the

537
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,500
windows creation it is still

538
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,799
experimental so you may face some issues

539
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,780
here and there the source code is

540
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,700
available if you want to modify it but

541
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,360
if you report that back to me my brother

542
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,679
is working talking about that so maybe

543
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,460
I'll ask him to fix it and uh so yeah

544
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,559
let me know

545
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,820
now you know uh where all you can use

546
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,880
now or or where you can't use now

547
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,340
and you you also know how Avast and

548
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,140
collaborate collaboration can help us

549
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,380
right in improving privacy or improving

550
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,080
information security I will take a quick

551
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,940
click and who are to see if I have any

552
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,520
more questions before going to the next

553
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,139
section within the presentation

554
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,620
no questions yet all right thanks so

555
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,380
where all you can use snow uh that

556
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,159
that's uh that's something uh

557
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,820
which is obvious say for example if

558
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,480
you're at home and you are buying a

559
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,179
surprise gift for your spouse and you

560
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,700
don't want supposed to know it then then

561
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,480
you can use snow even at home or if you

562
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,220
are at work you are creating some a new

563
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,980
uh groundbreaking technology whatever

564
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,620
stuff and you don't want your co-worker

565
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,860
to know or some competitor to know you

566
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,039
can use snowy on your on your laptop

567
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,340
if you are commuting to work using any

568
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,059
public transport chances are that

569
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,740
somebody may look over your shoulder to

570
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,539
see what's happening on your phone or

571
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,120
tablet or laptop or whatever so if you

572
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,059
can use snow over there

573
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,880
there's an interesting piece there why

574
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,279
why I created OS snow in first place

575
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,240
right so when I started my career I I

576
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,120
used to work in Delhi and I used to take

577
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,279
daily Metro every time it's a it's a

578
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,400
metro train and I used to go in the

579
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,380
morning to the office and we'll head

580
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,640
back in the evening to home uh and it it

581
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,500
is usually rushed there are lots of

582
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,260
people and sometimes you'll be sitting

583
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,480
on your chair and looking at your phone

584
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
because you have a lot of time and you

585
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,299
are going through the phone at some and

586
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,659
many times when I'm in the train I can

587
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,460
see that people are looking over

588
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,860
somebody's shoulders it is easy when

589
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,799
somebody's sitting and some uh and

590
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,200
checking their phone somebody standing

591
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,419
can easily look over the other person's

592
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,220
shoulder and see what is on the phone

593
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,220
screen right for tablet or laptop so I

594
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,100
have seen people peaking and Performing

595
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,559
shoulder surfing and I was like okay

596
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,200
there should be a solution and I've and

597
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,179
then I did some research and I came

598
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,159
across all these privacy screen guards

599
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,419
but then I was not uh I did not like the

600
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,520
idea of installing a privacy screen I

601
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,440
don't need to affect the viewing angle

602
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,260
so much I wanted something easy there

603
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,020
something you can easily turn on and off

604
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,120
and that led to the creation of how fast

605
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,159
snow even though it was not immediate it

606
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,860
took me eight or ten years because I was

607
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,880
like hey I know this solution but it's

608
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,260
it's a silly Solution that's what I

609
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,520
thought because somebody is going to

610
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,700
come up with that so maybe I'll wait and

611
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,799
maybe I will I should search and find it

612
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,799
and I I did lots of search on Google and

613
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,799
Bing and I did not find any other active

614
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,340
projects I uh doing this right then I

615
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,919
was like okay oh fine I will create

616
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,159
something so I created it I open sourced

617
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,620
it and now we have more people

618
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,520
contributing to in do it I'm creating

619
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,140
particle to different platforms so here

620
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,760
we have that

621
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,600
all right uh so before

622
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,960
looks like there are no other questions

623
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,059
so I think I will move on to the final

624
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,720
conclusion of this presentation which is

625
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,500
