yeah so let's uh let's dive in so I

55
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,400
guess in terms of uh who am I first of

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,099
all I think uh covered up pretty well

57
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,180
already

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,319
um working as an application security

59
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,660
consultant about security

60
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,599
um Consulting training generally you

61
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,519
know helping other organizations build a

62
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,000
secure owner builds uh secure software

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,720
um and uh in my in my spare time I'm a

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,940
co-leader of the OSP SES project I'm

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,920
also uh have contributed to various

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,340
other OS projects as well and uh I'm

67
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,140
also on the oldest Israel chapter board

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,019
so he uh organizer obviously our chapter

69
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,540
meetups and also the uh appsec IL

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,220
conference so we've organized for the

71
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,959
last few years

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,260
so uh yeah I was very much a hobby and

73
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,260
uh in particularly the asvs so

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,500
today I want to talk about a few things

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,060
um Let me give a bit of background to

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,040
asbs sort of talk about it in the

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
context of some of the other OS projects

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,239
you may be more more familiar with

79
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,159
um talk a little bit about what the

80
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,560
project is what it aims to do how it can

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,879
help

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,140
um I'll talk about a few things that

83
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,599
make it interesting I think that uh it's

84
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,099
important to pull out some of the

85
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,659
highlights you know why I think this is

86
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,459
such a an important project and why I

87
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,840
think this is a can be very beneficial

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
for everyone who's involved in in

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,220
software security

90
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,019
um I want to talk about how you can use

91
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,659
it how you can get involved and uh you

92
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,239
know contribute back to the project and

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,560
most importantly I want to talk about

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,140
the the roadmap as we plan for version

95
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,440
5.0 that we're hoping to prepare for the

96
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,720
end of the year which uh is certainly a

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,239
big important step and uh hopefully you

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,599
can also help contribute to that as well

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,400
so without further Ado

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,000
um so what is the asvs so it's the first

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
question a lot a lot of people ask and I

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,320
like to say well let's start off with

103
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,839
not what is the SPs but what is the asps

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,780
not what isn't the asvs I think in some

105
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,919
ways that's a a good way of starting

106
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,139
so if we start with the OS top 10 the OS

107
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,940
top 10 risks this is probably you know

108
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,500
the most famous OS Project the most

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,840
well-known OS Project

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,080
um this is a list of the top 10

111
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,699
bad things that could happen from

112
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,620
application security perspective that

113
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,800
gets released every three to four years

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
um and you know this is a really great

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
project it's a really important project

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,380
it's led by a group of you know very

117
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,080
well respected experts in the field and

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,120
the most recent versions of 2017 version

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,060
the 2021 version they had a lot of

120
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,580
really great feedback from the public

121
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,320
and they're very much developed in the

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,759
open and they used a lot of public data

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,199
and used a lot of public information to

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,820
say well you know here's here's what we

125
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,860
think should go into these projects

126
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
uh yeah you can see it's on the on the

127
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,300
GitHub repository there and you know

128
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,580
it's it's very frequently cited but the

129
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,740
important key word here I guess is is

130
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,419
awareness this is a an application

131
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,740
security awareness document

132
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,300
and you know the idea behind the the

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,160
behind the project behind the top ten

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,660
and you know this is this isn't a secret

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,340
this isn't sort of my interpretation

136
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,080
this is the the purpose of the project

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,940
it's to spread awareness about

138
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,039
application security issues about web

139
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,199
security issues

140
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,419
um these are a set of issues that can go

141
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,440
wrong

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
it is very much not designed to be a

143
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
standard

144
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,759
um we shouldn't talk about as a standard

145
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,960
we shouldn't talk about you know all

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,699
right we comply with the OS top 10 or we

147
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,100
test according to OS top 10 it's meant

148
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,720
to be an awareness awareness document

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,039
it's not a comprehensive list it doesn't

150
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,780
have every single problem that we

151
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,160
encounter from an application security

152
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,919
perspective it's here are the top 10

153
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,660
things we think you should be thinking

154
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,919
about and you know sometimes those

155
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,259
things are very specific sometimes those

156
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,900
things are very wide

157
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,360
um and also

158
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,539
another another drawback that I guess

159
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,160
I think it may make it sort of

160
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,139
challenging to build upon is that it's

161
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,120
very much you hear a list of 10 problems

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,440
here a list of things you need to be

163
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
worried about that you need to be

164
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,020
concerned about if you dig into it does

165
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,000
provide some ideas about Solutions as

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,560
well but it's primarily focused around

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,419
you know the top 10 risks the top 10

168
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,039
problems

169
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,060
so great great project for awareness but

170
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
you know can we use it to to build

171
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,240
secure software

172
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,620
less easily

173
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,780
so there's also another OS top 10 OS

174
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,060
loves top 10s um as you may have noticed

175
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,620
and there's another top ten that's

176
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,039
called the top 10 proactive controls

177
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,600
so this is another really great project

178
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,639
and it's it's focus is slightly

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,080
different though it's about it's more of

180
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,759
a guidance document and it's about

181
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,560
pulling out sort of 10

182
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,539
I guess best practices 10 leading

183
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,979
practices for building secure software

184
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,500
so we can see that you know these are

185
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,139
sort of proactive practical ways that

186
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,960
you can build six software in a secure

187
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,120
way you know these are

188
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,919
things that we can we can actually do

189
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,180
these are things that we have it's not

190
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,440
just oh no what's what am I going to do

191
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,360
about this problem these are practices

192
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,620
that we can take in apply in our

193
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,599
development

194
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,400
um and because that this is this is a

195
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,199
great starting point this is a great uh

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,180
place to start in terms of okay I want

197
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,099
to build a secure application what do I

198
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,300
need to think about first what security

199
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,580
issues don't you think about first

200
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,940
and it's also a lot more practical like

201
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,979
I say it's not just a list it's very

202
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,780
much a document with you know here's a

203
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,979
topic and here's some narrative about

204
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,500
that document

205
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,240
um and that gives us the ability to say

206
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,580
well okay I'm building a software

207
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,740
product and here's some good practices

208
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,419
that I can follow here some good ideas I

209
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,440
can follow to make sure that I'm

210
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,120
building in a secure way which is which

211
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,099
is great it's much more practical for

212
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,360
developers to take and start working

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,380
with

214
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,240
and it also has a great great team of

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,560
leaders are very very experienced

216
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,840
leaders in the field who are prepared

217
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,639
the documents and prepared the guidance

218
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,340
and um yeah I'd certainly highly

219
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,160
recommend it as sort of a a Gateway into

220
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,340
building secure software

221
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,259
the problem we have is that it's also

222
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,780
not completely comprehensive it's not

223
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,620
designed to be a fully comprehensive

224
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,280
um

225
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,800
application security standard it's it's

226
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,659
again more for awareness it's more about

227
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,979
you here the top 10 things you might

228
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,020
want to think about

229
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,000
um it's not organized like a standard

230
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,700
it's not organized and designed in a way

231
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,200
that okay we're going to follow this

232
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,080
standard we're going to follow this uh

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
um set of requirements in order to build

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,940
our project will build our software is

235
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,500
organized as here here's the top 10

236
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,779
things to think about

237
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,820
but what if we want to build a product

238
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,800
we want to build our

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,260
piece of software and we want to have

240
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,420
okay here's all the things we need to

241
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,060
think about here's a sort of methodical

242
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,680
way to think about building security

243
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,000
into this product what are we going to

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,760
do what are we going to do

245
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
so as you might have guessed from the

246
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,180
title of the talk

247
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,700
the answer is the oasp applications

248
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,060
security verification standard

249
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,100
so this is

250
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,019
intended to be requirements for building

251
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,820
a secure application it's designed to be

252
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,860
an actual standard

253
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,899
um the idea is that you can work through

254
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,339
this standard you can work through the

255
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,899
requirements of the standard and feel

256
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:34,980
confident okay these are the

257
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,180
requirements I needed to take into

258
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,279
account that I need to

259
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,200
um to implement in order to build a

260
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,660
secure application

261
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,880
it's and it's you know it's structured

262
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,920
in a way that will allow that to be to

263
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,180
be done it's not just a narrative

264
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,980
document it's sort of structured in a

265
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,680
set of requirements that are relatively

266
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
self-contained to allow you to say okay

267
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,720
how we're going to handle this one okay

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,740
well I'm going to handle this one

269
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,140
they're much more sort of easier to

270
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,519
digest because it's split into smaller

271
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,899
sections

272
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,060
it's designed to be leading practices

273
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,459
the idea being that we can't release a

274
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,720
new version of the standard every six

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,980
months because

276
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,720
you know people it's a standard it needs

277
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,880
to stay a little bit static it needs to

278
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
people need to go to rely on it and not

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,300
changing every five seconds

280
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,560
um because of that we try and make sure

281
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,060
that we're looking ahead and thinking

282
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
okay what are we going to be good

283
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,019
controls and good requirements and uh

284
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,880
good practice not just now but over the

285
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,500
next few years as well as a as a

286
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,760
standard continues to be relevant

287
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,380
um it's also

288
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,480
developed very much in the open like I

289
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,519
said early on about the uh the OS top 10

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,220
it's developed in in GitHub all the

291
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,839
issues and discussions are in GitHub

292
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,640
people can submit issues people can

293
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
submit feedback people can submit uh

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,079
pull requests with suggested content I

295
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,579
think you should get a lot of eyes on

296
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,800
the on the standard a lot of input into

297
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,060
what should be in the standard

298
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,019
to make it easier to apply because being

299
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,519
a standard and being comprehensive is

300
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,980
quite large it's split into three

301
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,579
different levels

302
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,079
so level one is what we consider to be

303
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,839
the the minimum level this is the idea

304
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
is this should be the minimum that a

305
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,560
company has to comply with an

306
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,360
application has to comply with in order

307
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
to be considered to have a minimum level

308
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,260
of security a minimum sort of acceptable

309
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,579
level of security

310
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,220
ideally for applications that are

311
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,019
processing less secure data or less

312
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,260
sensitive data or less critical but it's

313
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,820
an important starting point I mean this

314
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,760
itself has around 130 requirements which

315
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,700
is a lot but obviously each one of those

316
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,579
is split into each one of those is is

317
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,380
quite self-contained and quite specific

318
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,480
so it's not like we're having to

319
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,100
um think of a whole program just to deal

320
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,079
with One requirement ideally we should

321
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,279
look at a requirement figure out how

322
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,959
we're implementing it and move on so

323
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,820
although there are 130 of them

324
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,620
you know should each one shouldn't be

325
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,579
too time consuming to implement

326
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,200
another interesting point about it is

327
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,279
that

328
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,700
it should be possible to verify these

329
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,500
requirements using penetration testing

330
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
now obviously hopefully we have all

331
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,260
sorts of different security activities

332
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,760
going on but generally the the very

333
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,560
minimum security activity will someone

334
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,940
will have an organization will have will

335
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,320
be penetration testing and all of these

336
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,760
should be testable by someone who's on

337
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,660
the outside of the application

338
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,180
performing tests on the application to

339
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,860
see how it responds to certain attacks

340
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,420
or to certain uh exploitation attempts

341
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,079
so that is a useful uh useful

342
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,279
characteristic as well because it means

343
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,019
you can potentially get a very sort of

344
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,940
basic reading on okay are we doing

345
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,380
everything that should be in level one

346
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,540
of the asvs

347
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,100
and that's like I say a good starting

348
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,120
point and certainly an important

349
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,300
starting point to ease into having a

350
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,519
comprehensively secure application

351
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,200
but it is only the starting point and

352
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,940
that brings us to level two which is

353
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,040
what we consider the standard level of

354
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,839
security

355
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,360
so we would consider this as the

356
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,279
required level for any applications that

357
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,680
processing sensitive data or are being

358
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,339
relied upon for for business functions

359
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,560
and that's probably going to be a large

360
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
proportion of the applications that are

361
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
being built and then it processes

362
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,380
personal data or allows people login and

363
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,820
store sensitive data is going to be

364
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
included in this

365
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,540
it brings another set of requirements

366
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,839
another roughly 130 requirements

367
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,660
which again a lot of requirements each

368
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,700
reasonably self-contained maybe slightly

369
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,660
more difficult than a level one

370
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,040
requirements but still perfectly

371
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,139
achievable

372
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,779
um but to verify these requirements is

373
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,920
going to be a little more tricky we

374
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,540
can't just do this from someone on the

375
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,519
outside looking in it's going to need

376
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,019
some inside knowledge as well some

377
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,700
understanding of how the application is

378
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,079
working behind the scenes or how the

379
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,060
processes around the application are are

380
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,040
working behind the scenes

381
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,560
now whilst on the one hand okay that's

382
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,139
more difficult that requires a more

383
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,579
in-depth level of testing a more

384
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,040
in-depth level of Assessments we would

385
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
argue that we need to start hybrid

386
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,860
testing anyway we can't just rely on

387
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,019
external penetration testing to to

388
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,519
verify the security of an application

389
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,300
lead yeah certainly my uh previous uh

390
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,160
previous job where I was focused on

391
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,540
security testing

392
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,519
we would always try and make the

393
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,399
penetration testing as uh transparent as

394
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,720
possible to get as much information

395
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
about how the application was working

396
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,180
behind the scenes in order to better

397
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,860
Target the testing and to get better

398
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,380
coverage and uh that's the sort of tests

399
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,019
that we should be aiming for in general

400
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,459
and that sort of test should also be

401
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:27,560
able to verify level two as well

402
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,899
so it doesn't finish there though if

403
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,760
there are certain applications that are

404
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
particularly critical a very high value

405
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,680
transactions very very sensitive data

406
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,060
um we would recommend considering level

407
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,500
three as well which is the advanced

408
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,519
level

409
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,440
any application that requires the

410
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,079
highest levels of trust should uh be

411
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,279
complying with this level this level

412
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,019
includes all the previous requirements

413
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,660
plus an additional 20 requirements and

414
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,220
you know it's not a huge number of extra

415
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,800
requirements but at the same time these

416
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
will generally be more involved they'll

417
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,220
be maybe more difficult to implement and

418
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,040
and generally more require more work but

419
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,199
they what we see is important for for

420
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,500
the most critical applications

421
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,399
um

422
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,740
again we can start with level one as a

423
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,480
basic we don't want to stop there we

424
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,560
want to go to level two for any

425
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
application that's going to be in any

426
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,920
way sensitive with level three being

427
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,360
reserved for the most critical

428
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,500
applications the most sensitive

429
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,600
applications the idea being that we can

430
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,779
ease gradually into making sure that

431
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,980
we're complying with a standard

432
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,880
so

433
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,860
who's involved in this we've also got a

434
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,139
a great leadership team

435
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,040
um

436
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,740
really really proud and sort of honor to

437
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,480
be among us this group of people who

438
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,639
steer this project but it's not just the

439
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,839
leaders there's a lot of people who've

440
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,820
contributed ideas contributed feedback

441
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,040
also reviewed versions of the document

442
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,860
at various stages and provide lots of

443
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,380
useful input as well and as I said you

444
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,000
can be involved as well you're certainly

445
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,399
welcome contributions and ideas from

446
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
from all over and uh we'd be glad to

447
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
hear from anyone who wants to provide

448
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,899
their feedback or provide their ideas

449
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,000
um and like I say We'll look at later on

450
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,980
at uh where where they're standard is

451
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,279
stored

452
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,800
it's a bit of basic information about

453
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,440
the standard itself and how sort of how

454
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,260
it's uh how it's structured so one of

455
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,760
the great things about it is we've

456
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,320
written the standards written in

457
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,199
markdown language within GitHub

458
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,579
um which is nice because it makes it a

459
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,000
lot easier to

460
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,639
maintain and modify

461
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,199
the uh you know the text of the standard

462
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,940
the information in the standard but then

463
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,300
take that basic text and Export it to

464
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,519
all sorts of different uh output formats

465
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,959
depending on what your use case is we've

466
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
got scripts to generate a PDF file a

467
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,060
word file a CSV various Json formats

468
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,399
again whatever whatever works best for

469
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
the use that you have for the standard

470
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,779
the idea is by starting off in the basic

471
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,540
markdown that uh renders like nicely in

472
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,660
GitHub and uh is easy to trace than it

473
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,020
uh and it makes for a good basis and you

474
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,760
know because it's so easy to trace and

475
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,740
because it's a textual format it's very

476
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,959
easy to see sort of the evolution of the

477
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,000
requirements and where requirements have

478
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,619
come from and

479
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,780
um also Trace those you know to the the

480
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,579
point in time when the requirement is

481
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,679
created or written or committed and the

482
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,059
issue where the requirement was

483
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,439
discussed it's a lot easier to

484
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,299
understand the rationality or where did

485
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,319
this requirement come from in the first

486
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,359
place it's not just a you know not just

487
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,660
publishing a closed PDF where the uh

488
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,280
provenance of the requirements and the

489
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,200
logic behind it is all sort of hidden in

490
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
some back room somewhere

491
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,740
vast majority of this discussions in

492
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,480
GitHub and often if you're if you look

493
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,340
at requirements and think okay well why

494
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,600
is that requirement written in that way

495
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,520
you can search the ID and the issues and

496
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,080
discover the discussion and discover the

497
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,059
discussion where what that requirement

498
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,679
should included

499
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,340
um

500
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
was discussed and I think that's really

501
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,960
useful for understanding the backing

502
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,179
context behind you know why certain

503
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,440
requirements have written the way they

504
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,240
are written

505
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,559
it also makes it a lot easier to

506
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,460
translate

507
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,900
um we currently have quite a few

508
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,280
translations various different languages

509
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,919
that people have kindly uh taken the

510
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,100
time to do and contribute and

511
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,600
that's for a variety of different

512
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,000
versions and information about uh which

513
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,440
translations exist for which versions

514
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,539
are on our uh on the site but it makes

515
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,160
it a lot easier when it's all in that

516
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
textual format that it's then easy to

517
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
swap out the English with the uh other

518
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,740
language that's being translated to

519
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,760
one of the nice features about some of

520
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,380
the early sections around uh

521
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,000
authentication authorization and session

522
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,940
management is that they're mapped to uh

523
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,880
the nist standards

524
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,320
863b which is a digital identity

525
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,059
guidelines authentication lifecycle

526
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,080
management

527
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,880
so nist

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,260
um

529
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,539
is a American organization on the

530
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,100
government organization that did some

531
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,460
great work around leading practices for

532
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,740
authentication and general authorization

533
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,799
uh mechanisms and they published a set

534
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,780
of guidance which is very useful very

535
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,240
sort of well researched it's again a bit

536
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,880
uh more like a wordy document rather

537
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,740
than a set of requirements and as part

538
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,559
of developing version four we took the

539
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,480
um the concepts in that nist document

540
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,100
and broke them up into requirements that

541
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,260
then in some of the early chapters of

542
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,740
the SBS that's uh a nice link to based

543
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,240
off their research but also keep it in

544
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,919
the form of requirements that we'd like

545
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,539
to see in asbs

546
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,160
there various other mappings as well

547
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,720
which we can see on the face of the

548
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,580
standard including proactive controls

549
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,640
and cwe and there's also a cheat sheets

550
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
mapping as well which we'll see in a sec

551
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,400
the asps is designed to help comply with

552
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
PCI DSS 6.5.x we need to check where we

553
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,620
are with the most recent version of PCI

554
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,200
but in general it should help you comply

555
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,179
with that section as well the idea being

556
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,679
you know we want this to be the

557
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,059
application security standard

558
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,160
so what does it look like

559
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,640
so this is a a typical page from the

560
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,039
from the asbs

561
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,320
so we can see that up here we've got the

562
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,260
the chapter name access control a little

563
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,440
bit of text about what the chapter is

564
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,520
talking about you know what's going to

565
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,260
be what sort of requirements are going

566
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,720
to be in this in this chapter

567
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
then each chapter is split into sections

568
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,500
we try to make it sort of logically

569
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,880
numbered

570
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,580
um x dot y dot Z style numbering so it's

571
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,960
a lot easier to find okay where is this

572
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,520
requirement which section which subject

573
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,840
which section does it relate to Which

574
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,820
chapter is it in just to make it easier

575
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,740
to navigate around

576
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,820
um so we can see we've got the the

577
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,679
section heading here then we've got the

578
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,740
requirements in this particular section

579
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,600
we can see that each of these

580
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,700
requirements is a level one requirement

581
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,020
meaning that it's relevant for both for

582
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,280
level one for level two and for level

583
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,660
three if this is just a level two

584
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,880
requirement then level one here will be

585
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,780
blank

586
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,400
um because it wouldn't be relevant for

587
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,539
level one so it'd only be relevant for

588
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,059
level two and level three

589
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,820
um we can see cwe cwe is common weakness

590
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,260
enumeration

591
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,059
um it's a project from from miter to try

592
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,700
and categorize different uh security

593
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,179
weaknesses and it's that's a useful

594
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,940
mapping to say okay well you know I have

595
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,620
this here this requirements but what's

596
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,120
the what's the rationale behind this

597
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,559
requirement what what weakness what

598
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,360
issue what vulnerabilities is we is this

599
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,520
uh requirement coming to rectify

600
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,320
so having that mapping there is sort of

601
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,780
useful for that context as well

602
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,700
um very subtly down here

603
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,539
we can see a link to the OS proactive

604
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,260
controls items that uh this requirement

605
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,200
relates to uh it's just a a nice way of

606
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
mapping across the same code if I'm

607
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,620
already dealing with the proactive

608
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,419
controls which ASCS items and what

609
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,919
should I already be handling which asps

610
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,159
items should I already be uh have uh

611
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,500
have solved

612
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,539
um you may be able to use that as sort

613
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,000
of a an initial stage to say okay well

614
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,980
if I do if I want to start off with the

615
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,919
SVS and I can't do all 130 items in

616
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,260
level one where can I start and it may

617
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,480
be that you can use the items that are

618
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,799
matched to for active controls as a

619
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,419
guiding point to say well these are the

620
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,640
top 10 proactive controls so they you

621
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,799
know that uh means there's a certain

622
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,120
level of importance attached to them so

623
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,740
maybe I want to start there but that's

624
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,120
not necessarily an official position but

625
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,559
it's something to think about if you're

626
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,200
again looking at how to get to that

627
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,580
first stage of how you know how do I

628
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,139
achieve level one where do I start

629
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,820
so the status split into a set of

630
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,200
chapters and you can as you can see this

631
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,539
is quite quite comprehensive

632
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,340
various different areas covering various

633
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,260
different uh very different chapters

634
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,400
covering various different areas of

635
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,799
security sort of all the things that you

636
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,080
'd expect to see from a comprehensive

637
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,820
application security standards and again

638
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,220
each of these has sections and

639
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,480
requirements within the section that's

640
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,760
related to that particular area

641
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
ultimately all of these chapters should

642
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,400
be important for your application

643
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,500
it may be there are certain requirements

644
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,580
that

645
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,080
are out of scope in your particular

646
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
situation for whatever reason but

647
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,980
certainly as a starting point you need

648
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,799
to assume that all of the chapters are

649
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,480
going to be relevant for you so if

650
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
you've got an API you've written just

651
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,960
because there's a chapter called API web

652
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,280
service doesn't mean you don't have to

653
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,780
look at everything else your API may

654
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,820
give you certain

655
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,260
additional requirements you need to take

656
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,580
into account but ultimately all the

657
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,960
chapters should be relevant and all of

658
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
the all of the chapters have to be

659
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,740
considered for

660
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,880
for um securing your application

661
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,340
there

662
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,320
so when I'm giving a talk about the SDS

663
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,280
I deliberately don't want to start

664
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,840
talking about okay here's the standard

665
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,860
here's what's in this here's this

666
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,880
chapter here's what's in this chapter

667
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,140
and go through all the requirements it's

668
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,720
a lot of requirements as we know

669
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,919
um and it doesn't make it for super

670
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,299
interesting so what I like to do is try

671
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,860
and say okay well let's let's just pull

672
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,860
out a few a few interesting examples

673
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,039
um like I say oh loves its top tens

674
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,340
um so I sometimes talk about the osvs

675
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,380
top 10 cool features

676
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,700
um but on this occasion because I want

677
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,740
to make sure I save some time for the

678
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,659
future as well I'm going to restrict

679
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,559
myself to the OS top five cool features

680
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,000
um so here are a set of things I think

681
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,780
are

682
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,880
interesting about the asbs and sort of

683
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
demonstrate why it's an important

684
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,500
project

685
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,260
so

686
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,059
ssrf

687
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,000
is a type of vulnerability that has been

688
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,220
very prevalent over the last few years

689
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,039
now back in 2017 they released an

690
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,260
updated version they'll ask top 10 and

691
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,500
within 2018 2019 2022 we're already

692
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,700
seeing

693
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,580
widespread exploitation of issues

694
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,100
related to server side request forgery

695
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,620
but partially because it wasn't in the

696
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,940
last top 10 it didn't have the

697
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,260
prominence it didn't have the awareness

698
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,820
that

699
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,900
other

700
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,039
maybe older and better known

701
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,480
vulnerabilities had

702
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,159
and in fact there was almost a

703
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,659
discussion about whether there needed to

704
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,340
be some sort of Point release of the OS

705
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,260
top 10 some sort of interim released top

706
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,140
10 to highlight the importance of ssrf

707
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,960
now in asvs because we've been designed

708
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,760
to begin with to be a comprehensive

709
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,440
standard

710
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,140
we had that in to begin with we have

711
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,460
already had that and we had various

712
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,620
different requirements related to ssrf

713
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,659
to make sure that

714
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:13,980
you know you're thinking about this

715
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,000
issue and think about how you're going

716
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,140
to deal with this issue we don't have to

717
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,960
wait for you know another version of the

718
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
OS top 10 to come out which I think in

719
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,220
2021 that's obviously you know more more

720
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,539
significantly highlighted we didn't have

721
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:25,919
to wait for that though because we were

722
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,720
comprehensive sounded we could have all

723
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,039
the different issues and we weren't just

724
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,799
restricted to having a top 10.

725
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,240
that means anyone who's following the

726
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,679
SBS should have been aware of this issue

727
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,539
and should have been able to to combat

728
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,419
this issue and that's uh a big plus of

729
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,500
being a standard like this we didn't

730
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,380
need to uh fit ourselves into a

731
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,200
particular template to a particular uh

732
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,179
time frame and also

733
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,520
whilst the standard maintains you know

734
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,200
also maintains static versions of the

735
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,100
standard

736
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,740
the I guess the bleeding edge version is

737
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,600
always being updated with new comments

738
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,059
and uh new information if you don't need

739
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,740
to strictly comply to a standard but you

740
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,120
want to see okay what's most up to date

741
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,799
today you can also use that and that's

742
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,659
uh always there on the on the master

743
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,340
branch of the of the GitHub repository

744
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,260
so the big advantage of having this this

745
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,240
comprehensive standard and this ongoing

746
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
development of the standard

747
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,320
so we'll try to bring in sort of

748
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,000
specifically useful practices practices

749
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,820
that we see that deal with

750
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,559
very sort of well-known real-life

751
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,760
threats

752
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,000
so the idea of password reuse and

753
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,559
password staffing has been a major issue

754
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,659
over the last few years the idea that an

755
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,179
organization will get breached and a

756
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,559
list of known username and password

757
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,900
combinations will

758
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,179
get disclosed either hashed or not

759
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,580
hashed and then attackers will start

760
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,900
performing a credential Staffing attack

761
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,460
where they start trying to use these

762
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,500
breached usernames and passwords on

763
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,880
other services as well to see whether

764
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,740
they can get these valid credentials to

765
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,940
work on other services as well

766
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,440
so because of this we wanted to make

767
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,520
sure there was some sort of requirement

768
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,039
that would cover this issue and so we

769
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,860
require that

770
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,440
that organizations are looking at not

771
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,760
looking at passwords you know literally

772
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,500
obviously they don't anyone's looking at

773
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,179
the password but the system is checking

774
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,580
that the passwords aren't commonly used

775
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,100
passwords or potentially warning if a

776
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,020
password has been seen in a previous

777
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,419
breach because it's the main indicator

778
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,400
that account may get breached in your

779
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,840
application as if someone's reused an

780
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,100
application password from a different

781
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,020
application so we try to make sure that

782
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,159
we're having these sort of useful

783
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,620
practical requirements to actually deal

784
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,340
with

785
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,860
real life impact

786
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,659
um and again it's very much about making

787
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,120
sure this is a usable standard that

788
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,699
provides proactive leading practices

789
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,260
so

790
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,720
certainly when I first had a look at the

791
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,240
standard I was familiar with the uh with

792
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,460
the first three items on this slide with

793
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,919
the secure flagged HTTP only flag

794
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,539
obviously the same site flag is a little

795
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,980
bit newer

796
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,320
um but also quite well known

797
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,600
but I hadn't heard of the host prefix

798
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,980
um that was new to me when I when I

799
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,740
first started the asbs

800
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,640
but that's something that's been

801
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,919
included since uh since version four and

802
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,120
in fact

803
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,419
the idea behind the host prefix is

804
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,419
that it's if you name a cookie with this

805
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,340
particular prefix you call it a name

806
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,559
that starts off with this uh underscore

807
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,860
underscore host hyphen

808
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,779
then the browser will specifically

809
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,240
configure the cookie in the most secure

810
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,760
possible way so regardless what other

811
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,620
other attributes you specified or

812
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,480
whatever

813
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,220
um configuration you specified for that

814
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,419
cookie the browser will immediately know

815
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,240
okay because it has this prefix I need

816
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,039
to protect this cookie in a particular

817
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,779
way without having to manually set all

818
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,880
those different configurations

819
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,140
um and that's something that's still at

820
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,880
uh in theory it's sort of the rfc's

821
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,740
stage but in practice it's shipping in

822
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,720
pretty much every single browser already

823
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
and this is an example again of a sort

824
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,740
of a forward-looking leading practice

825
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,320
about that uh you know what is a good

826
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,020
protection that we can recommend

827
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,059
recommend today and maybe it's less well

828
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,220
known but will improve the overall

829
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,900
security of an application and

830
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,760
organization

831
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,260
so even though this is less well known

832
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,899
we chose this to include something that

833
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,419
we could see as being a worthy and well

834
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,580
used control well well used control and

835
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,320
well supported control

836
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,659
okay it means of by having this level of

837
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,880
granularity and having this level of uh

838
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
comprehensiveness we can make specific

839
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,500
um recommendations to build a more

840
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,220
secure application

841
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,100
so

842
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,659
you know obviously we want to deal with

843
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,580
the I guess the most well-known and the

844
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,039
most risky issues and the most uh sort

845
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,720
of widespread exploited issues but we

846
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,039
also want to think about the edge cases

847
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,840
as well we don't want to think about

848
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,640
we'll hear the top 10 issues here are

849
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,100
the top 20 issues here you know what the

850
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,539
most well-known issues you want to think

851
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,880
about slightly more more unusual issues

852
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,620
as well but it can still have a

853
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,059
significant security impact on the

854
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,679
application

855
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,740
so this particular control about

856
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,960
abnormal behavior if you imagine someone

857
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
working let's say in a call center and

858
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,100
their job is to that customers will

859
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,600
phone them up and they will look at the

860
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,980
customer's record and they'll help them

861
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,299
out or give them advice or they'll make

862
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,120
changes to the customer's record

863
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,640
and yeah that's their job you know maybe

864
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,500
they can expect to have let's say 10

865
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,539
calls an hour so if they get 10 calls an

866
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,100
hour they're probably looking at 10

867
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,020
customers now

868
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,220
and they're opening up 10 customer

869
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,539
records and they're maybe exposed to

870
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,980
sensitive data for that customer but

871
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,539
ultimately that's their job their job is

872
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,000
to see the customer sensitive data and

873
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
help them

874
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,000
yeah modify their records or perform

875
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,279
actions on their behalf

876
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,100
but what if that call center operator is

877
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,360
accessing 20 records now 30 50 100 a

878
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,120
thousand ten thousand an hour

879
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,039
now in theory they have permissions to

880
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,659
do that they have authorization to do

881
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,640
that that's theoretically it's their job

882
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
to view customer records

883
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,299
but certainly not at that volume in that

884
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,340
type period of time okay that's clearly

885
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,559
not within business expectations for

886
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,120
that person to be doing

887
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,799
and you know that's a sort of subtlety

888
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,299
you can't necessarily capture with a top

889
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,039
ten or with a okay we're just going to

890
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
focus on the um

891
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,000
the most online issues but it is an

892
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
important part of the Security

893
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,640
application you know what's happening

894
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,140
here is there's some sort of malicious

895
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,419
software on the customer service agents

896
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,640
machine that is uh pulling data out of

897
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,779
the application or is the customer

898
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,880
service operations themselves doing

899
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,500
something they shouldn't be doing or

900
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,000
perhaps using some sort of automated

901
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,020
script to pull out a lot of customer

902
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,460
information you know that sort of

903
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,720
information that comes that's the sort

904
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,020
of uh issue that is important for an

905
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,360
organization to know about but again it

906
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,700
requires this subtle understanding of

907
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,700
um what is expected what's considered

908
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,559
normal for the application the nice

909
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,820
thing about having a comprehensive

910
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,080
standard is that we can go into that

911
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,880
level of granularity and go into that

912
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,419
level of thought

913
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,720
so the fifth thing I want to pick up if

914
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,179
I uh move on

915
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,740
so a lot of the requirements are saying

916
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,880
You must do this you must do that you

917
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,520
must do the other and

918
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,340
you know that that's great but yeah

919
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,419
again we want to try and keep the

920
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,620
requirements short we can't necessarily

921
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,720
say exactly how you should do something

922
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,279
but we didn't want to just leave it as

923
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,919
do this but not say how to do that so

924
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,419
we've tried wherever possible to sort of

925
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,220
include guidance and include ideas about

926
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,080
well if you want to do this and here's a

927
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,299
way you could do it so for example

928
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:37,020
um this part of chapter nine where we

929
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,340
talk about

930
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,320
configuring transport layer security

931
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,520
securely

932
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,880
we reference a great tool from Mozilla

933
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,399
that allows for creating secure

934
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,659
configurations it gives you a whole list

935
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,640
of you know what web server you're using

936
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,840
what technology using what level of

937
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,100
configuration do you want it lets you

938
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,380
generate a configuration file for that

939
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,620
particular server software that will be

940
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,419
a secure configuration file

941
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,520
so it's not just about what you have to

942
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,020
do but it also starts giving you a

943
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,520
pointer of how you should do it and

944
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,779
that's something that we've we've tried

945
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,299
to do whatever we can and uh in

946
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,760
particular the the OS cheat sheets

947
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,200
project which is another another really

948
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,940
great OS Project you should certainly be

949
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,760
aware of which contains detailed

950
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,220
information about how to

951
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,620
um perform certain security activities

952
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,720
or do certain features in a secure way

953
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,279
so for the cheat sheets project there's

954
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,559
a mapping between asvs the cheat sheets

955
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,760
project that says for this section of

956
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,159
asvs what cheat sheets might be useful

957
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,039
to you in order to to carry this out

958
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,600
and certainly you know especially where

959
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,480
we see that leading practice Can can

960
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,580
change more dynamic in certain cases we

961
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,740
may say well you need to

962
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,120
carry this out according to current

963
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,380
leading practice where current leading

964
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,360
practice might be what's uh is currently

965
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,919
in a cheat sheet so this is another

966
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,960
great resource for not just what to do

967
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,220
but also how to do it

968
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,240
thank you

969
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,159
so how can I use it

970
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,000
um

971
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,679
I guess you know practical real world

972
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,019
use I mean the moment we've seen asvs in

973
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,159
lots of different contexts a lot of

974
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,440
organizations are using it internally to

975
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,260
drive their security uh application

976
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,940
security processes and to drive their

977
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,839
Security application security

978
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,820
assessments and we're particularly

979
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,320
seeing an uptake in public sector

980
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,879
organizations and governmental

981
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,980
organizations or government itself to

982
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,500
look at you know building regulation

983
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,879
around it and building into their

984
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,280
overall regulations for building secure

985
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,560
software and we're certainly seeing a

986
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,940
lot of take up and a lot of interest in

987
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,040
that and

988
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,679
the direction we're also seeing is is

989
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,580
that

990
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,060
not just individual organizations but

991
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,699
the SVS will hopefully start to be used

992
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,580
to as a benchmark for entire ecosystems

993
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,280
or applications or entire ecosystems of

994
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,839
uh products to say well if you want to

995
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,820
be in this ecosystem you need to comply

996
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,040
with the relevant requirements from from

997
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,800
asvs and that's uh a really great

998
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,760
direction to perform a much wider or get

999
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,040
a wide level of assurance over a wide

1000
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,420
set of applications and there are

1001
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,500
certain organizations that are in a

1002
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,460
position to

1003
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,900
um enforce that level of uh

1004
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,940
comprehensiveness and then force that

1005
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,280
level of security across a wide range of

1006
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,500
applications and it's certainly a great

1007
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,780
Trend and uh I'm hoping that soon we'll

1008
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,859
be able to talk about a particular

1009
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,780
partnership we have in that area that uh

1010
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,880
is hopefully going to lead to a wide

1011
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,920
level of security for a wider range of

1012
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,339
applications

1013
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,099
I mean in terms of specific what can we

1014
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,960
use it for

1015
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,880
so

1016
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,339
it fits a wide range of different

1017
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,680
activities in as in the sdlc and the

1018
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,300
software development life cycle maybe

1019
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
it's for either developing

1020
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
security requirements or developing

1021
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,200
requirements which are secure

1022
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,220
um

1023
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,960
it can be used to think about how do I

1024
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,119
want to design a feature to work in a

1025
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,740
secure way so what considerations only

1026
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,720
take into account can help for

1027
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,460
implementation it can help for the

1028
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,440
Practical how should I

1029
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,359
do this particular function how should I

1030
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,980
what algorithm show you to this

1031
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,060
particular function

1032
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,800
so it certainly doesn't replace your

1033
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,660
sdlc it can't tell you how to build a

1034
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,180
secure software driven lifecycle but it

1035
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,359
can be used in certain activities to

1036
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,640
yeah provide valuable guidance valuable

1037
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,380
input into account how should I do this

1038
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,140
what do I need to think about here

1039
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,900
another hospital area is procurement

1040
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,859
um

1041
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,140
and that may be trying to make sure that

1042
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,640
third-party products you're bringing

1043
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,839
into your environment or that you're

1044
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,359
using are following a security standard

1045
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,500
the following applications through your

1046
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,760
standard they're being built in a secure

1047
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,359
way another interesting

1048
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,160
way it could be used in procurement is

1049
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,960
if you're buying a security product or

1050
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,820
you're buying a security service and you

1051
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,740
want to understand well which of these

1052
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,900
requirements is this security product

1053
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,060
helping me to comply with you if this is

1054
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,579
a web application firewall which of the

1055
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,619
SVS requirements can it help with which

1056
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,140
whether it's uh which will it uh be able

1057
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,180
to enforce that's also a useful way of

1058
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,099
comparing both comparing between

1059
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,060
different products and also

1060
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,500
understanding all you know what what

1061
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,780
extra security is this bringing me

1062
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,060
and finally like I said earlier it can

1063
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,500
be used in an assessment it can be used

1064
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,839
in as a as a framework for penetration

1065
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,359
testing and

1066
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,180
also be prepared used to think about QA

1067
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,500
as well if QA are trying to think well

1068
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,260
how am I going to uh make sure that uh

1069
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,700
this new feature that's been deployed is

1070
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,380
secure it can be used as a way I think

1071
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,940
it will I might want to think about this

1072
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,380
item or this item or this requirement to

1073
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,359
make sure this requirement is the case

1074
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,160
so there are quite a wide range of ways

1075
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,160
we can we can use this and why the radio

1076
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,480
context that we can use this in

1077
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:42,780
foreign

1078
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,060
plan

1079
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,119
um

1080
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,359
what I've been speaking about up until

1081
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,180
now is how the standard is in version

1082
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,680
4.0

1083
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,260
but right now we're looking ahead we're

1084
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,540
looking to version five we recently

1085
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,480
released the roadmap for version five

1086
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,880
um which includes both a timeline and

1087
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,760
also our principles our aims what we

1088
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,780
want to see in version five

1089
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,740
so firstly

1090
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,780
in terms of time scales we are hoping to

1091
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,599
release version 5 by the end of the year

1092
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,800
um it's quite aggressive time scale

1093
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,119
there's a lot to do but we're hoping

1094
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,280
that we can uh push that forward the

1095
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,980
most recent version was released in

1096
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,680
um early 2019 the version 4.0 or most

1097
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,920
recent major version version 4.0.x was

1098
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,140
released in 2019 and we feel like you

1099
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,760
know now is the time to get an updated

1100
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,740
version out so the idea is that we'll

1101
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,320
discuss the current GitHub comments over

1102
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,320
the next couple of months uh we in

1103
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,820
theory said that we've been closed for

1104
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,380
New comments but

1105
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,420
yeah we'll uh certainly review new

1106
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,920
comments on the best efforts basis so if

1107
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,000
you start looking through now and you

1108
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,720
have

1109
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,700
key feedback then you know do open a

1110
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,839
comment and we will try and get to those

1111
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,400
as well

1112
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,040
the idea is over the course of uh August

1113
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,839
to October we'll start writing the draft

1114
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,079
for 5.0 based on the 4.0 text but

1115
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,220
obviously

1116
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,079
I mean a lot of things that are moved

1117
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,359
around and are generally uh you know

1118
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,460
tidied up obviously incorporating the

1119
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,380
results of the discussions and the open

1120
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,359
comments

1121
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:13,619
um we left three months for that because

1122
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,839
we too need to have holidays and again

1123
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,680
it's it's a it's a big big undertaking

1124
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,060
and the idea is that November December

1125
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,760
we should get comments on a draft to

1126
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,260
version 5.0 with names and then

1127
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,220
releasing at the end of the year

1128
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,440
so for 5.0 our key principles are

1129
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,940
we want to make it easier to use we want

1130
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,500
to make the standard even easier at the

1131
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,060
moment we want to lower the barrier to

1132
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,260
entry

1133
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,960
um and that involves clarifying existing

1134
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,780
requirements and making sure that

1135
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,460
um it's clear from each requirement what

1136
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,359
exactly needs to happen maybe

1137
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,520
reorganizing based on feedback and

1138
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,200
generally making sure that it's as easy

1139
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,520
as possible to understand the

1140
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,740
requirements that are there

1141
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,820
um

1142
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,740
we've had minor versions since version

1143
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,599
four but we can we've always avoided

1144
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,619
changing the meaning too much

1145
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,060
requirements because we don't want to

1146
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,700
break things across minor versions but

1147
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,400
with 5.0 we can break things if we feel

1148
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,079
it's necessary to increase the clarity

1149
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,640
of the requirements and increase the

1150
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,700
understandability of the standard

1151
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,680
um we also want to enhance the

1152
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,420
explanations on how the levels are split

1153
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,880
how they work and potentially reduce the

1154
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,619
barrier to entry maybe make level one

1155
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,500
easier to achieve because

1156
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,540
and the important thing is that an

1157
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,280
organization can get started they can

1158
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,900
get to the first level once they get to

1159
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,040
the first step it's going to be easier

1160
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,320
for subsequent levels as well we want to

1161
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,000
make that as easy as possible to achieve

1162
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,040
without compromising security and

1163
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,579
there's a fine balance there but to a

1164
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,560
certain extent we'd rather have

1165
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,300
you know we'd rather rather compromise

1166
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,220
slightly on okay this is the very

1167
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,900
minimum level of security if it means

1168
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
that a lot of organizations will take

1169
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,140
the standard and user standard more

1170
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,280
widely and uh work more closely with it

1171
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,540
the mappings are reverse different

1172
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,359
mappings we're considering moving those

1173
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,460
to sort of a different part of the uh

1174
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,839
repository just making them slightly

1175
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,780
less in your face because we want the

1176
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,280
requirements to front and center we want

1177
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,660
what you need to do straight away to be

1178
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,579
the most clear thing on the on the

1179
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:12,960
standard and as part of that we also

1180
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,280
want to streamline the document and make

1181
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,440
sure that it's as easy as possible to

1182
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,460
start using a document start

1183
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,660
understanding the document at the moment

1184
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,700
there's a a lot of a lot of surrounding

1185
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,000
text a lot of introduction text a lot of

1186
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,280
explanations and we're we're not sure

1187
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,420
how much people are using that and how

1188
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,520
much it is looking at requirements and

1189
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,520
we may want to try and prioritize or I

1190
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,980
guess emphasize requirements over the

1191
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,599
expanded text because that's the the

1192
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,099
Crux of what organizations need to

1193
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,280
follow

1194
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,099
so that's a plan five 5.0 and the

1195
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,720
question is uh how can you be involved

1196
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,460
in this

1197
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,859
so first of all user standard

1198
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,140
um version most recent stable version is

1199
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,800
4.0.3 that's all on the uh the GitHub

1200
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,560
repository you can find that uh as well

1201
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,240
as various different

1202
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,500
output formats of that version on the

1203
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,820
4.0.33 and it should also be the

1204
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,339
contents of the 4.0 directory in the

1205
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,200
master as well but you know if you want

1206
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,820
to be sure you can use that tree and

1207
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,859
that tree is stuck to version 4.0.3 and

1208
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,320
isn't being affected by any ongoing

1209
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,599
um discussions or ongoing uh work

1210
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,760
towards 5.0

1211
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,500
if you want to see the in progress

1212
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,300
version which is sort of constantly

1213
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,680
changing constantly be modified in

1214
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,540
developed to version five and you can

1215
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,060
see that in that uh in the in the master

1216
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,520
uh branch and the 5.0 directory

1217
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,020
obviously bear in mind that's a moving

1218
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,280
Target that's going to keep changing but

1219
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,960
if you want the most up-to-date guidance

1220
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,660
that's the the best place to find it

1221
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,859
um there's also various different

1222
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,260
presentations about asps in the that you

1223
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,079
can use to communicate spread the good

1224
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,960
word and um you know talk to your own

1225
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,300
organizations about asvs

1226
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,800
um thanks to Andrew vanderstock who's

1227
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,060
your created the basis for this in the

1228
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,119
beginning

1229
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,500
Josh that's

1230
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,880
perfect

1231
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,140
okay

1232
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,119
um just a couple more slides okay so

1233
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,500
sorry of course we will have a few

1234
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,060
questions just to be conscious of time

1235
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,800
so we have at least two three questions

1236
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,000
for you

1237
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,560
okay so there's a couple more slides and

1238
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,960
I'll go to questions that's okay

1239
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,280
okay

1240
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,240
um

1241
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,500
so yeah

1242
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,880
don't just use a standard contribute

1243
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,740
your ideas as well provide your feedback

1244
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,420
and

1245
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,880
um yeah you can there's in guidance on

1246
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,260
contributing at the link here you can

1247
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,240
also provide translations and also talk

1248
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,440
about how you're using it and give your

1249
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,730
feedback on how you're using it

1250
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,079
[Music]

1251
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,339
um

1252
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,020
you can also support the standard we now

1253
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,000
have a supporters program we're very

1254
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,760
grateful to uh one consult who uh of

1255
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,619
supporting SVS as a tertiary supporter

1256
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,440
and uh apiro who are supporting us as an

1257
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,300
associate supporter

1258
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,819
um and you can support the project as

1259
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,680
part of your OS corporate membership or

1260
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,180
directly there are also primary and

1261
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,099
secondary support levels

1262
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,900
um and that's it would greatly help us

1263
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,700
to to spend more time on the project and

1264
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,140
and generally increase the awareness of

1265
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,099
the project

1266
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:02,040
and there's a final point I'd like to

1267
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,020
thank our maintaining supporters who are

1268
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,280
organizations that let the project

1269
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,500
leaders work on the organization time to

1270
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,859
to keep the project moving and to make

1271
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,900
sure that we can achieve what we want to

1272
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,040
achieve the project so thank you very

1273
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,380
much to uh clarified security bound

1274
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,300
security and Mana code for for their

1275
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,900
support on that

1276
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,099
so that's the SVS

1277
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,540
um thank you very much for your time

1278
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,099
today I hope that's been a useful

1279
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,260
overview that helped you understand both

1280
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,599
what's the current state is and also

1281
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,760
what the the future plans are if you

1282
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,859
have questions feedback information you

1283
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:36,780
want to speak to me you want to get

1284
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,160
involved with the project there's a lot

1285
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,180
of links here that will hopefully help

1286
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,220
you for that and uh yeah thank you very

1287
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,759
much your time

1288
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:47,460
thank you very much Josh uh that was an

1289
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,200
amazing presentation and a lot of

1290
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,579
information so that's why we have

1291
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,420
questions and first question for you uh

1292
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,220
with the giant fast-paced development

1293
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,200
what would be the recommended

1294
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,359
verification period for a single

1295
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,319
application would it be better for

1296
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,119
asvs to also have a set of definitions

1297
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,700
of them perception based on the

1298
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,619
requirements so those can be included

1299
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,339
easily in user stories

1300
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:15,119
foreign

1301
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,400
so that's a good question

1302
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,079
I know that

1303
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:19,859
um

1304
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,560
you know ultimately the the requirements

1305
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,420
are written in a way that you should be

1306
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,460
able to read the requirement and then

1307
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,140
understand what's needed to actually

1308
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,880
comply that requirement and what you

1309
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,200
should expect to see if that requirement

1310
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,760
is being complied with

1311
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,599
what we may have in the near future

1312
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,599
um is an additional

1313
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,339
guide for the SBS there's more like a

1314
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,920
testing guide to say well if you want to

1315
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,060
verify that this requirement is being

1316
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,980
satisfied or the set of requirements are

1317
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,140
being satisfied here are specific tests

1318
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,740
you can carry out to verify this now

1319
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,920
this is there's already an OS Project

1320
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,780
which is the uh

1321
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,339
um the web app security testing guide

1322
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,920
but that's written it's sort of not

1323
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,380
written in in in in terms of verifying

1324
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,579
against the SPs it's more of a general

1325
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,560
sort of penetration testing guidance

1326
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,020
document and the idea is to have a a

1327
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,760
guide that's part of the SVS that gives

1328
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,740
more specific

1329
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,079
um tests structures but based on the SPs

1330
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,400
for how to verify that for particular

1331
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,140
requirements are being satisfied then

1332
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,819
that could be potentially used as a

1333
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,960
definition of done for a particular

1334
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,819
requirement by saying well you

1335
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,280
you know if we carry out this test is it

1336
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,440
passing successfully you know can we see

1337
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,760
this requirement has been successfully

1338
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,440
complied with

1339
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,579
um so I hope that I hope that answers

1340
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,200
the question if if it hasn't done them

1341
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,940
yet please feel free to follow up or get

1342
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,920
in touch with me afterwards

1343
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,540
thank you very much thank you Josh

1344
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,560
another question is so is this like CIS

1345
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,780
benchmarks but for code

1346
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,079
is this like CIS benchmarks but for code

1347
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,260
um

1348
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,880
don't try to give it a long or short

1349
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,260
answer

1350
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,980
um

1351
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,720
I'm going to start off with a minor dig

1352
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,060
at CIS um if you want to use CIS

1353
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,740
benchmarks you're limited in how you can

1354
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,000
use those

1355
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,599
um

1356
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,000
and there's sort of certain licensing

1357
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,740
agreements around that and you kind of

1358
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,660
use them in certain contexts whereas the

1359
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,880
SDS is uh freely licensed anyone can

1360
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,319
take it or can use it anyone can Fork it

1361
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,839
with attribution and you can do what you

1362
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,160
need to do so it's a lot more flexible

1363
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,500
from that perspective

1364
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,560
um

1365
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,119
other than that it is along the same

1366
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:25,440
sort of lines the idea is you should be

1367
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,240
able to verify particular characters the

1368
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,339
characteristics of the software

1369
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,740
um CIS benchmarks tend to be very sort

1370
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,540
of configuration focused and very sort

1371
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,520
of focused on particular technology and

1372
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,220
that lets them

1373
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,480
that makes it a little easier to sort of

1374
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,339
okay is this value set is this value set

1375
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:42,540
is this value set

1376
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,859
um in a configuration file for example

1377
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,200
it makes a lot easier to automate asps

1378
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,339
is a little bit more General because

1379
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:48,420
it's trying to look at the application

1380
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,819
as a whole so it's not quite as as clean

1381
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,819
to verify that particular requirement is

1382
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:56,700
um being correctly carried out like I

1383
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,720
said the testing guide will hopefully

1384
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,700
help for that and there's been some work

1385
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,720
to say well for some of these

1386
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,859
requirements we're going to create some

1387
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:03,480
sort of automation that can verify these

1388
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,819
requirements automatically

1389
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,140
um but it's not necessarily

1390
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,599
straightforward for every requirement

1391
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,800
but certainly in terms of the principle

1392
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,200
of you know here's the security things

1393
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,819
you know the requirements you'd expect

1394
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,680
to see from piece of software and here

1395
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,880
are the things you're going to want to

1396
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,640
verify it certainly does have a similar

1397
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,960
approach to the CIS benchmark

1398
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,880
thank you very much

1399
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,099
another question how can companies get

1400
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,380
certified against the asvs

1401
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,900
yes so this is a question I get asked a

1402
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,220
lot

1403
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,480
um

1404
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,520
and uh it's a tricky question you know

1405
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,839
there's no there is no asps

1406
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:44,400
certification you know this isn't like

1407
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,099
ISO or sock 2 you don't get a pretty

1408
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,780
document at the end or some sort of

1409
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,520
magic certificate

1410
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,020
um

1411
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,819
so you know it's not quite that

1412
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,579
straightforward I think that the the

1413
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,920
easiest way I've seen is if you already

1414
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,260
have penetration testing being performed

1415
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,940
if you can ask your tester if they can

1416
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,740
structure the test in such a way they

1417
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,700
can give you

1418
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,280
feedback on how the application performs

1419
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,800
based on the requirements of the SVS it

1420
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,000
does require a little bit more work but

1421
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,800
it can give you a slightly a penetration

1422
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,300
testing report will usually be you know

1423
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,500
this was bad this was bad this was bad

1424
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,300
this was bad and if we can replace that

1425
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,800
with the report saying well we didn't

1426
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,240
found any issues in this requirement

1427
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,440
area didn't find any issues with this

1428
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,339
requirement that we didn't find any

1429
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,140
issues or we did find an issue with this

1430
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,240
requirement because this you know we

1431
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,440
were able to do this and that gives you

1432
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,540
a far more comprehensive picture of your

1433
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,400
how the application is doing so that's

1434
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,099
uh that's one possibility

1435
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,780
um and it's possible that you know

1436
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,480
consultancies might start offering some

1437
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,780
sort of informal review against the asvs

1438
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,880
but you know there isn't an official

1439
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,920
process at the moment

1440
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,660
um but it may be work possible to work

1441
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,400
with a security consultancy to find a

1442
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,560
way of incorporating asps into a review

1443
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,960
thank you thank you for the answer and

1444
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,240
if I would like to get more in-depth

1445
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,180
information about using asvs what should

1446
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,220
I do where can I get this information

1447
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,440
um

1448
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,520
yeah so I've yeah I try and cover as

1449
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,839
much as possible here and you know I

1450
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,040
think there can be a lot of valuable

1451
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,500
information from just reading through

1452
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,359
the standard and sort of trying to

1453
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,220
understand the the requirements and you

1454
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,020
know feeling free to ask questions the

1455
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,660
slack channel is quite active and uh

1456
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,880
we're quite trying to be active on the

1457
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,380
GitHub repository as well although slack

1458
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,760
is probably more responsive in terms of

1459
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,980
simple questions

1460
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,640
um

1461
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,619
other than that

1462
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,800
um I I also deliver training sort of

1463
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,140
more in depth about using the SVS

1464
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,640
um sort of things that can't be covered

1465
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,119
in a short uh uh a short training a

1466
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,520
short uh conference session like this I

1467
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,800
do also have training that covers on a

1468
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,260
wider basis how to use asps how to take

1469
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,700
a you know how to get an application

1470
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,079
security mindset how to build security

1471
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,180
requirements

1472
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:00,839
um

1473
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,119
and then you know use the SVS as a guide

1474
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,160
for that and uh but that's that's

1475
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,420
obviously something a lot more involved

1476
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,559
and if that's something that you're

1477
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,059
interested in and you want to do some

1478
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:10,500
more in-depth training on that then you

1479
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,940
can uh you can be in contact with me and

1480
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,380
we can we can see what we can do

1481
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,780
thank you very much anything else you

1482
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,700
would like to add Josh to the end of

1483
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,540
your session so we don't have any more

1484
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,200
questions but maybe anything else on the

1485
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,660
wasp asvs

1486
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,240
um

1487
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,680
reinforce the key messages that you're

1488
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,960
number one yeah please do start using

1489
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,819
this please start uh

1490
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,200
trying to integrate this into your

1491
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,440
overall assessment and uh development

1492
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,660
processes it's certainly a there's

1493
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,640
another standard that specifically focus

1494
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,559
on applications that's like this and uh

1495
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,000
I think we're going to see more take up

1496
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,040
of this standard certainly from a

1497
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,480
regulatory perspective as we go forward

1498
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,460
so you're suddenly getting it getting

1499
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,140
ahead of that and getting starting to

1500
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,420
get sort of in the loop and start using

1501
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,099
it is going to be of a big benefit to

1502
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,260
any organization

1503
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,460
um and yeah please be involved as well

1504
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,079

00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:16,680

1511

1512
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,380

for moderating appreciate it thank you

1516
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,420
Jeff I I just wanted to ask how big is

1517
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,180
now the community how many people uh all

1518
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,760
over the world uh in your community or

1519
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,680
maybe just if you're talking about your

1520
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,059
country

1521
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,960
so we do have a list of contributors

1522
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,400
um which we sort of update with each

1523
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,400
minor release and certainly we've had

1524
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,920
probably I don't know the exact numbers

1525
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,960
some like you know 50 to 100 people

1526
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,940
who've had some contribution within the

1527
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,859
standard with that b

1528
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,660
um review or submitting suggested

1529
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,540
wording and then probably another 10 or

1530
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,339
so who've made major contributions and

1531
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:07,020
have done either a lot of review or

1532
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,940
provided a lot of content

1533
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,579
um on top of the leaders so uh yes it's

1534
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,680
certainly a large group of people you

1535
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,760
know that doesn't count people who just

1536
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,500
sort of ask questions or raised issues

1537
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,940
and issue an issues section but never

1538
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,920
actually

1539
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,300
either we've sort of committed the look

1540
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,640
at the the feedback directly or you know

1541
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,740
got discussed without actions being

1542
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,180
taken

1543
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,160
um but certainly we've always welcome

1544
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,339
more interest and more feedback as well

1545
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,619
and during Kobe did you have online

1546
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,480
sessions regular online sessions with

1547
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,760
your community or how how did it work

1548
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,800
for the community

1549
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,800
so the you know in terms of interacting

1550
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,020
with the community it's it's mostly you

1551
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,359
know there's no sort of formal process

1552
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,660
for you know ongoing uh meetings or

1553
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,400
ongoing discussions it's more the you

1554
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,200
know the asynchronous discussions in in

1555
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,059
the GitHub repository that's really you

1556
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,800
know between the GitHub repository and

1557
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,980
the slack Channel That's the uh the main

1558
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,020
venue for discussions on asps and it's

1559
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,420
pretty much done in a in an async basis

1560
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,660
I guess we could look at doing

1561
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,119
um Town Hall meetings or wider focus

1562
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,040
group meetings if necessary but uh

1563
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,200
ultimately having the sort of the ego

1564
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,880
synchronous approach and using the using

1565
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,740
the chat and using the issues I think it

1566
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,660
helps to give people tied to to you know

1567
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,980
read through the thoughts and provide

1568
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,319
their own thoughts and you know that's a

1569
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,359
wide range of people contributes so uh

1570
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,558
that seems to work quite well

1571
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:34,079
thanks that was amazing I think people

1572
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,180
found a lot of answers during the

1573
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,540
sessions uh the session and

1574
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,700
