1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,740
hi everyone and welcome to the death

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,860
secups track my name is larger fever and

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm a volunteer in the OAS community and

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll be moderating this session so

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,580
during the next 45 minutes we'll hear

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,520
John Deleo and see about the list later

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,900
talk about the OAS Sam project so please

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,880
submit any questions you have during

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,180
this session in the Q a tab and I'll be

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,340
asking our speakers your questions in

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,399
the last 10 minutes so let me introduce

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,820
John and siba John as the New Zealand

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,920
OSP chapter Elite and is on the core

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,680
team of the OS Sam project he's

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,300
currently leading the software Assurance

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,980
advisory practice at Datacom New Zealand

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,340
seba is the co-founder and CTO of toriel

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,500
he started the oaspo Belgian chapter and

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,300
was a member of the OAS Foundation board

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,320
he's also one of the co-leaders of the

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,480
Sam projects and now he's adopting

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,700
application security models to the

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,640
evolving fields of devops and has also

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,220
focused on bringing threat modeling to

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,900
the wider audience

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,180
and with that I will hand over the world

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,119
the world the world the world to John

28
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,060
and Siva take it away guys

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,659
thank you Lars hi John where is all

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,299
right so uh thank you uh thank you all

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,820
for joining uh joining this track we'll

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,119
uh we'll be uh talking about an hour and

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,420
demoing uh the some project and um as

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,600
large sets don't be afraid to uh to put

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,060
your questions in the chats uh or on the

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,119
Rover uh I would say application uh

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,640
we'll leave enough room and we'll uh

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,820
we'll take about uh 40 minutes or so to

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,159
present the project and demo the project

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,280
and we'll leave enough room for Q a

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,299
so with that I'll be sharing my screen

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,700
if everything goes fine you should be

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,340
able to see a presentation

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,979
which I'm going to start right now

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,000
so we're going to present to you the the

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,780
project called owasp sum now

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,140
um John was already presented by John

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,959
at myself

49
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,060
so our contact details are also on the

50
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,620
last slide so if you want to reach out

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,200
to John or myself don't don't hesitate

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,660
to do that

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,120
but we're here for uh uh for some so

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,640
what is some actually some some is a

55
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
What's called the software Assurance

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,379
maturity model so it's a maturity model

57
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,420
that really provides a effective and

58
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,519
above all measurable way for all types

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,099
of organizations to not only analyze

60
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,080
where you are in terms of software

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,319
security practices but also to improve

62
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,400
that and that's really where some shines

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,500
it makes what you're doing in your

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,159
appsec uh pipelines in your CI CD

65
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,280
pipelines measurable it makes it

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,319
actionable it's really provides you with

67
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,319
a lot of pointers to what you can do

68
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,659
um and also understand that some itself

69
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,200
is is versatile and and like technology

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,959
process or organization agnostic so it

71
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,800
can obviously apply this on a devops uh

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
practice but even for a waterfall or

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,860
agile or other ways of programming some

74
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,260
is definitely something you can and

75
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,260
should use as I would say the open

76
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,540
source secure development life cycle

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,280
framework

78
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,560
um everything we show here and also show

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,200
that afterwards is also available on our

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,319
website or waspsan.org

81
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,780
um anything to add to that John

82
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,540
no well I think you did mention about

83
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,180
how it's

84
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,720
its most beneficial as a tool for

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,640
figuring out how you're going to improve

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,099
your posture

87
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,380
one of the things I find

88
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,839
we often have to help people understand

89
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,139
is that you go through a Sam assessment

90
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,479
not to obtain some objective score or

91
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,400
get a stamp of approval hang something

92
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,500
on the wall it's really to understand

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,540
where you are now and you understand

94
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,460
where you are now so you can decide

95
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,860
where you'd like to be in six months in

96
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,199
12 months and that's really what's

97
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,759
important and

98
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,780
how the Sam framework is most valuable

99
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
yeah exactly thanks thanks for adding

100
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,979
that

101
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,620
um now why do we need such a thing as

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,500
some uh and you're all joining the I

103
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,900
would say the OAS uh our Tech conference

104
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,300
so you're aware of of uh adding security

105
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,220
activities to a skill developed life

106
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,520
cycle but it's really about okay how do

107
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,280
we do that how do we when we look at

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,740
designing building testing and and

109
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,840
deploying software in a production

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,600
environment how can we add more

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,540
proactive security controls to the to

112
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,620
those pipelines or your process where uh

113
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,660
certainly I would say the less mature or

114
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,340
people who is just starting with

115
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,080
security start with like with pen

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,139
testing or scanning their codes and then

117
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,780
patching that a more proactive way is

118
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,220
looking okay how what kind of

119
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,820
requirements do I need to uh address or

120
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,860
include in my user stories or my next

121
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,660
stories what kind of threat modeling

122
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,759
should I do coding guidelines and so

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,740
there's lots of activity it is that you

124
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
can end and you should add really as

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
part of your development especially also

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,940
the devops as that's much quicker in

127
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,520
terms of like timing and frequency than

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,800
the more traditional way of programming

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
it's really crucial to embed those

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
activities those security activities as

131
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
part of the development process

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
well that's that's the whole background

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,199
of why we need a more structured way of

134
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,419
deciding okay what kind of activities do

135
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,220
we need to add and where do we add them

136
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,900
in what kind of order do we need to add

137
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,060
that where are we really in terms of

138
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,120
like security activities and that's

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,400
where where some comes into place and

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,960
then to play

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,180
and it's a maturity model

142
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,479
um and why is it a maturity model so

143
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,940
actually there's a couple of aspects

144
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,460
that we need to take into account when

145
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,800
you start adding security activities to

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,060
the secure development or to a

147
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,759
development lifecycle any life cycle

148
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,520
um it introduces change you going to

149
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,199
change a little bit how you're going to

150
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,360
work within your devops team or

151
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,340
development team or your squad or

152
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,500
whatever and scope that you're working

153
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,960
on and so change is something that you

154
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
don't do overnight so you need to have

155
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
like an iterative way of changing the

156
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,020
way that you're working you're not going

157
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,240
to do everything different from one day

158
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,500
to the other

159
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,380
also you need to understand that

160
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,900
when you look at some later on there's

161
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,600
lots of stuff that you can do and

162
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,220
there's I would say there's guidance

163
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,560
especially also on the website but there

164
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,520
is no single way of doing this so it is

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,560
not like you need to do this first and

166
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,419
that and then to so there's there's

167
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,240
different uh ways to leading you to the

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,280
maturity level that you need to get to

169
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,039
or want to get to uh and what's key

170
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,539
there is that and that's something

171
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,940
that's built into the model

172
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,699
is that it should be risk-based so based

173
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,819
on your software risk profile your risk

174
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,979
appetite you should look at okay what's

175
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,139
enough in terms of activities for us as

176
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,680
a team or as an organization

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,139
and also there's uh you need to

178
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,840
understand and not only yourself as as I

179
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,419
would say as a as a developer in the

180
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,060
team but also as a product owner or as a

181
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,280
stakeholder as a business analyst okay

182
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,500
what do we need what are we adding here

183
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,139
especially and there in this case the

184
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,000
framework the sum framework provides

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,460
enough information to actually describe

186
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,440
what kind of activity that you can or

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,819
should be adding

188
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,280
and what makes some especially

189
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
interesting as a maturity model is that

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,560
it's it makes your activities what

191
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,660
you're going to add measurable in terms

192
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,800
of maturity

193
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,259
and and that is really about like if you

194
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,720
can measure it you can manage it and

195
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,659
that's where where some helps you to

196
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,059
measure where you are and helps you to

197
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,580
create a roadmap and to also to

198
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,039
demonstrate that you're improving the

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,620
way of of working

200
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,020
and that that's a key aspect to that

201
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,240
that from your side just chip in

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,399
we actually we had the Sam Community

203
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,959
call

204
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,140
what was this morning for me last night

205
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,500
um in Europe and the question was asked

206
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,480
okay we did a baseline assessment what

207
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,600
what does Sam tell us to work on next

208
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,820
and it all comes back to that second

209
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,640
bullet it depends

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,060
um what does your organization perceive

211
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,540
as your biggest areas of risk what are

212
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,820
those areas that your

213
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,580
your c-suite that your board are most

214
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,160
concerned about seeing Improvement in

215
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,040
because they'll drive your priorities

216
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,640
and ultimately as as was pointed out by

217
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,399
one of the participants this morning

218
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,220
all of this is about driving down risk

219
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,580
so you're going to use Sam as a

220
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,339
framework to help you understand where

221
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,760
you have gaps and then look at how

222
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,860
closing those gaps can help improve your

223
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,200
risk posture so

224
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,420
there is no one answer it's very much

225
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,680
based on what's going on in your

226
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,300
organization your industry

227
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,600
neat all right so a little bit of

228
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
background history uh so wherever it

229
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,480
came from so originally uh some started

230
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,120
as open some was created by a very smart

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,700
guy pravier Chandra about like already

232
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,540
13 years ago uh donated by him and at

233
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,420
the time then called 45 to Olas

234
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,040
Foundation

235
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,500
um and then uh within ovas we we took

236
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,620
that over and we started to work on the

237
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,180
project itself and improving it and

238
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,980
hence the the name change it's now

239
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,920
really called o wasp sum we've added a

240
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,660
couple of like uh updates version 1.1 we

241
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,940
did some drastic changes in the way of

242
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,120
scoring which resulted in version 1.5

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,300
and then we did a complete revamp of the

244
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,000
sum structure and framework towards to

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,040
the to the low which we're working on

246
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,220
since uh 2020.

247
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,680
now how does it look like so we've

248
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
organized all the different activities

249
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,860
in security practices that are really

250
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,600
grouped in what we call business

251
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
functions and business functions are how

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,160
do you organize the different security

253
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,380
activities as part of a governance

254
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,140
business function how do you add design

255
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,940
activities how do you add

256
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,700
implementations activities verification

257
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,040
obviously you want to have a lot of test

258
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,320
and very verification in there and

259
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
obviously also how you operate your

260
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,620
software and the Social Security

261
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,779
activities in there so there's five what

262
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,360
we call business functions and in each

263
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,100
of these business functions you have

264
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,040
three security practices and so for

265
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,320
instance strategy and metrics is

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,079
something that belongs in governance or

267
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,360
for instance requirements or security

268
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,640
testing is something that that fits into

269
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,399
the verification business function and

270
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,120
so in total we have 15 security

271
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,160
practices and each of these security

272
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,519
early practices are made there's a

273
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,579
security activities in there that we and

274
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,920
that you can and should I would say

275
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,980
consider to add to your way of working

276
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,440
some of them might be very useful some

277
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,839
of them might be less useful for you so

278
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,160
it really depends on what you're

279
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
developing and what kind of risk profile

280
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
that you're working on

281
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,660
now if we blow that up and blow that up

282
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,540
even bigger

283
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,000
towards you then you see that in these

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,680
five business functions the governance

285
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,839
the implementation and so on you have

286
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,640
the security practices and each of the

287
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,339
security practices has to or have what

288
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,380
we call two streams these are activities

289
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,480
like for instance if you look at

290
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,420
security testing here at the bottom

291
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,180
right you have a scalable Baseline

292
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,579
that's like adding like Automation and

293
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,639
testing uh to your to your CI CD

294
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
Pipeline and for instance also deep

295
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,260
understanding so this is manual testing

296
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,380
for to look for security issues in your

297
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,260
in your code and so you see that each of

298
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,600
the security practices is built out of

299
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,660
two strings

300
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,279
um then if we

301
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,860
so for each of these activities we have

302
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,899
a clear objective what do we want to get

303
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,240
out of that what's the benefit of doing

304
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,600
that a description obviously of of that

305
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,980
activity yeah for instance like security

306
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,839
testing what is it uh there's pen

307
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,980
testing in there with a clear

308
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,180
description

309
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,459
and also question a question about okay

310
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,620
how do are you're doing this because

311
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,940
later on

312
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,160
remember this is a maturity model you

313
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,680
need to be able to see okay are we doing

314
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,139
this activity or not

315
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,880
um and something that came with to the

316
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,579
low we also added quality criteria to

317
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,579
make sure that indeed you are verifying

318
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,700
the correct maturity level of your

319
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,260
activity

320
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,779
if you do a deep dive on security

321
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,339
practice uh structure here in this case

322
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,079
the control verification of the misuse

323
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,540
of use testing

324
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,820
this is the part of the requirements

325
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,100
driving the requirements driven testing

326
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,600
so this is part of the business function

327
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,060
verification so there's two streams in

328
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,959
there

329
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,959
so how does this work we have the

330
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,720
maturity level there's three maturity

331
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,459
levels actually there's four maturity

332
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,160
levels and so on there's a zero zero

333
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,480
you're not doing it

334
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,720
which is which can be valid but in most

335
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
the case you should be doing something

336
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
in this case like requirements driven

337
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,480
testing uh yours your software has to

338
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,980
have like probably some security

339
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,959
building that you have to have an ID

340
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,519
somewhere okay what kind of security

341
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,920
that's the requirements part and that's

342
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,380
actually another security practice that

343
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,300
can drive this and there's then the

344
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,760
three levels so level one is more like

345
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,480
the very ad-hoc activity of uh often

346
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,760
verifying your security requirements in

347
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,380
a way that they are implemented in your

348
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,860
software level two is that you're doing

349
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,380
this in a more structured way and you're

350
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,360
also tying it really to the kind of

351
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
software and the requirements that are

352
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,079
important for your software and so and

353
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,360
that's in general also the level two

354
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,459
maturity uh of the other security

355
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,220
practices as well and level three is

356
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,440
that actually have a feedback loop and

357
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,940
that you learn from what you're doing

358
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,860
and that's the highest level of maturity

359
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,260
uh typically there is also links and

360
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,800
ties to other parts in the model

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,699
um

362
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,699
and let me also be clear in most of the

363
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,399
cases a lot of organizations don't need

364
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,459
to get to a level three it might be that

365
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,180
for you level one is more than enough uh

366
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,940
to uh for your your piece of software

367
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,040
your functionality in terms of what

368
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,279
you're doing and that's enough depending

369
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,839
on the kind of software that you're

370
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,120
building if if it's a bit of software

371
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,420
that controls a nuclear reactor

372
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,240
yeah probably might need to get to a

373
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,940
level two or three uh if it's to order

374
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,160
software as if it's software to order

375
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,920
lunches to order sandwiches over lunch

376
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,560
for your colleagues and you're only

377
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,720
using it internally

378
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,820
okay you see that the risk profile is

379
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,339
much much lower so and that's very where

380
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,440
you will have to adapt the level of

381
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,480
maturity towards the risk profile of

382
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,579
your software so that's the maturity and

383
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,740
we're going to measure always a maturity

384
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,380
level of your security practices

385
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,079
now what we see here is we have the two

386
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,880
streams in this case security

387
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
requirements driven or requirements

388
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,600
driven testing there's two streams in

389
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,920
there there's more what we call like

390
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,380
positive stream like we verify

391
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,420
descriptive controls that we've built in

392
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,339
like are actually doing authentication

393
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,279
and so on uh there there are there's a

394
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,600
second stream that's more like the

395
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,399
misused abuse testing that's more

396
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,820
focused like confuzzing uh doing abuse

397
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,980
case testing and so on

398
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,959
um we're not going to explain in detail

399
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,820
how the security practice works here

400
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,399
there's a full one or two day training

401
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,280
if you want to I would say do that but

402
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
that's the structure you have two

403
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,540
streams and then each of these streams

404
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,839
have the activities in their uh that are

405
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,179
described to their own objective and

406
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,579
their own related question to that

407
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,160
specific activity in that security

408
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,199
practice stream

409
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,919
so that's actually how the overall

410
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,380
structure of security practice works and

411
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,880
if you understand this you understand

412
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,860
the model and because the model really

413
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,440
is built out of these 15 uh different

414
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,080
security practices and each of them have

415
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,720
these obviously three levels the streams

416
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,440
and the activities explained

417
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,039
anything else I've missed here John

418
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,900
well there's just one detail I wanted to

419
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,419
pick up on as as you were talking about

420
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,039
and we've talked a couple times about

421
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
for your organization your target may

422
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,840
not be level three in a given stream or

423
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
within a given practice

424
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,320
one of the wonderful things about

425
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,260
working with Sam is that it gives you

426
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,960
these activities to talk about

427
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,840
and when I'm doing a guided assessment

428
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,820
with an organization I'm saying in each

429
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,740
of these activities how are you doing

430
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,220
this now what what do you have in place

431
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,620
and then really there's the question is

432
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,820
what you're doing in your opinion good

433
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,860
enough to meet your needs

434
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,059
so that even when you decide we're not

435
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,559
going to implement that activity we're

436
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,059
not going to worry about in particular

437
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,580
say one of these level three activities

438
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,520
you've made that intentional decision

439
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,020
having thought about your current state

440
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,660
and what you really need

441
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,840
rather than it's simply being a sin of

442
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
omo mission that we just never really

443
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,740
thought about it so we're not doing it

444
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,799
and even that is a big value ad for an

445
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,140
organization to have made the conscious

446
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,000
decision and to have that their

447
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
reasoning captured

448
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
exactly all right yeah thank you

449
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,320
so I also uh already mentioned questions

450
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,780
uh so I'll show you how that uh how we

451
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,299
can find back those questions so here we

452
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,340
see and there's an assessment toolbox

453
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,460
toolbox is a like a a nice name for

454
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,380
actually a spreadsheet we also now have

455
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,080
now a an application for that which will

456
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,299
John will show as well

457
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,039
um but so for each level and each

458
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,140
activity there's a certain question and

459
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,539
there's quality criteria that that

460
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,700
support those questions and there's also

461
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,220
like I said I'll demonstrate this the

462
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,559
the toolbox uh just after the

463
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,679
presentation but then also a web app a

464
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,179
single page we have up but John can

465
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,679
explain how what it what it's about

466
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,740
foreign sure so

467
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,220
my team and as with Lars mentioned when

468
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,260
I was introduced I'm at Datacom New

469
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,419
Zealand and then within the organization

470
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,100
I'm actually in the application Security

471
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Services team so we do internally we

472
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,140
help our teams make sure that they've

473
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,600
got these practices in place and then

474
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,760
externally I lead

475
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,000
the software Assurance practice and we

476
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,179
do a lot of Sam assessments now one of

477
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,400
the things that

478
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,539
I have always wanted for us to have is

479
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,299
the ability to move away from an Excel

480
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,559
workbook and to a web-based tool

481
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,980
that would let us do assessments

482
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,860
on our browser and then within an

483
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,900
organization to pull those assessments

484
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,120
into a central repository be able to

485
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
look at them

486
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,260
look at them on a dashboard and and then

487
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,260
also look at assessments over time

488
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,720
well the first piece of that is to get a

489
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
UI and I was able to get some release

490
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
time within my team to put together a

491
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,400
minimum viable product

492
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,840
of a single page application UI for

493
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,500
entering an assessment this is

494
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,860
no more functionally than one of the

495
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,620
tabs in the Excel workbook currently but

496
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,240
it's there as a starting point to try

497
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,580
and get to some of these more broad

498
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,760
Enterprise features so toward the end of

499
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,740
our session I'll go through a brief demo

500
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,200
of what the app currently is and does

501
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,700
yeah

502
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,480
all right great and thanks for that

503
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,620
um

504
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,400
so it typically starts with the

505
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,780
assessment so there's a quick start

506
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,700
guide there's a quick start guide also

507
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,559
I'll go through that over the website

508
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,720
but typically the assessment is not the

509
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,940
goal uh the goal is to reach or to

510
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,940
improve your overall maturity over a

511
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,380
certain a certain couple of points so

512
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,659
you set the target you define a plenty

513
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,000
of implement to roll it out I'll show

514
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,919
you uh in a couple of minutes on the

515
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,600
website there's more detail to actually

516
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,280
do that so there's guidance there as

517
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,720
well

518
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,900
where can we all find this uh everything

519
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,539
in terms of documents presentations

520
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,020
trainings we have a shared Google Drive

521
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,240
everything in terms of projects

522
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,320
um I would say underpinning materials

523
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,940
are in GitHub and actually also the

524
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,539
website is a is a GitHub website built

525
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,059
actually uh automatically from every

526
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,820
change that we do on the model it will

527
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,159
generate the the website and everything

528
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,039
else and obviously the the website

529
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,120
itself

530
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,799
now

531
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,159
it's uh it's something that actually

532
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,100
helped us a lot to generate the or to

533
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,620
create the updated version of some and

534
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,720
also to create I would say follow-up

535
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,820
releases because we're not only at 2.0

536
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,799
we're at actually a two-loaded form

537
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,580
every time we see a typo or we need to

538
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,200
fix something for instance there was a

539
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,539
small book in the Excel spreadsheet we

540
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,600
can now push that through the GitHub uh

541
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
and then release that through a small

542
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,100
releases

543
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,679
um from from the GitHub towards the

544
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,320
different channels the the website the

545
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,720
toolbox the applications and so on

546
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,360
uh so I'll show that later on there's a

547
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,000
whole every I have our own devops I

548
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,760
would say uh it's like it's like we're

549
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,100
not releasing every day that's not but

550
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,000
we have our own uh CI CD Pipeline and

551
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
underpinning the framework these are all

552
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,440
yaml files if we do change there it's

553
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,260
pushed uh and it's pushed in the GitHub

554
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,320
and committed there's a verification in

555
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,840
terms of formatting the markdown has

556
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,700
been being generated to push towards the

557
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,500
website it's being built and deployed

558
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,020
then also towards the website as well so

559
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,780
it's something to uh that helps is a lot

560
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,320
a lot to iterate or update the model

561
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,600
much faster than in the past

562
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,840
also we're working on translating the

563
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,240
website itself and the model itself to

564
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,039
different languages so there's different

565
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,100
translations ongoing uh we're using the

566
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,080
crowning platform for that and if you're

567
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,720
watching this and you're

568
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,659
um and your and you speak one of these

569
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,220
languages or you want to have at least

570
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,600
some translate in one of your own

571
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,460
languages in your own organization or

572
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,620
your own country feel free to reach out

573
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,600
to us we're more than happy to

574
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,460
facilitate that once we have a full

575
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,440
translation of the model we'll also make

576
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,539
the website uh multi-language so that

577
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,159
you can toggle between the different

578
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,860
languages

579
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,740
I also pointed out a little bit we have

580
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,500
uh we have full training slides but you

581
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,679
also have a train the trainer package so

582
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,480
if within your organization you have

583
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,940
multiple people or multiple teams uh

584
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,559
that you want to have trained on this

585
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,200
and also feel free to reach out to their

586
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,720
advice is there as well uh I'll point

587
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
you in the Google drive to the materials

588
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,840
um

589
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,179
and last but not least so once you're

590
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,780
starting to uh to work on some yourself

591
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,760
you'll also have probably the question

592
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,860
coming up like okay that's all good and

593
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,780
fine we know where we are we know where

594
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,539
we want to get but how do I compare to

595
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,760
others well I'll do a compared to my

596
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,880
peers and that's the sum Benchmark track

597
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,120
and Brian glass who um who is over oh

598
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,640
he's already videos for I would say the

599
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,860
most part of the project

600
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,140
um has quite some experience with with

601
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,600
that those kind that kind of task he's

602
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,460
in has been involved in the OS top 10

603
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,760
also to gather all those data points

604
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,520
um and so he's working on the first MVP

605
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,820
of a some Benchmark now for the 10

606
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,679
Benchmark actually where we'll be able

607
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,860
to compare ourselves to uh I would say a

608
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,799
minimal data set of other measurements

609
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,740
for other organizations we need to

610
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,440
bootstrap that so

611
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,279
if you have uh and if you can have your

612
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,480
own or you can share your own data set

613
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,760
please reach out to Brian uh at this

614
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,760
stage he is accepting data sets uh by

615
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,460
email uh but obviously once we have a

616
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,880
minimal critical uh amount of data sets

617
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,820
uh they will be pushed in towards the

618
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,240
The Benchmark repository obviously in an

619
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,520
anonymized way but then we can start to

620
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,159
compare ourselves to The Benchmark data

621
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,480
sets

622
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,779
his contact details are here

623
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,520
um and that's also I would say a common

624
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,059
uh request for for input and feedback uh

625
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,039
we have a core project team that's

626
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,400
working on the project itself

627
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,799
um but uh we count and we use and we

628
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,840
um and we really call upon Community

629
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,960
feedback so every time you have you find

630
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,659
the possible Improvement or a book or

631
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,700
something you want to add or in terms of

632
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,539
guidance uh you're much much welcome to

633
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,460
share that with us to the different

634
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,740
channels that that we have and we take

635
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,960
that into account as well foreign

636
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,279
references to the different parts of the

637
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,240
model uh adding more uh like an online

638
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,419
version of the of this assessment tool

639
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,340
hopefully also integrated with that

640
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,559
Benchmark data

641
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,980
um also count on mapping some of the I

642
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,840
would say activities on security

643
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,940
controls that are typically part of

644
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,880
regulations and so on also each year we

645
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,580
organize some user summit we're probably

646
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,480
going to use do one this fall or Autumn

647
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,120
together with the San Francisco Global

648
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
abstract so those are the plans for the

649
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,980
future

650
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,039
um with that uh so we have a slack

651
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,159
Channel we have our GitHub uh page

652
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,960
that's those are the ones really where

653
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,500
we can capture that and let me

654
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,380
also push towards so if you want to get

655
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,659
updates there's a newsletter

656
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,419
we've not done this alone and besides

657
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,700
Stone and uh and myself we have lots of

658
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,320
other people from other parts in the

659
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,140
world uh that I've contributed to this

660
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,880
this is quality but it's also of other

661
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,700
volunteers as well very grateful also

662
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,440
for the Nations of our sponsors and if

663
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,140
you want to sponsor us uh obviously

664
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,440
you're more than welcome to do that

665
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,020
and with that let me

666
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,679
go to the website itself

667
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,659
so the best part to start is I was Dot

668
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,760
awesome.org and there you'll end up on

669
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,059
the on this home page now

670
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,940
here you'll find the

671
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,340
the different steps typically that you

672
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,620
can do so getting started doing an

673
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,179
assessment compare yourself with the

674
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,340
Benchmark but also you'll find the model

675
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,940
right so the bundle itself is here uh

676
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,919
here you can see the full model you have

677
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
five business functions uh for instance

678
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,640
here if you look at the governance

679
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,460
education guidance you have the

680
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,900
different streams so there's three

681
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,820
training and awareness there's a street

682
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,400
organization and culture and if you go

683
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,620
through that you can see the different

684
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,799
maturity levels of and activities in

685
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,840
that so maturity level one education

686
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,159
guidance basic awareness training

687
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,500
role-based training and a level two uh

688
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,399
having a security knowledge overall and

689
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,919
a formal training program and and so on

690
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,179
is a level three

691
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,760
so that's actually how you can browse

692
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,740
through the model itself

693
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,840
now

694
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,720
how do you do that uh and how do you

695
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,020
start that like I said in the beginning

696
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,059
if you go to the home page the getting

697
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,539
started is actually where

698
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,399
you should get started if you're new to

699
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,399
some and here you have at the bottom of

700
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,500
the the different steps that I pointed

701
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,779
out so you have to prepare yourself

702
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,460
so there's different activities

703
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,220
resources there you can assess where you

704
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,980
are you set your targets and so on so

705
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,559
the different steps are explained in

706
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,880
here

707
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,220
so that's I would say the the most

708
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,140
important parts of the of the website

709
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,940
itself

710
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,279
on how to do that the model there's

711
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,559
guidance here as well especially for

712
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,399
instance also on agile if you want uh we

713
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,440
have a couple of community related Pages

714
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,320
where one of the most important ones is

715
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,919
that frequently asked questions uh so if

716
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,960
you have a certain question and that you

717
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,820
think should be on there feel free to

718
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,960
shout out as as well now the best way to

719
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,840
reach out to us is through slack and

720
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,580
here's a direct link to the slack

721
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,700
Channel if you're not on the oasp slack

722
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,380
workspace yet there is a link in here to

723
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,840
actually get an invitation so uh

724
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,399
once it's reload you can fill in your

725
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,440
email address you get an invite you'll

726
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,860
get invited to the slack workspace and

727
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,600
they're actually

728
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,020
there's project Dash sum

729
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,080
obviously immediately started in your

730
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,940
slack workspace then you'll be it will

731
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,120
be easier for you to find it back but

732
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,460
here actually is where I would say the

733
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,580
most part of our community is active uh

734
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,520
and where if you have any questions you

735
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,279
can post them here and there's much much

736
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,700
interaction not only that if you go here

737
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,840
at the top

738
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,179
of that slack Channel

739
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,320
you have four paint URLs so yeah

740
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,480
obviously you have the website but you

741
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,360
also have the GitHub

742
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,500
page where we have the different

743
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,720
underlying uh repositories and we have

744
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,640
the core repository with all the yaml

745
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,500
files and anytime you change something

746
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,380
there it's uh it's pushed towards the

747
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,659
website here you can also find back the

748
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,279
latest release

749
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,399
uh actually we're on 2.0.4

750
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,620
and actually here and I'll show you

751
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,120
later on you can also download the

752
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,899
latest toolbox or spreadsheet

753
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,299
with that you also have the Google Drive

754
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,000
which is on the top uh part here and the

755
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,860
Google drive this is a shared Google

756
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,299
Drive where you find all presentations

757
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,919
uh fast repository of user days some

758
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,539
Summits mappings the roadmap and so on

759
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,299
so also some training here as well so we

760
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,039
did recently did some trailings but they

761
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,779
also have a train to train a package

762
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:50,100
also available here for your much if you

763
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,440
want to do that within your organization

764
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,440
obviously feel free to do that but make

765
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,020
sure to read the review first which is

766
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,539
in here

767
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,399
and then last but not least

768
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,260
um and we'll probably hopefully also be

769
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,440
adding this uh recording to our YouTube

770
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,200
channel as well but we do have a lot of

771
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,140
YouTube channel with past recordings and

772
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,440
sessions so make sure you subscribe to

773
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,960
that and hit that Bell that you get like

774
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,659
a notification whenever we release

775
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,440
something new so that's actually how uh

776
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,240
I will tell you the overall set of

777
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,360
documents uh and features and tools are

778
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,760
available now

779
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,399
as a last part of what I wanted to show

780
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,500
and then I'll give the word to John

781
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,320
the sum assessment itself how do you do

782
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,640
that there's different ways to do that

783
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,480
but here is a link to a self-assessment

784
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,279
Microsoft Excel toolbox this is actually

785
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,260
the one that you should be downloading

786
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,360
this is pointing to the latest release

787
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,080
in uh in uh in the GitHub and once you

788
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,380
download that you'll have downloaded the

789
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,500
toolbox or this Excel spreadsheet now it

790
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,679
has like a front page and then there's a

791
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,000
couple of tabs in there there's the

792
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,159
interview tab scorecard roadmap and

793
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,560
roadmap chart how does it work if you

794
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,960
for instance go to education and

795
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,099
guidance

796
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,520
uh do your do your employees or your

797
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,679
staff members do they have like uh

798
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,080
training well maybe at least half of

799
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,159
them

800
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,980
um is a training customized here this is

801
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,899
linked to the second activity measured

802
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,520
bladder two

803
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,639
um activity well maybe for some do you

804
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,739
have a learning management system and do

805
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,119
you track every training or

806
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,280
certification well maybe you don't oh

807
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,980
that's not interesting not bad uh no

808
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,500
worries so once you've fill this in you

809
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,000
see that there's a rating popping up

810
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,940
here actually this is our maturity level

811
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,760
the maturity level of the first stream

812
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,980
of education and guidance

813
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,619
so if we also fill in organizational

814
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,900
culture for instance you have security

815
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,480
champions for at least half of your

816
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,060
teams and you have a software second

817
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,880
software security Center of Excellence

818
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,240
for the entire organization maybe like

819
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,160
imagine that and we started implementing

820
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,020
a centralized portal

821
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,880
then you filled in the security practice

822
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,520
of relegation and guidance and you know

823
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,700
that you're at the maturity of 1.25 out

824
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,859
of a maximum of three that's actually

825
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,720
how you do your assessment

826
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,060
and that's the I would say true that

827
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,460
through that spreadsheet there's also a

828
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,800
scorecard where you can then uh look at

829
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,200
how that reflects obviously we've only

830
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,300
filled in one

831
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,960
um I would say one security practice so

832
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,599
that's not much going on there but here

833
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,339
in the roadmap you can also start

834
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,760
working on improving that in later

835
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,200
cycles and once you have do that they've

836
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,480
done that you also have your roadmap

837
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,280
chart that's going to change

838
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,540
but in a nutshell how that toolbox Works

839
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,859
um obviously much more information

840
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,740
available our trainings or if you want

841
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,200
to figure out or more details John is

842
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,760
one of our next Community calls

843
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,800
that's really what I wanted to show and

844
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,560
I think uh let's hand it over to John

845
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,020
Johnny Virgo so a couple of comments

846
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,619
before I jump over to sharing my screen

847
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,920
um on the the Excel workbook and you

848
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,140
notice the road map

849
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,960
basically it just uh go to the the

850
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,300
roadmap tab I think it's the thing I was

851
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,680
thinking about

852
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,339
um

853
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,040
by default you see that there's a phase

854
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,740
one phase two phase three phase four and

855
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,560
the way that the workbook is set up is

856
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,160
that unless you change something here

857
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,540
The Assumption is that you're mature

858
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,740
you're not going to change the way

859
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,240
you're doing things so the maturity will

860
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
stay steady

861
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,900
so that just kind of shows you if we

862
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,579
keep doing what we're doing we'll stay

863
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,440
at this level that makes sense

864
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,260
if I decide if you then decide we want

865
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,560
to set up a phased roadmap and you might

866
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,200
decide the first phase is three months

867
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,700
the second phase is the next three

868
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,440
months you can set whatever timelines

869
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,060
you want for these

870
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,460
and then you decide what you would like

871
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,099
for your

872
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,359
coverage to become by the end of that

873
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,880
roadmap phase and then you can see the

874
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,400
conditional formatting is set up so that

875
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,920
if you're targeting an improvement it

876
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,220
turns green if you're predicting a

877
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,280
reduction it will actually turn red to

878
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,220
show that you're expect you're actually

879
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,780
planning or predicting a reduction in

880
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,359
maturity and it allows you then to look

881
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,040
and see how

882
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,920
across the phases of of your roadmap

883
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,640
where you've got improvements planned

884
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,260
and one of the things that

885
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,180
um you saw was like the very first FAQ

886
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,000
question was do I have to get to one out

887
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,880
of one at level one before I start level

888
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,119
two and I would say a pretty emphatic no

889
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,060
if you're if you recognize your Baseline

890
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,579
is that we're at about half of the first

891
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,700
activity in the level one activity and

892
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,900
we're not really doing the level two

893
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,920
activity

894
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,619
then you could look at this as kind of a

895
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,079
diffusion model and say we're going we

896
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,940
want to get from in the level one

897
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,619
activity you want to get from about half

898
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,800
to almost everybody's doing it while at

899
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,560
the same time introducing the level two

900
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,079
activity to those who've already been

901
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,700
doing the level one

902
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,280
and that way you can have this kind of a

903
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,579
wave as the more mature practices

904
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,579
diffuse through the organization

905
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,200
and the other comment I wanted to make

906
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,880
was about the Train the trainer which of

907
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,220
which I am somewhat proud

908
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,920
so the idea is that we have a one day

909
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,780
training class

910
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,460
and that class is intended to help

911
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,859
people who are planning to run

912
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:59,940
assessments understand how to do that

913
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,060
the Train the trainer class is a two-day

914
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,640
session which is intended to help people

915
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,980
who intend to present the one day

916
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,619
training learn how to do that

917
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,579
so under the grant that Saba mentioned

918
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,560
briefly I developed and presented the

919
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,440
Train the trainer class and we made some

920
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,359
improvements based on feedback we

921
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,920
received and that's what's published

922
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,880
there

923
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,820
but it is like the model itself it's a

924
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,560
growth stage

925
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,839
so if you're interested in starting to

926
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,240
do assessments the best thing to do

927
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,220
would be to attend one of the classes

928
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,140
they're very often in conjunction with

929
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,480
global OS conferences

930
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,980
when you get to the point where you

931
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,560
would like to start training your own

932
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,800
assessors then you might

933
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,540
take part in to train the trainer class

934
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,880
in order for you then to be at the front

935
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,339
of the room presenting the training

936
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:54,660
okay

937
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,060
thank you for that now I'll go ahead and

938
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,420
continue with sharing my screen briefly

939
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,240
now Sam wise

940
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,980
as I mentioned when we introduced it

941
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,540
briefly earlier

942
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,660
Sam wise is not

943
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,020
an extension beyond the Excel workbook

944
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,240
in fact it has only a subset of its

945
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,880
capabilities but this is meant to be a

946
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,460
starting point to get to having an

947
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,240
application based assessment system

948
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,359
on the home page for the Samwise app you

949
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,579
can see what you can do right now

950
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,280
are enter responses for a single

951
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,960
assessment

952
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,359
visualize your maturity results so we've

953
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,099
got some dynamic graphs that will let

954
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,320
you see your maturity results

955
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,020
for that single assessment

956
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,680
and then in the visualization page we

957
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,200
have the ability to import one previous

958
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,079
assessment and do a side by side in the

959
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,339
graphs

960
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,339
so that is is of course less than you

961
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,859
can do with the Excel workbook but that

962
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,020
was the minimum product we were able to

963
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,520
put together

964
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,060
before Datacom told us we needed to go

965
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,500
do paying work instead

966
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,900
the intent here is to support the Sam

967
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,780
project which is mentioned

968
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,520
if you look at our about tab it

969
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,079
basically says what what are we looking

970
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,760
at and this is one of the things I want

971
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,619
to point out what we would really like

972
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,880
to do

973
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,020
is enhance the capabilities of the

974
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,740
application to rival and even Excel what

975
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,220
you can do in the roadmap workbook

976
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,500
to the ability to the point of being

977
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,540
able to have multiple phase road maps

978
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,579
and showing the progressive graphs the

979
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:50,160
same as you see in the Excel workbook to

980
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,599
be able to

981
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,579
obviously to do that

982
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,220
do it as a look back you can do it as

983
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,260
planning saying I just did an assessment

984
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,619
I want to plan my future Milestones you

985
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,619
can also say I did an assessment today I

986
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,359
would like to compare that with the

987
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,339
assessments from three six and nine

988
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,420
months ago

989
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,280
so instead of being able to prepare with

990
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,020
one we'd love to be able to let you do

991
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,400
multiple

992
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,560
and then this is where I think we'll

993
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,920
really see the value as the two tracks

994
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,119
come together

995
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,380
is when we have the Sam Benchmark data

996
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,200
model done and there's a published API

997
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,460
to allow you to access

998
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,700
Benchmark aggregate data as well as

999
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,460
submit Benchmark data sets to be able to

1000
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,920
do that from within the application

1001
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,079
so that once you've done an assessment

1002
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,760
you can say I would like to compare

1003
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,180
myself with the global Benchmark for

1004
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,160
financial services companies

1005
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,220
pull that data set Through The Benchmark

1006
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,400
projects API and view that within the

1007
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,780
application

1008
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,480
similarly what we would really like to

1009
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,339
get to is where you can complete an

1010
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:03,960
assessment look through the

1011
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,240
visualization say yes that is where we

1012
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
are today I would like to contribute

1013
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,500
that to the benchmark

1014
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,079
and simply to

1015
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,760
click a button which will

1016
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,680
de-identify your assessment

1017
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,319
containing only your metadata about your

1018
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,900
industry size number of applications and

1019
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,380
so on along with your responses and

1020
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,359
submit that to the review queue for The

1021
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,680
Benchmark project

1022
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,839
so our goal is to get to the point where

1023
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,660
all of that would be within the tool

1024
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,240
of course we are not there today

1025
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,119
what we have right now is the ability to

1026
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,160
go through the Sam interview

1027
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,859
questionnaire in a single page

1028
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,720
application

1029
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,760
now the application is written in

1030
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,460
JavaScript it's based on survey.js so

1031
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,319
you'll notice it looks an awful lot like

1032
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,040
say a SurveyMonkey survey

1033
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,740
they have similar roots

1034
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,319
so all of that information you see and

1035
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,480
can enter in the interview tab of the

1036
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,960
Excel workbook is presented here

1037
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,940
the question

1038
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,660
and since um Sable was talking about

1039
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,520
education and guidance we can look at

1040
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,579
that one so for the level one is the

1041
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,260
level one question do you require

1042
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,440
employees to have sdlc training

1043
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,180
if you'd like to review the qualifying

1044
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,880
criteria you can expand that you can see

1045
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,619
because it does take up a good bit of

1046
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,839
room we make it so that that can be

1047
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,220
collapsed

1048
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,119
and then you can select one of the four

1049
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:41,520
values and you can also type comments

1050
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,000
which are in column

1051
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,960
I want to say I of the interview

1052
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,119
spreadsheet tab so we've given you the

1053
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,839
ability to complete an interview here in

1054
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,420
this app

1055
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,640
right now as a very intentional

1056
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,579
step we've decided that everything is

1057
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,560
run locally so this you can see is

1058
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,319
actually running locally I just started

1059
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,660
it up as it's an npm app I just started

1060
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,780
it

1061
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,380
we have not yet but we intend to host

1062
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,160
the ability to go to a URL on the oau

1063
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,220
Sam website and start the app

1064
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,079
but all of that will really do is

1065
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,119
download the JavaScript so you can run

1066
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,200
it locally

1067
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,300
and the only option that you have for

1068
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,700
saving right now

1069
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,720
is to save your responses to your local

1070
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,780
file system in a Json file

1071
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,660
so your responses do not go anywhere

1072
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,660
other than your local system

1073
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,579
in the future

1074
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,880
as I talked about the bigger vision for

1075
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,380
this application

1076
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,780
we would like to follow the model that

1077
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,700
actually threat Dragon does one of the

1078
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,200
other OAS projects so you can go to an

1079
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,660
Enterprise

1080
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,359
site somewhere on your Intranet

1081
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,819
start the application complete your

1082
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,160
responses and when you save your

1083
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,760
responses they will go into your

1084
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,500
organization's repository of assessments

1085
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,660
once they're in the Repository

1086
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,300
another objective will be to create

1087
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,880
a sister application that will let you

1088
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,240
have a benchmark and scorecards to look

1089
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,839
at which of your projects have done

1090
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,420
assessments what was their Baseline

1091
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,920
score how are they progressing against

1092
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,220
their their roadmap targets and all of

1093
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,480
that can be looked at as a

1094
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,040
dashboard for the organization so that's

1095
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,740
really where we'd like to see this go

1096
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,660
and this initial application gets us

1097
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,119
that core engine

1098
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,880
as I go through the questions I

1099
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,220
make some choices and I'm not going to

1100
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,119
go through all 90 of them but let's say

1101
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,960
just for this practice

1102
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,839
and for a couple of the others I'll go

1103
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,000
ahead and

1104
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,040
make some arbitrary selections

1105
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,480
but it would help if I did not lose

1106
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,040
track of where I was

1107
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,119
so I've done strategy metrics

1108
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,460
portions and sorry there we go

1109
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,280
I knew I still didn't want to do

1110
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,950
live demos

1111
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,029
[Music]

1112
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,500
so rather than go through the entire

1113
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,880
assessment I've just filled out the

1114
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,680
answers for

1115
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,040
a single business function if I then go

1116
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,480
to results

1117
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,440
I will see a summary of the responses I

1118
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,800
have submitted so of the 18 responses I

1119
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,380
gave I had two no's

1120
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,319
six partials

1121
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,140
five at least halves and five yes for

1122
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,220
alls and then that worked out to be a

1123
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,160
maturity for the entire business

1124
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,579
function of 1.5 out of three and then I

1125
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:24,240
can see for my individual practices that

1126
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,280
I got to 1.75 on two of them and 1.0 out

1127
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,680
of three on the third we have the radar

1128
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,740
chart and spider graph so that you can

1129
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,819
see

1130
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,980
right away as you start to pull these

1131
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,020
pull together your assessment responses

1132
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,480
you can come here and dynamically check

1133
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,540
and see oh how does that look and as you

1134
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,400
you can go back and forth between the

1135
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,079
assessment and visualization

1136
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,300
when you're done

1137
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,040
you can say yep I want to save my

1138
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,119
responses

1139
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,099
and then the second option I have is

1140
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,480
that I can say I want to select another

1141
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,819
one Json file against which I would like

1142
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,819
to compare this

1143
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,220
since this visualization is very useful

1144
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,720
and these images might be something

1145
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,480
you'd want to pull into a report we've

1146
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,579
added the export graphs function so it

1147
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,819
will generate a PDF with the graphs as

1148
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:20,940
you see them just sequentially in the

1149
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,099
document that allows you to capture

1150
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:25,560
those and then you can grab the images

1151
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,140
out and use them in other documents as

1152
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,440
you wish

1153
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,200
that is where we are and I see I pretty

1154
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,020
much hit time we aren't 10 till the hour

1155
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,560
yes all right thank you John indeed and

1156
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,800
I'll also uh continue sharing my screen

1157
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,440
again so it's it's time for Q a just

1158
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,020
just before that I just also love to

1159
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,380
point out where you can you find uh or

1160
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,980
wasp Sun obviously on our GitHub and

1161
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,680
there it's one of the repositories

1162
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,420
somewise right here so if you want to

1163
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,220
start it out right here then that's

1164
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,319
where you find the latest and greatest

1165
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,099
version of some rides so with that

1166
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:11,579
will open the floor for a q a

1167
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,720
all right thanks for the session

1168
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,339
uh we have a couple of questions in the

1169
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,020
Q a

1170
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,880
um a question the class yesterday was

1171
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,520
canceled when will the next training

1172
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,060
session be available

1173
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,880
for the the trained trainer that is most

1174
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,480
most probably it will take place as part

1175
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,000
of the next Global upsec in San

1176
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,020
Francisco

1177
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,339
uh now that will be an in-person uh I

1178
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,200
would say conference so I'm assuming

1179
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,200
also the training will be in person at

1180
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,660
that point in time

1181
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,099
with that said

1182
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,720
um from time to time we also get

1183
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,640
questions from other organizations to do

1184
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,800
a training for instance I did one a

1185
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,280
couple of months ago in Finland uh where

1186
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,920
we were invited by the isaka and Os

1187
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,000
chapters there locally so if you have a

1188
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,700
group of 10 people or more that you

1189
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,619
think would benefit from having a

1190
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,859
training either remote or on-site reach

1191
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,140
out to us and we'll uh we'll make it

1192
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,259
happen

1193
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:22,380
all right I apologize saber was the the

1194
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,300
class that was scheduled was that the

1195
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,599
one day or the Train the trainer

1196
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:28,980
will typically be scheduled one day

1197
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,280
trainings uh and so it was uh scheduled

1198
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,980
for for a global upstick Dublin here but

1199
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,839
unfortunately there were not enough uh

1200
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,599
registrations uh for the training to uh

1201
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,680
to continue

1202
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,920
so if you're looking for a a subtropical

1203
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,660
winter vacation

1204
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,300
the next offering will actually be in

1205
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,460
three weeks in Auckland New Zealand at

1206
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,619
the OAS New Zealand Day Conference

1207
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:55,020
exactly the conference will be live

1208
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,460
streamed and you're welcome to register

1209
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,220
for that I should have plugged it more

1210
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,140
um but the training is actually face to

1211
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,379
face

1212
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,260
yeah all right cool thanks for the

1213
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,220
answers

1214
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,140
another question

1215
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,900
um if we are building an appsec program

1216
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,780
into a new team is Sam a good place to

1217
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,960
start

1218
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,900
but uh you made with a new team it's

1219
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,420
some a good place to start uh yes of

1220
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,119
course it's it's a good way to start uh

1221
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,300
but make sure that some is not I would

1222
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,000
say the goal it's your tool and your

1223
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,119
framework to improve your activities

1224
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,400
um so and there's definitely a couple of

1225
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,920
like really basic foundational

1226
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,980
activities in some that will uh that

1227
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,240
will kick-start your your roadmap one

1228
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,800
example of them being the educational

1229
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,720
guidance but there's others in there as

1230
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,640
well the threat modeling part the

1231
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,440
testing part

1232
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,300
um making sure that you have a good

1233
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,540
build and deployment

1234
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,520
system in place that you have the

1235
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,660
plugins for adding tools to that to the

1236
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,720
oci CD Pipelines so there's definitely a

1237
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,180
couple of uh I would say foundational

1238
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,700
activities in there that that for a new

1239
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,960
team would be recommended

1240
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,460
I guess a slightly different take on the

1241
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,859
answer I'll go ahead and assume that

1242
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,260
you're talking about an organization

1243
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,000
that is doing things has built products

1244
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,880
is selling software but hasn't stood up

1245
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,319
a team before

1246
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:34,079
in that situation this is actually a

1247
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,480
place where I've used Sam it's a great

1248
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,240
way to take stock of the good things

1249
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,819
that are going on

1250
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,760
and to make a conscious decision to

1251
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,099
adopt some of them as the organization's

1252
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,660
standard

1253
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,240
so if you think we would really like for

1254
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,099
there to be a consistent threat modeling

1255
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,559
practice across the organization

1256
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,240
and in the process of doing a Sam

1257
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,400
assessment you learn that one team has

1258
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,380
been doing threat modeling and they've

1259
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,880
got some really great threat models

1260
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,559
they've got good scripts they have a

1261
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,140
nice Cadence for doing it

1262
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,380
adopt it

1263
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,000
and then when you get to that level two

1264
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,040
and say do we have a consistent process

1265
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,640
yes we do we took that one and applied

1266
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,720
it to the whole organization

1267
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,720
indeed currently so John answered it for

1268
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,040
a question where you have like already

1269
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,200
an organization and other practices I

1270
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,900
assumed like a green field like totally

1271
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,599
new startup so but you can use some in

1272
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,319
both situations

1273
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,500
all right cool thanks for that

1274
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,480
um a question I have

1275
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,640
um what are some of the common pitfalls

1276
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,980
you see when when organization adopts

1277
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,099
them

1278
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,160
foreign

1279
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,619
I would say to be uh probably too

1280
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:59,400
ambitious uh in in uh in applying the

1281
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,099
whole framework to to everything at the

1282
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,900
same time

1283
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,619
um

1284
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,260
I would say one of the best practices to

1285
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,740
start small with one or two teams uh

1286
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,720
that typically maybe represent the rest

1287
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,020
of the organization and go for what we

1288
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,540
call like the very basic adoption of

1289
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,119
some I like what are you doing how what

1290
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,700
kind of like easy steps can we add to to

1291
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,400
your practice and start tracking that

1292
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,920
with some and demonstrating how some can

1293
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,020
be helpful for your organization and

1294
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,660
from there build out your uh your your

1295
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,640
practice towards the different other

1296
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,660
teams so but starting off like with the

1297
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,400
full implementation for everything at

1298
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,440
the same time that's it's going to be

1299
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,920
hurtful

1300
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:47,720
um

1301
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,940
one other one that I see quite a bit

1302
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:55,680
is too much of a focus on the raw score

1303
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,200
and and really it's a misunderstanding

1304
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,240
of the purpose of the tool

1305
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,119
but it's important

1306
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,940
and and can be a stumbling block right

1307
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,200
out of the gate

1308
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,059
if

1309
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:11,880
you aren't able to communicate to

1310
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,180
everyone that there are no repercussions

1311
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,880
for having a current score that's not

1312
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,680
great that we are not using this as a

1313
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,720
way to decide which teams are better

1314
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,460
than others and that you'll somehow be

1315
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,579
punished later it has to be very clearly

1316
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:32,960
communicated that we want to understand

1317
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,940
where our gaps are

1318
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,420
so that we can work toward improving

1319
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,000
and to make it very clear that what the

1320
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,800
most important thing the most valuable

1321
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,160
output from our engagement with a team

1322
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,319
is we want honest input

1323
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,040
and so I very often will get involved in

1324
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,980
organization I'll say well can't we go

1325
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,380
ahead and count this sort of thing we're

1326
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,319
doing so we can get a better score it's

1327
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,240
the score doesn't matter

1328
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,660
and overcoming that and then as as sable

1329
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,920
alluded to

1330
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,260
the other flip side of thinking that we

1331
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,559
have got to get to 3.0 anything less is

1332
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,500
a failure that is also not true

1333
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,559
so it's these

1334
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,020
I see those as big pitfalls of not

1335
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,940
really understanding

1336
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,020
the right way to think about a Sam

1337
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,700
maturity score and targets

1338
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,540
and that's very insightful feedback I

1339
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,520
would say as I think a lot of

1340
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,619
organizations are aiming for a for the

1341
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,839
highest score immediately I want I want

1342
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,760
to be a tree

1343
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,760
um let's start low and be honest with

1344
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,359
yourself as a as a team or a squad

1345
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:57,119
now if you want to if you want to have

1346
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,819
as an internal metric

1347
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:02,520
how close you are coming to your target

1348
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,619
score

1349
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:08,700
as a measure of progress that's useful

1350
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,220
but your target score is probably not

1351
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,559
going to be a three

1352
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,160
typically I've seen a Target aggregate

1353
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,420
being around a 2.2

1354
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,760
all right cool thanks uh John

1355
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,700
um maybe one final question

1356
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,420
um

1357
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,579
I see there are a lot of possibilities

1358
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:36,180
to to contribute to the same like for

1359
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,599
example by uh via crowding via

1360
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,510
um data sets via

1361
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,660
[Music]

1362
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,660
um yeah all other things

1363
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,680
um

1364
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,220
any additions to that like for example

1365
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,859
can contributors help on the on the same

1366
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:54,359
wise application

1367
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:58,280
oh yes please before yes

1368
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,500
you are more you're more than welcome to

1369
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,500
indeed to help us help us out some has

1370
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,480
become quite a quite a big project a lot

1371
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,760
of things uh in motion

1372
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,619
um I think especially now we're working

1373
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:13,020
with on The Benchmark so so Brian can

1374
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,420
definitely use some help there

1375
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,460
um with the MVP implementation there's

1376
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,140
there's lots of stuff aren't even going

1377
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,780
so the best page to actually go through

1378
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:25,339
is the awesome uh the Lord Community

1379
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:27,359
contributing page

1380
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,520
we we do get this question a lot so

1381
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,559
here's different pointers what uh to

1382
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:33,960
what you can do and how you can reach

1383
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,940
out to us

1384
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,640
and then I would say the best way to

1385
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,920
also uh contribute this to a reach out

1386
