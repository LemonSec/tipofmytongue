hi everybody this unfortunately already

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,360
our closing keynote for the first day of

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,280
our global Earth virtual upsec 22. this

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,400
one is shiran Saban technical expert is

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,820
a focus on cloud security

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,760
is as co-founder and CEO of solofo the

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,199
first application we had Cloud Security

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,180
Solutions but I don't want to go wrong

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,560
because he said she will introduce

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,679
herself she's professional certain cyber

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,360
security has been military in an

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
intelligent unit stronger believes in

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,260
empowering women that's what you see on

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,200
her t-shirt as he showed to me

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,980
um

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,540
she's very represented in the community

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,760
and Technology world she is volunteering

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,480
election monitoring she's a

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,379

introduction and hi everyone thank you

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,600
for having me today

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,460
um good evening to all of you in Europe

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,520
uh for me this is good morning from San

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
Francisco I am at the RSA conference

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,439
right now I hope I'm sure you had a very

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,939
good day today at apsec EU and hopefully

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,600
um you will find some some interesting

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,820
topics today and in the rest of the

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,880
conference as well

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,700
um so let's get started

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,020
so as Martin mentioned I am Shira on my

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,600
day-to-day life I'm CEO and co-founder

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,119
of solvo solver is a platform that helps

39
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,579
developers devops and security teams to

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,840
keep a least privileged Cloud

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
application automatically

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,700
uh and if you want to learn more about

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,439
it we can talk about it later it is not

44
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,200
the topic of our conversation today but

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
other than Cloud security I'm also the

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,560
co-chair of OSP Israel but I have to say

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,080
that my greatest achievement in life has

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
nothing to do with cyber security a few

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,940
years back I was working for a company

50
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,140
that got acquired by a large corporate

51
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,020
and thanks to to this acquisition what

52
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,060
happened was that the corporate made a

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,060
change in their policy and they became a

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,540
dog friendly company thanks to my dog so

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,400
I definitely feel like this is my

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
greatest achievement in life yet that

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,900
made the difference for thousands of

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
employees worldwide

59
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,300
uh but now you know everything important

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,980
to know about myself so we can get

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,680
started and talk more about business and

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,780
about Cloud security

63
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,280
uh always top 10 uh I think most of you

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,700
are familiar with this project uh but if

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,280
not I will just say that this is a

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
community project uh that started many

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,459
years ago actually almost 20 years ago

68
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,040
uh where the community and the Security

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,239
Experts point out at the most common or

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,239
the most popular risks and security

71
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,300
issues that we're seeing in in

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,540
applications in web applications

73
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,580
um because we want to raise the

74
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,400
awareness and help developers and

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,580
everyone else in the process to adapt a

76
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,620
smarter and more secure way to deliver

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,440
those applications so that for it's for

78
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,519
us for the end user to feel more secured

79
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,900
about it

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,200
um now in 20 years the world has changed

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,040
20 years since OAS was established and

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
the applications that we create

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,420
changed the technologies that we're

84
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,319
using changed so obviously in the top 10

85
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,659
risks that appear in those

86
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,700
um in the document that is being

87
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,379
published every few years

88
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,280
also update and change over time for me

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,340
as a cloud entrepreneur I was curious to

90
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,220
take a closer look at the impact that

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,319
the cloud made to the applications

92
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,180
security landscape

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,579
I want to remind you that when the cloud

94
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,478
burst into our lives and it was kind of

95
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,699
a Data Center Alternative it wasn't

96
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,460
supposed to uh be what it actually be or

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,080
I don't know if it wasn't supposed to be

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
but we didn't dream the cloud would

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,840
become what it is today

100
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,520
and I will show you my thesis around it

101
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,380
but I think that there is a very thin

102
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,900
line today between application security

103
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,580
and infrastructure security they

104
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,500
actually go very well together

105
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,860
so in this talk we're going to go back

106
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,160
in time 15 years back actually to look

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,699
at always top 10 and how it changed from

108
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,520
a 2007 I will be starting from the top

109
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,460
10 of 2007 until today the last hours

110
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,180
Pro 10 was released in 2001. so this is

111
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,340
a 15-year perspective

112
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,800
later I will share with you my

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,259
predictions

114
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:12,360
or my assumptions they are all mine not

115
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,199
and always official opinion about uh the

116
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,380
future of our top 10.

117
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,979
so one other important thing I have to

118
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,039
say before we move forward I'm going to

119
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,039
share here the top 10 from 2007 until

120
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,000
today I did some digging into the uh um

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,460
documentation that is available to

122
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,800
everyone on the online

123
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,020
and occasionally I found some

124
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,360
inconsistencies in the order of

125
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
appearance of the risks

126
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
so during this talk I will not be a

127
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,400
referring to the ranking of of the um

128
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,699
the risks so don't look at the order of

129
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,560
appearance if something appears on the

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,180
top that doesn't mean it was number one

131
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,900
that year uh let's just focus on the

132
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,280
risks themselves that appeared in um in

133
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,220
every year that we will be talking about

134
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,440
we're not going to talk about each risk

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,900
specifically I just want to look at the

136
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,340
overall trend in 2007 we had some new

137
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,120
and newcomers some new risks that showed

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,460
up this year

139
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,860
I will be highlighting in green the new

140
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,780
risks that came in this year so csrf

141
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,400
insecure communication and malicious

142
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,240
file extension were new at new 2007.

143
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,360
it's interesting to see how those things

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,919
are still relevant

145
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,860
um today now in in general for the sake

146
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,500
of our conversation today I will be

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,380
grouping the risks in into two

148
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,520
categories uh I did this uh dividing it

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,560
is not an always a terminology and I

150
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,039
look at two groups today one is the user

151
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,580
and application interaction category and

152
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,460
the other is backend and infrastructure

153
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,020
related

154
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,199
um risks the user application group is

155
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,180
looking at the interactions between the

156
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,599
user or and the malicious user and the

157
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,120
application so that could mean code

158
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,819
injection that could mean URL

159
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,000
manipulation and this kind of things so

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,780
in 2007 we saw um

161
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,199
four risks that belong to the group of

162
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,620
uh of the user application interaction I

163
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,900
will I will be highlighting that in

164
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,099
yellow

165
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,759
throughout the entire talk so green for

166
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,759
new risk yellow for the user and

167
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,419
application uh risk so

168
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,419
um in the back end and in the backend

169
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,979
group of vulnerabilities of the risks we

170
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,300
have the encryption we have the

171
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,479
authentication and we have the network

172
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,520
and we will see how this evolved over

173
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,099
time but this is 2007 and this is where

174
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,199
we are starting

175
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,780
now the next thing I want to do after we

176
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,759
talk about the vulnerabilities is what

177
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,580
happened in the cloud world

178
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,879
from the day of the uh

179
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,699
this document they all document was

180
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,860
released until the next one was released

181
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,419
what happened in the cloud world so

182
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,940
really important stuff to talk about uh

183
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,799
between 2006 to 2010 is first of all

184
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,779
first of all you know an important

185
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,820
reminder always puts here before the

186
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,560
cloud uh also started early 2000 and AWS

187
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,519
was born in 2006.

188
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
um a year later our good friend S3

189
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,860
bucket came to the world still very

190
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,440
popular to this day and it's pretty

191
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,620
amazing to to think about how popular it

192
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,560
is and how we can't create any

193
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,500
application without using it in 2008

194
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,440
Google released the Google app engine

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,220
that later became what we are familiar

196
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,640
with as gcp so this is when these guys

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,519
came to the world

198
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,459
moving forward in our journey in time to

199
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,300
2010 two new risks made a first

200
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,360
appearance that year the security

201
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,720
misconfiguration and I unvalidated

202
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,420
redirected and forwards uh by the way

203
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,680
according to the 2010 documentation

204
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,620
misconfiguration was also include a we

205
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,019
refer to misconfiguration as also

206
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,320
unpatched packages exposed admin pages

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,740
and server configuration so today when

208
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,660
we talk about misconfiguration very

209
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,300
often we relate to things like leaky S3

210
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,080
buckets we size three buckets only 2007

211
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,360
so when in the OS documentation we

212
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,640
talked about misconfiguration we still

213
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,459
related to more uh traditional and

214
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,860
classic misconfigurations and not to the

215
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,019
cloud misconfigurations as we know them

216
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,240
today

217
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
um so another fun fact is that security

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
misconfiguration was a part of os top 10

219
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,860
of 2004. it had a little the name was

220
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,420
slightly different in Secure

221
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,540
configuration management it was dropped

222
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,260
out in 2007 because it wasn't considered

223
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,399
to be a software issue however from the

224
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,279
organizational risk

225
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,399
perspective it cleared it was clearly a

226
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,160
part of the top ten and this is why the

227
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,500
team that built that document decided to

228
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,000
put it back

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
so let's get back to my classification

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,060
of risks and in the um user app

231
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,880
domain uh and the risks that we have now

232
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,040
we have four of those uh the previous

233
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,480
year we had four now we have five uh in

234
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,540
my world again in my definition these

235
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,420
risks have to do a with the interaction

236
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,480
between a user and things that between

237
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,060
the user and the application a a

238
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,399
malicious user as well

239
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,040
so they when we're talking about things

240
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,820
like uh getting access to unused pages

241
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,420
and patched flaws unprotected files and

242
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,220
directories

243
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,760
um if they're unauthorized to do so and

244
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,720
in the backend group we are still mostly

245
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,560
talking about encryption and networks so

246
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,339
no massive changes over there yet but

247
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,079
let's move forward

248
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,459
what happened during this time and in

249
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,040
the world of cloud

250
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,660
in 2009 the cloud infrastructure is

251
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,779
becoming more dominant it is the go-to

252
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,320
for startups and for Enterprises that

253
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,899
are creating new applications some of

254
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,240
the Enterprises are still in their

255
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,720
on-prem and Legacy Technologies but just

256
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,320
wrap your head around it in 2009 the

257
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,480
cloud Market size was 58 billion dollars

258
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,620
recently in 2001 it was over 300 billion

259
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,540
dollars

260
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,480
Microsoft for a little late in 2010 they

261
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,500
introduced us to a Microsoft Azure as

262
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,440
you guys and girls probably know Azure

263
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,920
today is the second most popular a cloud

264
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,139
vendor so they uh they beat a Google in

265
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,940
the race

266
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
we're getting closer

267
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,120
to to to nowadays uh we're now talking

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,620
about the OS top 10 of

269
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,279
2013. uh this year we only had one new

270
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,480
uh entry maybe not exactly a new entry a

271
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,880
more of a merge between insecure

272
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,279
cryptographic storage and insufficient

273
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,560
transport layer they both became

274
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,760
together sensitive data exposure

275
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,260
um so not a lot of news

276
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,260
in oasp this year but on the other hand

277
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,200
we had some very interesting things in

278
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,540
that period of time in the world of

279
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,459
cloud

280
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:46,579
um in 2013 a company named dot Cloud

281
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,940
released Docker as an open source a tool

282
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,000
aimed at simplifying the usage of Linux

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,339
containers and making them accessible

284
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,880
for everyone if you're not familiar with

285
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,940
DOT Cloud this is because today we just

286
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,959
know it as docker

287
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,500
so think about it this is a 2013 that's

288
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,380
almost 10 years ago it feels like only

289
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,200
today we are really getting the hang of

290
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
it and how to use the uh this technology

291
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,920
well and securely

292
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,560
2014 Google launches kubernetes as an

293
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,660
open source container orchestration

294
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,120
system to automate application

295
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,240
deployment and scaling and management so

296
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,220
again these are things that are now very

297
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,120
very very popular but back then that was

298
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,440
just the early beginning uh 2013 we were

299
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,380
also introduced to AWS Lambda the

300
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,420
serverless

301
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,120
so no doubt that this period of a

302
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
2013-14 was very very interesting in the

303
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,860
world of cloud and I think that at this

304
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,240
point we're also seeing a Tipping Point

305
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,680
in the top 10 risks at oasp we will

306
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,880
start you using thing less a user

307
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,660
application kind of risks it's not that

308
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,959
they don't exist but we're seeing more

309
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,560
risks in the world of backend and in the

310
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,180
world of infrastructure and how

311
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,019
infrastructure is becoming more relevant

312
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:32,820
to our world of risk management and the

313
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,940
popularity of those risks

314
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,660
um

315
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,079
where in 2017 we are almost

316
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,959
we are almost now

317
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,899
and so we're almost over with our

318
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,980
journeying time uh always top 10 brought

319
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,899
to us five new risks uh one of them was

320
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,199
emerged broken Access Control uh was

321
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,860
insecure direct object reference and

322
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,320
missing functional uh function level

323
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,800
access control so these two became one

324
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,899
risk

325
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,699
insufficient logging and monitoring in

326
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,820
my opinion is a risk that definitely has

327
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,639
a lot to do with Cloud the place where

328
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,820
we became dependent on third parties to

329
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,620
provide us with services that we we must

330
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,380
keep track on and make sure we are on

331
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,220
top of every event in every incident and

332
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,800
we need to make sure which data went

333
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,899
where and how come this event happened

334
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,120
this way and not another uh made us

335
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,000
desperately need logs coming from other

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,980
products or other services that we're

337
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,839
using

338
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,300
um logging was also important in on-prem

339
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,120
days don't get me wrong but this time we

340
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,040
need them even more because so many

341
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,620
things happen that we might not even be

342
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,440
aware of so I think that logging became

343
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,380
an issue because of the popularity of

344
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,900
Open Source Code multiple Security

345
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,799
operation products uh just the the

346
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,020
multiple products all over the place not

347
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,319
to mention uh using multi-cloud and even

348
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,859
hybrid cloud and of course uh

349
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,599
more open source and different

350
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,059
Frameworks that we're using

351
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,020
um

352
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,939
according to my classification another

353
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,700
thing that we see

354
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,640
this year we only had two user

355
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,860
application

356
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,919
risks the other ones the the back and

357
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,039
the kind of risks are exploitable or

358
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
Martin corrected me that we don't look

359
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
at them as vulnerabilities but at risks

360
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
but they are exploitable

361
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
of course but

362
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,440
from other levels of the application

363
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,020
they are not really in the user

364
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,900
interface at least in my classification

365
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,740
the way I see it so we're moving away

366
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,559
from the user application interface

367
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,360
going deeper into the application the

368
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,120
back end of the application the third

369
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,100
parties and the different services that

370
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,660
we are using in order to make this

371
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,080
application functional for us

372
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,320
um so this is where I'm taking this now

373
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,340
so the back end is related to the

374
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,320
vulnerabilities that now have to do with

375
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,400
data with access to data and different

376
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,580
resources and with authentication and as

377
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,700
we mentioned before the logging so this

378
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,860
is getting interesting we're living at

379
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,799
the area of the users and getting closer

380
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,419
to the back end of the application

381
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,360
closer to the technology

382
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
um

383
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,260
at this point I when I was looking into

384
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,660
the history of the modern history of the

385
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,179
cloud it was getting harder for me to

386
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,640
identify

387
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
groundbreaking events

388
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,980
for for the cloud domain I think it's

389
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,320
because it became such a mainstream and

390
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,320
such a such a popular technology and

391
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,539
natural technology to use in our life

392
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,120
that

393
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,760
maybe we take things as granted but when

394
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,940
I wanted to to look badly for you know

395
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,039
more groundbreaking events it was

396
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,700
getting harder

397
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,220
now we made it to the always top 10 of

398
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,539
2021 that's the light latest release of

399
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,919
August top 10. this year we had three

400
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,039
new entries or three new risks one of

401
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,940
them was a renaming and expanding of of

402
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,960
the existing definition

403
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,580
it's interesting to see that in 2007

404
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,919
client signed request forgery was a new

405
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,280
entry and in 2001 the server side

406
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,179
request forgery was a new entry so you

407
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,160
see where I'm taking this right we're

408
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,039
moving away from the user closer to the

409
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,900
back end

410
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,520
um again if we take a look at my

411
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,220
classification of the risks we will see

412
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,280
that we grew further apart from the user

413
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,480
basically all we have left in the

414
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,720
um user application a group is the

415
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,780
injection the other risks we have to do

416
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,059
with uh have to do with the code of the

417
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,120
application the component uh the

418
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,880
components the application is using and

419
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,179
basically this is a area I like to call

420
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,299
it Plumbing uh Plumbing means that we

421
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,400
connect different components together

422
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,320
that we didn't build

423
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,539
uh making sure that all the different

424
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,480
parts work well together they enable

425
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,720
small a smooth flow of data and the

426
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
functionality of the application even

427
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,880
though we didn't build each part

428
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,280
specifically by ourselves and this time

429
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
it includes Access Control

430
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,140
authentication and encryption and this

431
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,080
is why the last version of the WASP top

432
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,039
10 we only have a one user application

433
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,400
related risk again this is my my take on

434
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
it and the take on on how the cloud made

435
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,440
us move apart from the user interaction

436
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,900
and closer to the infrastructure and

437
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,760
backend

438
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
um so this is again in my opinion the

439
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,220
biggest change that the cloud

440
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,960
infrastructure brought to application

441
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,000
security the fact that the

442
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,880
infrastructure is an integral part of

443
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,919
the application and we can't do

444
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,740
application security without taking a

445
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,200
very close look at the infrastructure

446
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,840
the cloud infrastructure and to make

447
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,659
sure we use it correctly it is well

448
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:55,980
configured

449
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,720
it doesn't expose our data and uh not

450
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,059
our data and not other people's data not

451
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,820
data of the application and only the

452
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,940
necessary entities an entity can be a

453
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,620
user or it can be another Cloud

454
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,200
component or an external cloud account

455
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,679
only the necessary entities get the

456
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,280
necessary access that they need in your

457
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,559
Cloud application on average you have

458
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,840
dozens of third parties and other SAS

459
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,760
products that are connected to your

460
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,080
application and you want to make sure

461
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,900
that they only have access to the

462
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,360
specific data and resources that they

463
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,179
need it's really easy right I know you

464
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,280
can do it

465
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,419
so

466
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,140
we went over a the office top 10 from

467
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,059
2007 until uh 2021 but what does it mean

468
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,280
for us

469
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,059
um to sum up the going back in time this

470
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,240
time this part of our journey

471
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,260
there are a few things I want to share

472
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,020
with you

473
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,080
uh we saw that from focusing on the code

474
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,299
of the application and the user

475
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,419
application interface interface the OS

476
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,240
top 10 is showing more risks that have

477
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,659
to do with behind the scenes so we no

478
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,940
longer uh

479
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,100
it's not that we no longer manipulate

480
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,460
URLs to get access to the to the hidden

481
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,179
data but we can find it in a

482
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,880
misconfigured S3 bucket so today we just

483
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,200
have more ways uh to do some nasty stuff

484
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,120
we no longer need to exploit broken

485
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,000
authentication we can see that you are

486
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,100
saying an admin role to an

487
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,440
internet-facing ec2 machine so we can

488
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,120
take over that

489
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,559
these kind of risks existed in the past

490
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,980
but they certainly exist today but they

491
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,679
just made some adaptations into

492
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,159
um into the cloud world

493
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,220
in the past there used to be a part of

494
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,480
the I.T team to to make sure that the

495
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,980
servers are not exposed to the Internet

496
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,080
so the developers wrote the code handed

497
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,799
it over security was a silo and we

498
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,240
didn't do we didn't have to do anything

499
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,360
about it but today it's a part of the

500
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,299
cicd process where we actually have

501
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,960
developers and devops and security team

502
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,320
involved in the process so it's a flow

503
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,900
no more silos and everyone has to work

504
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,780
together so all of us need to make sure

505
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,400
that it's a joint effort

506
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,640
to secure our application and our data

507
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,059
no longer separated teams but now every

508
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,460
everyone is actually working together on

509
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,620
this

510
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,919
um in the 2017 report the writers

511
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,760
created a very nice infographic of the

512
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,500
previous

513
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,559
risks in previous reports so I took the

514
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,220
liberty to create an updated version of

515
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,260
this

516
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,480
chart please feel free to take a

517
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,080
screenshot if you want to get a kind of

518
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,059
a

519
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,960
overview of how the OS top 10 changed in

520
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,020
the last 15 years I will also ask Martin

521
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,440
later if we can publish this as some

522
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
kind of a white paper or put it in the

523
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,740
always

524
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,640
um website for everyone to use

525
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,980
so feel free to dig into this and see

526
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,279
for yourself how different risks went

527
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,260
out of the OS top 10 that doesn't mean

528
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,120
these risks don't exist anymore but we

529
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,460
you have to prioritize right so

530
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,620
theoretically we could have had over top

531
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,679
100 but when we had to choose the top 10

532
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,520
these are the ones that made the cut and

533
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,679
it's really interesting to see how they

534
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,100
changed and adapt over time based on the

535
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,080
new technologies that we see getting

536
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,980
into our lives

537
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,980
um

538
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,880
so I promised you uh I will talk about

539
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,900
my predictions which again are my own I

540
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,700
don't think I have a lot of news here I

541
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,380
didn't come up with risks that you're

542
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,799
unfamiliar with but I try to maybe look

543
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,880
at

544
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,820
what I'm seeing the events and the

545
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,440
incident and the breaches that I'm

546
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,640
seeing today and kind of guess

547
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,580
where is it going to hit us and what in

548
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,980
my opinion makes sense to see in the

549
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,020
future

550
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,820
of us top 10.

551
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,400
um so in in a way we finished going back

552
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,980
in time and now we're going forward in

553
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,659
time

554
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,880
um and the bottom line in my in my

555
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,539
opinion is that there isn't a lot of

556
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,400
news

557
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,799
uh we previously didn't see

558
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,240
um any specific API risk in the OS top

559
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,779
10 in the previous reports

560
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:11,159
even though please remember that there

561
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,039
is a dedicated project at OAS for API

562
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,299
security

563
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,900
uh I think that API risks and

564
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,360
vulnerabilities are going to grow bigger

565
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,419
and bigger on us uh and other than that

566
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,640
I think we keep on seeing the same

567
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,279
things generally speaking over and over

568
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,240
again

569
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,120
same mistakes guys leaving credentials

570
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,419
in text files putting it in Dropbox uh

571
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,500
not rotating Keys giving everyone admin

572
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,779
access these are all things we keep on

573
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,640
seeing over and over again we have to

574
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,059
stop with this relying on code we didn't

575
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,820
write remember the chaos we had a few

576
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,340
months ago around log4j

577
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,799
remember that just a couple of months

578
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,220
ago OCTA the service that all of us are

579
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,419
using got hacked and through that hack

580
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:06,000
their customers got attacked so this is

581
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,900
a

582
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,720
sadly a good example to using third

583
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
parties this

584
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
is this is crazy but this is the world

585
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,919
that we live in

586
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,659
misconfiguration and architecture to me

587
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,840
they mean that we just have to plan

588
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,720
ahead and threat model

589
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,360
and we also have a dedicated OS

590
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,059
resources on that that you can feel free

591
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,480
to use

592
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,200
um now

593
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,840
where are we going with this you're

594
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,760
probably wondering what does this mean

595
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,520
to you and what can you do to improve

596
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,500
your application security posture in the

597
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,679
cloud so here is my take on this first

598
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,080
of all shifting left

599
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,539
we talk about it all the time but still

600
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,059
we find it very very very hard to

601
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,039
implement we'll be seeing more

602
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,260
developers finding themselves touching

603
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,600
the infrastructure not because they want

604
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,600
to replace the devops but because they

605
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
want to move faster and if we want them

606
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,360
to move faster and to deliver faster we

607
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,400
need to enable them with the security

608
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,760
with a secured way to do it so we will

609
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,179
need to implement automated

610
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,320
devsecops and infrastructure security

611
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,620
tools to make their life easier and to

612
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,600
make our life the security people life

613
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,799
less stressful

614
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,460
um I mentioned the term Plumbing before

615
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,860
this is a the terminology that I like to

616
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,080
use in the case of talking about

617
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,299
different services and components that

618
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,520
we didn't write we connect them together

619
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,720
and call this an application uh the more

620
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,120
we use the cloud the more we use managed

621
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,399
Services the more we use SAS Solutions

622
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,580
as a part of our application this is

623
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,559
more Plumbing that we are doing and we

624
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,740
need to learn how is the data flowing

625
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,799
exactly where to filter it how to

626
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,200
identify a leakage how to make sure that

627
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,500
only the necessary access is granted I

628
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
think we'll be seeing a lot more

629
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,140
Plumbing issues so to speak in the

630
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,320
future so prepare yourselves and prepare

631
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
your team for this mindset of becoming a

632
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,879
security plumbers

633
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,820
uh last but not least we are all using

634
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,760
third parties all the time at the end of

635
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,659
the day

636
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:36,740
if I if OCTA got hacked so who are we

637
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,720
and through through OCTA their customers

638
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,200
so actually no one is immune to these

639
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,620
kind of things no one I don't rely on my

640
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,620
vendors and I don't rely on my external

641
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,919
products to keep me secured this is our

642
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,779
responsibility to make sure that our

643
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,179
infrastructure our backend our data are

644
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,080
all secured we're not going to QA the

645
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,720
other products we are not going to pen

646
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,779
test the other products while we go

647
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,399
through an audit I mean unless you

648
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,559
really want to I don't think it is our

649
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,580
job to pen test the other products

650
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,440
um so always remember that you are

651
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,779
responsible for your own application and

652
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,260
keep in mind that those third parties

653
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,299
might and might not be secured and the

654
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,279
fact that they are compliant to

655
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,559
something doesn't mean that they are

656
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,020
secured and secured enough and securing

657
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,240
the standards that you would like them

658
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,260
or you would hope they are secured

659
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,899
um always prepare yourself for a

660
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,320
potential breach or potential hack

661
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,240
and I think that this is not news to you

662
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,340
security is like an onion you have

663
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,860
layers and layers and layers you can

664
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,500
never have a hundred percent

665
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,559
um so keep in mind that you should also

666
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,500
know in which layer did you keep the

667
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,080
data and what kind of layers did you put

668
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,080
around it and where are the third

669
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,080
parties around those layers and what

670
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,640
kind of security layers are you putting

671
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,159
around them to mitigate

672
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,260
potential future

673
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,059
um risks

674
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,279
so at this

675
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,159
I would like to thank you today for

676
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,419
joining me to a journey in time

677
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:29,480
from OS 2000 from OS top 10 2007 until

678
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,100
2021

679
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,720
uh I will be taking some questions now

680
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,000
and if anyone wants to reach out to me

681
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,320
later over LinkedIn over Twitter please

682
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,779
feel free to do so

683
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,260
thank you so much sincere so I hope

684
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,539
everybody so we have some questions from

685
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:52,020
the customers I haven't attendees uh one

686
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,000
is the first one is

687
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
um over the years there are mobile top

688
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,539
10 the API to ten the docker top 10

689
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:01,620
shouldn't this be considered

690
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,419
consolidated

691
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,419
or other guidelines that tell

692
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,120
what to follow for What on how to avoid

693
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,080
confusion or increase awareness uh I

694
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,880
think that this is the challenge that

695
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,480
any security practitioner is facing I

696
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,760
can tell you that I'm here at RSA right

697
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,980
now and you look at you work at the Expo

698
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,519
you have dozens of security

699
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,380
companies telling you about the

700
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,940
importance of the risk that they're

701
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,000
going to mitigate and resolve for you at

702
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,539
the end of the day you know your

703
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,340
application and you know your crown

704
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,960
jewels and you need to work your way

705
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,899
around it it always has

706
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,480
very good and very up-to-date resources

707
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,700
for example if you go and take a look at

708
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,820
the other OS projects not only the top

709
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,159
10 but the API top 10 the serverless top

710
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,500
10 you will be seeing some commonality

711
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,240
there are some mistakes that repeat

712
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,899
themselves and we see them in every

713
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,760
project right so authentication is

714
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,100
something that we see everywhere so if

715
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,080
you decide and I think that you should

716
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,239
tackle authentication and make sure you

717
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,980
do it correctly

718
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,139
if you do it once uh it it covers a

719
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,080
other security aspects as well so there

720
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,719
I I wish there was one single source of

721
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,659
Truth for the top 10 things everyone

722
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,520
should be doing in their application but

723
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,839
it really differs you know some

724
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,179
applications are on premise some in the

725
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,940
cloud and some also have a mobile

726
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,060
application and some don't have any pii

727
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,719
so their risks are totally different

728
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,339
their potential of damage is totally

729
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,080
different

730
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,020
um so I just think that you need to

731
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,119
analyze your application threat model

732
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,580
your application and then start

733
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,440
obviously with the most with the things

734
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,859
that could cause the biggest damage and

735
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,960
can give you the quickest or maybe not

736
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,240
the quickest but the biggest impact on

737
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,000
your security and start with that

738
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,820
yeah if I may add so it's indeed we have

739
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,560
about risk in the context and of course

740
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,119
in several contexts you have the same

741
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,820
risk but I would like to point out it's

742
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,300
an OS Project it's the open cre the open

743
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,240
common requirement and variation it's

744
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,339
kind of linking the requirements where

745
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,800
they come from by conduct so it's not a

746
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
one-on-one mapping but the mapping like

747
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,520
we have there for example authentication

748
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,619
you can see where the requirements of

749
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,420
authentication come from by what

750
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,980
standard or which version of what's that

751
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,020
not I will put it at the answers as well

752
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,760
it's nice one to add

753
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,820
right okay the next question was

754
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,220
perhaps about the future uh the

755
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,040
prediction perhaps insecure software

756
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,380
supply chain will be on the list in the

757
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,260
future what do you think

758
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,820
I think that uh um

759
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,099
it's there it might be so I think that

760
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,440
any third party that we use software

761
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,099
supply chain but also you know also a

762
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,440
cloud infrastructure I look at it as a

763
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,900
third party it's not exactly software in

764
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,500
this in the sense that we copy and paste

765
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,240
from stack Overflow and put it into our

766
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,320
application but if you think about a

767
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,220
using AWS Cognito for example the

768
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,780
authentication Service that AWS has for

769
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,940
you what's behind it there is some code

770
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,940
that someone else wrote so I look at it

771
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,940
in a way just like you mentioned a the

772
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,960
third party a software

773
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,420
supply chain I look at using a managed

774
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,640
service the same way because this is at

775
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,900
the end of the day a piece of code

776
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,960
someone else wrote so I think there is

777
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,180
definitely room to put in the field

778
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,200
future always top 10 using any kind of

779
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,320
third-party Service as a part of your

780
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,900
application this is a supply chain issue

781
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,220
I might mention one very interesting

782
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,060
incident that happened a few months back

783
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,640
AWS someone at AWS accidentally I

784
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,280
assumed it was an accident anyway it

785
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,300
made a change to the security

786
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,839
policy for S3 bucket for the support

787
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,900
role they accidentally added a

788
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,400
permission to read items out of S3 so

789
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,800
for some time if you used the support

790
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,140
role for S3

791
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,740
AWS employees were able to read items

792
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,280
out of your S3 bucket

793
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,800
so this is to me it's a third party big

794
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,680
issue and

795
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,200
when we talk about mitigating the third

796
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,900
party risks thinking about the roles

797
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,599
that you have enabled in your account

798
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,880
and maybe not allowing the service

799
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,300
support for AWS to be active all the

800
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
time is an interesting layer in the

801
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,579
onion and you don't have to enable it

802
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,020
all the time you can enable it just when

803
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,339
you need it

804
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:06,000
now I I like the security onion uh just

805
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,400
think about that it's a mems about the

806
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
security onion I also when I uh to this

807
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,260
point is when you say talk about supply

808
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,599
chain I was wondering when it came out

809
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,540
because I know that many years ago Josh

810
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,160
Coleman of iron Curry talked about

811
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,980
supply chain cleannessness and headed

812
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,500
with uh alignment of the car industry

813
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,940
where one uh brand has less suppliers a

814
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,500
much more external part the other one

815
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,359
has less external Parts but more

816
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,680
different suppliers so the one that goes

817
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,599
for Quality the other one the the

818
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,460
pricing and then you see the differences

819
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,700
so you have to have what do I import and

820
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,339
that's for also 10 2017 as you showed it

821
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:45,960
they had a using components of

822
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,720
non-vulnerabilities and now it's the let

823
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,000
me see it's the A6 it's vulnerable

824
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,099
outdated components so definitely supply

825
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,680
chain and this external components it's

826
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,480
more on the radar now definitely for

827
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,000
attackers open source right yeah

828
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,700
everybody is allowed to contribute and

829
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,140
we all did this for the best and now

830
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,520
people will use it for the worse

831
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,280
definitely another question we have is

832
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,380
is the current release cycle of the auto

833
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,440
10 three to four years enough for the

834
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,200
future what do you think

835
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,720
it's a great question uh

836
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,180
um I think that

837
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,599
in theory we could have updated it maybe

838
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,460
every year or two but would you run a

839
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,220
very thorough assessment every year or

840
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,079
two I think that organizations don't do

841
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,320
it that frequently uh

842
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,099
um

843
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,220
so at the end of the day the OS top 10

844
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,359
is kind of a mirror

845
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,579
to what we are seeing

846
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,000
um maybe maybe three to four years is

847
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,280
too long and we can shorten it but I

848
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,359
don't think that every year is uh

849
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,760
necessary in the sense that are we

850
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,160
really going to take action based on a

851
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,040
new hours top 10 every year I'm not sure

852
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,119
about it

853
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,000
but Martin what do you think yeah I

854
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,560
think we usually take actions I'm always

855
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,839
worrying about people demanding like hey

856
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,640
we always have 10 and now I was checking

857
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040
all of our application security posts

858
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,300
whatever it

859
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,940
augment people get it's not a complete

860
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,099
list it's an advanced document and if

861
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,859
you base your security portion also 10

862
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,960
it's like you trust one tool for your

863
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,339
security validation right on your

864
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,619
Instagram you want to call it I was

865
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,000
scared about people calling this because

866
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,400
it's an awareness document use it it's

867
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,920
not a choose it's not a complete set of

868
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,339
requirements but you know so yeah it's

869
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,079
like

870
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,339
cringing my teeth when I hear people

871
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,020
like I think that say something about

872
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,599
the maturity of the most companies

873
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,240
um another good question I heard is like

874
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,220
what do you think about a single biggest

875
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,260
concern for organizations running in the

876
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,940
cloud

877
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,480
I

878
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,420
um so we talked a little bit before

879
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,180
about the plumbing and connecting

880
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,060
different components very often in our

881
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,820
Cloud application we connect we not only

882
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,460
connect components from the AWS

883
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,099
Marketplace the the different services

884
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,780
that are available there but we even

885
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,300
connect external Services external

886
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:32,000
vendors external SAS products external

887
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,880
AWS account and we do this connectivity

888
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,780
in the cloud using uh roles and policies

889
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,780
and not policy like I don't allow it to

890
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,339
connect to the internet but a role in

891
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,740
the policy is a part of IAM identity and

892
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,320
access management and I think that today

893
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,320
the really nasty AWS or Cloud native

894
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,160
hacks but also the really good security

895
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,400
mechanism to fight it is identity and

896
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,740
access management and this mechanism

897
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,140
exists in AWS in Azure in GC in in gcp

898
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,960
everyone should make sure

899
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,740
that their Provisions don't have too

900
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,660
many holes in them or don't have any

901
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,320
holes in them if if possible

902
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,720
I think that the biggest failures that

903
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,300
are Cloud native not I forgot my

904
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,060
credentials there in my code in GitHub

905
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,060
but the cloud native incidents happen

906
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,480
because we have enabled too much access

907
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,040
to our Crown Jewel and resources

908
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,480
the example that I gave before about

909
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,660
giving the ec2 machine admin permissions

910
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,540
I have I know someone in their company

911
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,660
I'm not gonna say who that for all of

912
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,420
their Lambda functions they use the same

913
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,220
role

914
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,200
the LA each Lambda is doing something

915
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,940
different if you use the same rule for

916
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,319
all the lambdas I can take one of them

917
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,500
exploit it create myself as the attacker

918
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,420
with admin permissions you will never

919
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,940
know about it

920
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,020
so the cloud gave us this great power of

921
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,180
creating an identity for every cloud

922
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,119
component we are using it the wrong way

923
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,640
so theoretically speaking I can take one

924
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,339
component in your Cloud application and

925
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,579
help make it assume a role that can

926
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,740
assume an admin role and I can take over

927
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,200
the entire account people are unaware of

928
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,660
this and it's very very very simple to

929
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,060
fix and to prevent

930
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,300
so I think that this is the single uh

931
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,060
point of failure but also the the place

932
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,280
that would give you the best security

933
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,839
value for your time

934
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,460
I think it's a perfect loopback to our

935
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,040
opening keynote about the inside stress

936
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,339
because of what Lisa said back then she

937
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,440
sees companies they fire somebody or

938
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,700
somebody will be laid out for whatever

939
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,800
reason and they said oh everything is

940
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,079
good because PA disabled account or the

941
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,000
accountability password will be reset

942
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,339
anyway after several weeks and they

943
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,839
forget they have the non-profit the

944
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,700
non-personal in the service accounts

945
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,220
externally right oh we have the shared

946
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,440
account on this external service they

947
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,119
haven't thought about it and it's an

948
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,740
interesting one yeah

949
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,579
yeah

950
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:21,660
um

951
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,880
let me see

952
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,980
I have to seen many companies that do a

953
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,060
lift and shift so they're taking

954
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,940
applications as is and do it loud

955
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,920
because I already cost a lot of money

956
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,579
right what do you think about that

957
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:38,400
it's funny I a while ago I was talking

958
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,079
to someone from one of the big cloud

959
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,780
vendors and they shared the statistics I

960
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,540
was not unaware of they told me that

961
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:51,359
about 70 percent of uh the compute power

962
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,460
today is still on-prem not in the cloud

963
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,500
I thought it would be the other way

964
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,359
around I thought most is in the cloud

965
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,079
and a little bit is still on-prem so I

966
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,819
think that first of all lift and shift

967
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,160
is still a big challenge I thought that

968
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,200
I mean I was under the conception that

969
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,720
now the challenge is cloud native lift

970
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,579
and shift is still a problem it's a big

971
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,980
problem and

972
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,960
yes there is a challenge because if you

973
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,200
lift and shift the architecture and the

974
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,180
technology from the on-prem and just

975
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,980
make it run in the cloud you are not

976
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,099
enjoying the benefit of the cloud and

977
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,020
I'm not even talking about Security even

978
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,619
the cost is not optimized if you just

979
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,839
lift and shift I know that sometimes you

980
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,520
have no choice and you have to start it

981
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,280
this way and

982
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,540
re-architecture and rewrite the

983
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,960
application later on yes it happens and

984
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,119
I think that when thinking about lifting

985
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,220
and shifting and migrating to the cloud

986
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,800
always remember there is no place for

987
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,560
you to connect your firewall anymore it

988
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,700
works differently and you have to if you

989
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,319
don't have the knowledge in-house you

990
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,960
need to bring in a the consultant that

991
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,579
will give you that will give you again

992
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,859
the the in the the things that will

993
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,980
quickly give you the value of just you

994
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,599
know making sure that what you have here

995
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,000
that you just lifted and shifted is

996
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,060
secured I think that the cloud vendors

997
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,859
can give some help in that extent uh

998
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:23,819
it's difficult consider uh rewriting the

999
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,460
application if it makes sense in your

1000
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,880
organization I think that sometimes it's

1001
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,099
not as difficult as you think you put

1002
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,680
some things in a container put your data

1003
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,280
in a in a cloud database and things are

1004
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,819
going to work smoothly from now on

1005
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:44,760
um just remember that if you lifted and

1006
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,220
shifted some things you had in the

1007
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,040
on-prem like code and packages that you

1008
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,319
had over there and sometimes people

1009
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,140
migrate to a global applications to the

1010
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,560
cloud it doesn't always make sense so

1011
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,079
think carefully before you do it

1012
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,079
okay yeah I think that's also a good

1013
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,760
question is when you look at the clicks

1014
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,900
and shift so you said what is the

1015
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,640
overlapping of the application Security

1016
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,480
in Cloud security

1017
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:12,960
um

1018
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,380
the overlapping look the code is code

1019
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,319
right if your code is vulnerable it is

1020
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,819
going to be vulnerable in the container

1021
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,880
in the cloud or in the basement in your

1022
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,180
office and always is still about

1023
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,720
applications right so the code that you

1024
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,579
write or the code that you copy and

1025
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:33,920
paste

1026
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,480
you need to make sure it's not uh

1027
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,000
vulnerable and that you understand the

1028
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,940
risks that you put inside

1029
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,099
remember that there was an company that

1030
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,040
tries to have this hard environment

1031
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,319
whatever how bad your code is you can

1032
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,420
deploy it and the environment will take

1033
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,720
care it's more secure and unfortunately

1034
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,940
it didn't work out I would have loved to

1035
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,099
see the word but it was kind of awkward

1036
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,780
anyhow there's one more question it's

1037
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,180
like on the principle of police I'm

1038
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,000
sorry and the principle of least

1039
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,760
privileges on the plumbing which

1040
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,700
strategies do you think work best in a

1041
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,560
dynamic environment

1042
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,420
for example a principle of police

1043
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,339
privileges in a secure groups for the

1044
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,040
kubernetes

1045
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,180
okay so list privileges is a it's a very

1046
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,339
important principle if you're building a

1047
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,319
cloud native application the the cloud

1048
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,140
vendors came up with it as a part of the

1049
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,119
shared responsibility model they tell

1050
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,980
you hey we are responsible for bare

1051
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,240
metal you're responsible for everything

1052
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,020
else and you make sure that

1053
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,140
permissions are always reduced so I

1054
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,720
think there are some even open source

1055
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,660
tools to help you

1056
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,200
um

1057
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,599
try and look where you can reduce

1058
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,140
security permissions and

1059
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,800
for example Netflix released some open

1060
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,640
source tools that can help you see which

1061
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,119
permissions are being used and which

1062
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,220
ones are not and

1063
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,520
statistically you might be able to to

1064
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,920
reduce them

1065
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,760
um and and it makes sense if you want to

1066
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,000
um make your application list privilege

1067
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,119
or Lister to take a look at one of these

1068
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,520
open source tools I can look for my I

1069
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,740
have a list of the open source tools

1070
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,380
that I had good experience with so I can

1071
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,660
publish it

1072
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,380
later on Twitter so you can take a look

1073
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,760
um and see if if either one helps you

1074
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,300
okay that's a Fairgrounds

1075
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,180
she has so much thank you for that nice

1076
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,359
talk and Q a uh long q a sorry for that

1077
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,460
thanks everybody for listening the whole

1078
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,619
day I hope you had learned so for the

1079
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,660
morning the very nice opening sessions

1080
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,420
from Lisa 14 now we have said Shira

1081
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,579
Saban for closing session tomorrow

1082
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:05,220
morning I'm again here to open the

1083
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,380
conference with a keynote from Astrid

1084
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,700
ozenberg it's a 9 A.M in Ireland UK time

1085

1086
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,940
sure thank you again thanks for all you

1087
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,040
