14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,780
I helped run the DevOps days and

15
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:36,910
serverless days in Austin Texas and

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,860
we're about to have a devstack ops days

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,269
in Austin Texas and we'd love to have

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,769

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,270
you go well oh and I'll have one slide

39
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:29,619
in here to tell you what Varrick is

40
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,569
because we're a brand-new startup and

41
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,149
we're an enterprise platform for

42
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,859
continuous verification using chaos

43
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:37,659
engineering principles to take a

44
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,579
measured and proactive approach to

45
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,439
preventing availability and security

46
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,880
incidents so we're really excited about

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,619
that we're excited about the process of

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,479
where we're going and maybe some of that

49
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,249
I'll come out as we go through but

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,509
before we get started and and before we

51
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,199
start talking about devstack ops when we

52
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,270
talk about anything

53
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,849
I thought we could like talk about

54
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,949
something a little more historic

55
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:58,719
something that's been that's it happened

56
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,309
a long time ago and I wanted to

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,779
originally call this talk like a tale of

58
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:07,209
money chaos and whoa then kind of

59
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:10,060
changed it up a little bit but in the

60
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,899
day in the year of 1896 almost to the

61
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,819
day

62
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,209
this coming Sunday is gonna be

63
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:18,910
anniversary there was there's this man

64
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,330
who came up with this idea that they

65
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,970
were gonna Ram these two trains together

66
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,180
as a demolition experience so this is a

67
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,280
William crush William crush is a ticket

68
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,819
agent for the Missouri Kansas Texas

69
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,879
railway often referred to the Katey back

70
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:41,349
in the day and William crush was just a

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,609
passenger agent and and they the Katie

72
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,099
knew that they want to expand their

73
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,870
their influence and their their reach

74
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,310
across the state of Texas and they

75
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,019
needed some promotion to do that and

76
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,400
crushed had kind of been watching the

77
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,670
newspapers he'd seen some other things

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,349
going on in the in the world and and

79
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,328
that was that was interesting he saw

80
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,069
these other people trying to run run

81
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,360
trains together and he knew that they

82
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,700
had some spare engines laying around

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,590
that they were gonna be retired so he

84
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,530
thought he thought well why don't we why

85
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,900
don't we get those and and for this

86
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,489
promotional purpose we're gonna jam

87
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,260
these trains together so it's gonna be

88
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,170
like a demolition derby

89
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,429
but for trains and this was not you know

90
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,010
like I said it's not wasn't the first

91
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,660
time that that anybody had come up with

92
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,950
this idea but this is the first time

93
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,950
that I think that we saw it be

94
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,920
successful sort of in a way but the idea

95
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,328
was happened in Ohio several times but

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,849
they struggled with the idea because

97
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,170
they were like try to charge tickets but

98
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,608
like you're Raymond to trains together

99
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,500
so you really have to block off a big

100
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,480
area and so people were like climbing up

101
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,950
in trees to watch it and sometimes they

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
wouldn't even end up ramming the trains

103
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,040
together because of the financers are

104
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,220
like okay we don't have enough ticket

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,750
sales for this so crushes innovation the

106
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,190
whole thing was the freemium model he's

107
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,010
like we're just going to make the whole

108
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,079
the whole thing free if you if you want

109
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,060
to come and watch these trains you know

110
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,099
just come on down we got a spot for you

111
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,440
Texas has got a lot of land he found

112
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,108
found a place good hills around it that

113
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,989
all the crowds could gather the big kind

114
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,639
of natural almost like a natural place

115
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,880
to see this and they they ran there the

116
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,440
trains line through there so so

117
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,849
overnight you know so the the railway

118
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,168
loved it like the Katy is like all right

119
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,659
like you're gonna jam some trains

120
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,608
together there's gonna be big

121
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,710
promotional event they booked it like

122
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,888
four or five months out they started

123
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,659
started working on the kicker here was

124
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,860
you know he goes from from this pasture

125
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,979
agent like big tent promoter

126
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,970
extraordinaire and he they said well

127
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,469
this is a great idea we're just gonna

128
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,169
name the town right after you so they

129
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,050
called they called it crush Texas and it

130
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,448
was a city for a day all of one day and

131
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,639
they sold these tickets tickets from

132
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,310
from Dallas to crush Texas and her

133
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,259
crushes it was located right in outside

134
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,729
of West Texas which it sounds like a

135
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,100
direction but West Texas is actually a

136
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:57,430
town and it's in between Austin and

137
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,680
Dallas if you're thinking about that so

138
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,180
the idea was we're not gonna make money

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,979
on the actual event we're gonna make

140
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,870
money on all the ticket sales and so

141
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,030
they sold a lot of tickets

142
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,220
they sold so many tickets that it was

143
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,130
the largest exhibition in the state of

144
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,930
Texas that ever happened and 40,000

145
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,610
people the estimates range from thirty

146
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,169
to fifty thousand but a lot of people

147
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,710
think it was about forty thousand people

148
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,960
came to crush Texas to watch this whole

149
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,638
thing go down

150
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,659
so crush you know put on his put on his

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,150
hat and he said all right well what are

152
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,740
we gonna do to make this happen I you

153
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,030
know it's gonna be kind of rowdy I mean

154
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,160
forty thousand people even today like

155
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,809
that's like RSA sized event right so

156
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,639
like that's a big event so we're gonna

157
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,070
need some police officers and they built

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,520
a makeshift jail they drilled a bunch of

159
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:45,060
water wells to help make sure no one no

160
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,198
one got you know dehydrated or anything

161
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,880
brought in water tankers from outside

162
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,409
brought in some concessions some

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,750
lemonade stands from Dallas I think ten

164
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,940
of those were brought in from from a guy

165
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,139
up there preachers and politicians

166
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,449
descended on there and there was a

167
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,760
Midway that had games cigars as a

168
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,760
carnival all sorts thing big festival of

169
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,139
festivity so on the business model

170
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,760
didn't stop there so he had he had the

171
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,380
ticket revenue he had the concession

172
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,210
revenue and then now he added

173
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,770
advertising revenue these are the two

174
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,770
trains and he was gonna jam together he

175
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,599
he you can see over there on the far on

176
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,549
the far right-hand side there are some

177
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,979
advertisements on those who can't see it

178
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,570
too clearly but he started selling

179
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:26,289
banner ads you know if we were to think

180
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,030
about it in our parlance right and crush

181
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,699
was concerned about safety

182
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,049
he understood like this is this is a

183
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,520
thing where people could get hurt not

184
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,599
just from getting dehydrated and

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,799
standing out there watching these trains

186
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,319
get jammed together

187
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,860
but you know boilers explode this is a

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,280
shot for the train engine in the 1850s

189
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,389
we're just the boiler exploded and at

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,679
that point you may be thinking well

191
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,650
what's you know what's going on here

192
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,419
this is a all the pipes kind of running

193
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,448
vertically they kind of convey all the

194
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:58,900
steam that steam gets turned in to power

195
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,069
to push the wheels and this would just

196
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,739
happen sometimes like you're just

197
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,330
driving down the down the you know on

198
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,150
your way and here's some Klunk Klunk s--

199
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,258
and then all of a sudden the the train

200
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,840
explodes and now you're and now you're

201
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,639
in a kind of a dire situation so it's

202
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,340
not like the idea of boilers exploding

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,740
or novel or new like crushing you to

204
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,419
think about that so we had engineers

205
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,210
come and look at the boilers and they

206
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,409
said yeah these look good he laid four

207
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,630
miles of track because he also didn't

208
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,009
want like the catastrophe to spread

209
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,139
outside of the two engines he didn't

210
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,319
want it to take down the train the train

211
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,819
tracks he wanted to be able to still

212
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,770
have service to and from the event so he

213
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,819
they laid four miles of brand-new track

214
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,340
that they were gonna run these trains

215
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,409
together at he kept the crowd back at

216
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,789
200 yards he let the press come in a

217
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:46,030
little closer at a hundred yards to get

218
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,560
better photos and and then word got out

219
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,630
about this event and so could they're

220
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,009
the you know he went to a big promoting

221
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,840
type type role and Edison Thomas Edison

222
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,360
wanted to film it he and he had a

223
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,159
Kinetoscope this is the device they used

224
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,199
to display it but they took a

225
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,139
kinetograph they're not Edison himself

226
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,370
but one of his one of his students I

227
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:13,150
think or his one of his employees and so

228
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:17,169
on on the 4th of 4 p.m. on September

229
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:21,340
15th in 1896 the trains were released to

230
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:23,020
come together one of the reporters that

231
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,409
was on the scene they said the rumble of

232
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,599
the two trains faint and far off at

233
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:30,250
first it would faint and far off at

234
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,529
first but growing nearer and more

235
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,419
distinct with each fleeting second it

236
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,179
was like the gathering force of a

237
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:40,838
cyclone and they captured this image

238
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:42,728
right before the the trains you know

239
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,320
collided and it's a it's a pretty great

240
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,990
image considering the technology of the

241
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,760
day right

242
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:52,040
and you see this and so and they

243
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,470
collided at a speed between 90 miles an

244
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,310
hour and 120 miles an hour the estimates

245
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:02,900
are kind of range on that and and it was

246
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,849
a big explosion really big and but one

247
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,100
second right after that initial

248
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,710
explosion there was a subsequent

249
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,950
explosion and both of the boilers and

250
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,240
both engines also exploded and that was

251
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,340
we showed a picture of the boiler in

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,130
like real life but here it is a diagram

253
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,850
of it and it was common for like if you

254
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,260
got any cracks on the you know along the

255
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,090
walls or in the welds or if there was

256
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,350
any rust inside and so as I started

257
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,550
researching this I started kind of

258
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,080
geeking out was like well how do boilers

259
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,030
explode well you know how did this all

260
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,900
work right and so you you kind of go

261
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,430
down the process but you see this is

262
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,800
actually the the boilers this is not

263
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,620
just the Train you know exploding this

264
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,099
is the the boilers exploding now

265
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:49,640
propelling all sorts of straddle across

266
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,170
the sky and you know is the steam and

267
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,150
the iron and the wood just filled the

268
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,439
sky and it started to rain down on all

269
00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:00,920
the crowds of course they're Texans so

270
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,440
after the dust settled they wanted to go

271
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,500
get a souvenir so then they hey they

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
rush the the scene of the accident not

273
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,800
to be held back and then they also got

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,140
burned from that because it was still

275
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,949
hot you know so injuries were sustained

276
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:19,640
on all sides and the there's restaurants

277
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,770
about four people that died of the other

278
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,370
aftermath and followed from this crush

279
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,930
was fired widespread injuries during the

280
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,250
incident then you know more injuries

281
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,819
after the incident after everybody's

282
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,080
trying to collect their their souvenir

283
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,540
crush Texas was immediately shut down

284
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,250
the Katie lawyers and and

285
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,410
representatives were brought in and they

286
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,700
they started to work out the settlements

287
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,850
with everybody and get all the details

288
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,350
done there's a couple days later when

289
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,940
they say alright we got to pull up the

290
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,290
tracks and now when you go there there's

291
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,920
there's nothing there like there's

292
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,959
nothing in the field and we have the

293
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,550
sign and I think things in the 80s they

294
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,980
had to sign out kind of in the middle of

295
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,020
nowhere where the site actually was

296
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,400
out of the outside of the eye 35 in

297
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,930
Texas but then they ended up moving it

298
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,280
into the town of West because like no

299
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,430
one ever actually went out there it's

300
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,420
still just a big empty field so this is

301
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:13,219
uh this is what we've been left with so

302
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:17,719
more fallout happened in the days the

303
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:21,050
days following so crush later was

304
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,510
rehired by the Katie and he worked there

305
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,099
for forty four more years so the the

306
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,500
firing didn't stick because it turned

307
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,000
out that no one really blamed him for it

308
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,700
and it was just sort of a more of a move

309
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,870
a political move to cover their their

310
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,580
bases there for the Train and and after

311
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,400
this happened it was actually deemed as

312
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,500
a success oddly enough demolition derby

313
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,020
via trains started become a national

314
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,970
phenomenon hundreds of other city would

315
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,860
think like ok cool they're gonna say hey

316
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,810
guys stop stop doing that like stop

317
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,370
ramming trains together but no they they

318
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,150
decided like no we're gonna keep keep

319
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,500
this up but in the events the the

320
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,110
hundred of events that happened post

321
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,250
crush all the boilers held so it's not

322
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,450
like it was a crazy idea to do this in

323
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,780
the first place like that you know it

324
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:11,900
was possible to do this without having

325
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,579
mass chaos and death and and all that so

326
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,740
alright and all this what can we learn

327
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,620
what is it these are some things that I

328
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,910
took away from it first off like we we

329
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,320
have Chrono centrism

330
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,030
which you know we think that our

331
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,020
generation and our time were smarter you

332
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,980
know because when I first started

333
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,960
reading this and started going through

334
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,390
this I read about it you're like oh yeah

335
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,550
like why you know why would you why

336
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,010
would you do this like that's a bad idea

337
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,829
also engineering is hard right we think

338
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,750
that that you know they obviously got

339
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,550
the engineering right to get the the

340
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,420
crash happen in the right spot where

341
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,479
everybody could view it the

342
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,040
photographers could take the pictures

343
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,090
they could try to try to video it for

344
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,089
the first time which would have been the

345
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,430
if if the video had to survive which it

346
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,430
didn't for medicine it would be the

347
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,900
first like special effect ever recorded

348
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,290
also blame is really easy like you can

349
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,209
you know just fire somebody or you can

350
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,730
sort of you know use that as an option

351
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,350
to to deal with the problems but it's

352
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,450
not really a fair a fair way to deal

353
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,480
with it and it also taught me like root

354
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,300
causes a myth like who is the main cause

355
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,580
for this like was it was it crush was

356
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,229
that the the people at the the Katie who

357
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,010
approved the whole event was it the

358
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,470
engineers who evaluated the the engines

359
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:28,250
to say that they were safe to do the

360
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,350
crash the or was a part of society like

361
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,030
wanting to see this kind of thing it's

362
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,910
hard to hard analyze in this sort of

363
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:37,959
situation who really would do that who

364
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,160
is really at fault in that scenario and

365
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,130
when you're thinking of socio-economic

366
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,530
and socio technical systems like that

367
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,590
that sort of overlays and over maps to

368
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:51,740
that so I also believe that like

369
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,480
breaches and failures or accidents or

370
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,010
whatever that doesn't stop business and

371
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,530
we saw that like they continued to keep

372
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,240
on going and and have some progress

373
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,620
where they where they're able to have a

374
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,680
lot more of these type of events later

375
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,500
on and the late 1800s and be successful

376
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,880
and also the last thing I came away from

377
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,540
this is that experimentation and

378
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,830
learning are critical for us and if you

379
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,480
could they could have done some sort of

380
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,130
smaller scale experiments like that

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,660
would have been a better better play

382
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:26,000
there okay cool well yeh trains right

383
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,819
okay yeah well okay

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,110
I was hoping that would be funnier cool

385
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,490
so Deb sack ops well where does this all

386
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,660
fit in with Deb psych ops and like we

387
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,920
have all these learnings we can think

388
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,630
about this event that happened you know

389
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,610
100 years ago hundred twenty three years

390
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,530
ago but what does that really mean for

391
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,820
us what does that mean for us today how

392
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,140
do we think about this thing that we're

393
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,750
left with they were now dealing and

394
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,540
talking about called Deb suck-ups and I

395
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,880
think that I'd like to in the in the

396
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,010
words of my good friend Josh Zimmerman

397
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,650
and his DevOps deep thoughts I thought

398
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,800
I'd like to to think about what DEP SEC

399
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:04,189
Ops means maybe in order to understand

400
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,910
dev SEC ops we have to look at the word

401
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:11,779
itself basically it's made up of three

402
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:18,990
separate words day

403
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:22,230
vasenka and well what do those words

404
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:26,640
mean it's a mystery and that's why so is

405
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,930
dev Chekhov's and so we're left with it

406
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,329
and we're thinking why do we have this

407
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,069
what does this mean well first I think

408
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,569
we could look at DevOps and understand

409
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,010
how we got there and that might inform

410
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,720
us like why we think dev SEC ops is

411
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,339
important and and how we can live with

412
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,890
it so this is gonna be a real special

413
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,380
time for us first we had the cloud and

414
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,660
it was great and we saw it and we loved

415
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,490
it and the data it just got so big and

416
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,640
we were thinking this is awesome you

417
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,589
know now and now our new OSI model is

418
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,420
really a lot easier to understand which

419
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:56,010
I am this is my favorite part of it all

420
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,069
because I was really always struggling

421
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,019
before and then we have this thing

422
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,230
called service that came out that let us

423
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:09,750
move our our consumption and and payment

424
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:12,149
closer to what we're actually using Tom

425
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,920
lemon Shelly says this he says DevOps is

426
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,600
inevitable result of needing to do

427
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,209
efficient operations in a distributed

428
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,010
computing and cloud environment so when

429
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,270
we have a single person managing ten and

430
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,339
hundreds of computers is fine are you

431
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,740
doing thousands not so fine you need

432
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,180
something different but Damon Edward's

433
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,459
always reminds us that DevOps is not a

434
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,399
technical problem DevOps is a business

435
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,290
problem I like to think of it as a

436
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,660
piston an epistemological breakthrough

437
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,779
where you joined to to despaired groups

438
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,670
of people around a common problem

439
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,230
DevOps was needed to fix also the

440
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,490
inevitable distribution of labor that we

441
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,300
often experience where you'd have ten

442
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,829
developers to one operation person and I

443
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,359
also think that you know DevOps is just

444
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,620
another way point you could think of it

445
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,120
this way is it's just another way point

446
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,290
on the journey of agile across the

447
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,360
business and and to find value that ok

448
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,189
fine maybe you're convinced maybe not

449
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,110
but that's what that's what DevOps is

450
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,550
but why do we need devstack ops why is

451
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,500
it important and I asked myself the same

452
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,938
question I thought yeah this is just

453
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,400
going to get out of control like we're

454
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,130
gonna be stuck with this this scenario

455
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,929
and it's not going to be great for us

456
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,939
but a little bit of empathy also kicked

457
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,860
in like figuring that security itself is

458
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,240
finding itself security is finding

459
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,740
itself in the same position that

460
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,069
operations did in the early movement

461
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,110
DevOps so for every 100 developers you'd

462
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:33,309
have ten operations to one security

463
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:35,439
person there's a natural satellizer that

464
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:38,860
happens whenever you do this people are

465
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,210
throwing things over the wall and and

466
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,620
security like operations really

467
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,149
struggles to provide value and many

468
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,010
organizations this book Steve below even

469
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:50,379
that he wrote it's called thinking

470
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,330
security and there's two two quotes that

471
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,590
I like almost like to always use in any

472
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,408
presentation I give and this is one of

473
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,299
them he says companies are spending a

474
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:02,140
great deal on security but we read a

475
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,908
massive computer related attacks clearly

476
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,070
something is wrong and the root of the

477
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,750
problem is twofold we're protecting the

478
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,939
wrong things and we're hurting

479
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,549
productivity in the process does that

480
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,429
bother anybody here does that does that

481
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,139
hit home yeah right it's like we're

482
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,510
we're not stopping the problem the

483
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,770
breaches continue to get worse and we're

484
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,330
slowing everything down like in the

485
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,908
business doesn't always see security is

486
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,529
on their side the other one that I like

487
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:30,100
is Michael Zulu skis book the tangled

488
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:31,690
web in it in in the first chapter first

489
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,389
second chapter he walks through a

490
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,649
history of computing and says it kind of

491
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,080
goes through like in there and where

492
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,000
security was in the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s

493
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,270
but in the 90s we kind of hit this speed

494
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,130
bump and we have this this quote he says

495
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,168
security by risk assessment introduces a

496
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,149
dangerous fallacy that structured

497
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,490
inadequacy is almost as good as adequacy

498
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:53,408
and that underfunded security efforts

499
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,090
plus risk management are just about as

500
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:57,909
good as properly funded security work

501
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,918
and I read this quote many years ago and

502
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,690
it's always stuck with me as just a like

503
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,580
we don't want to do that we actually

504
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,140
want to do good engineering work we

505
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,320
don't we just want to just buy insurance

506
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,870
policies or do actuarial duties to deal

507
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,559
with our problems but that's what we're

508
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,209
often left doing last year late last

509
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,340
year sands came out with a report for

510
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,960
the deficit cops survey and it said

511
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,699
engineering while engineering teams are

512
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,230
busily deploying leading-edge technology

513
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,600
security teams are focused on fighting

514
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,659
yesterday's battles does that hit home

515
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,299
with anybody I kind of yeah yeah and

516
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:33,070
that that happens right and I know

517
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,918
people that go in on security

518
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,040
engagements or just engagements for

519
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,750
consulting

520
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,040
and they're like other they're talking

521
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,900
kubernetes Rockwell's what do you do for

522
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,580
security they're like I don't tell the

523
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,050
security people about our kubernetes

524
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,399
deployment they're like why it's like

525
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,690
cuz they'll get it all up in our

526
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,700
business and like we don't want that

527
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:54,890
right and it's like okay that's a real

528
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:56,750
problem and I think it's because one of

529
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,220
the things we often feel with security

530
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,570
is that many security teams work with

531
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,990
this worldview where their goal is to

532
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:07,490
inhibit change as much as possible and

533
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,160
it's kind of reasonable I mean we're

534
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,900
dealing with or it's it's reasonable to

535
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,270
see why we need this right we have new

536
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,330
technology that's coming about and we

537
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,129
have an increased organization focus on

538
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,720
software delivery and I think that's why

539
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,910
we really need dev suck-ups like we're

540
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,910
trying to produce at a faster speed we

541
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,650
have a lot more technology involved and

542
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,660
so we need something different and so

543
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,790
this is where I think that we need to

544
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,370
think of this new breed this this person

545
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,520
as the dev setup and I'd like to talk

546
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,280
like what I think the dev setup is talk

547
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,350
through a framework that I've worked on

548
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,060
for that but it's not a tool it's not

549
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,459
you can't buy it over in the expo hall

550
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,919
and I mean I know some people would

551
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,490
convince you otherwise but you can't buy

552
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,230
it over there it's not a CIC D pipeline

553
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:58,220
that maybe has some security tools you

554
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:00,200
know jammed in there and you know it is

555
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,930
something that is that we become and

556
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,610
it's something that we are that we are

557
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,070
dealing with as we kind of wrestle with

558
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,270
the idea of dev SEC ops and I like to

559
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,189
say it's an inclusive person

560
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,240
participating the movement of security

561
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,190
into DevOps

562
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,290
so I have this framework that I've been

563
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,750
working on it's that it's the measure

564
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,840
framework and we're gonna punch through

565
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,310
each of these and I don't want you to

566
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,679
take this as like you have to be doing

567
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,040
all all seven of these to be you know

568
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,140
fully like devstack ops not not even all

569
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,879
of them will fit but in the spirit of

570
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,990
like John Willis or John Willis and

571
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,030
Damon Edwards when they came out with

572
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,860
the cams model which is the culture

573
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,899
automation measurement and sharing and

574
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,540
then later clams because they added lean

575
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,180
in there I wanted to give us a way to

576
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,129
think about how devstack ops works how

577
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,470
we can sort of rationalize it when we're

578
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,950
dealing with in our business make

579
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,540
business cases for it and and put effort

580
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,900
and engineering behind different areas

581
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:59,240
of our of our software delivery and

582
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,540
development so what does measure mean it

583
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,210
means maker driven experimenting

584
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:09,320
automating and safety aware unrestrained

585
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:12,950
sharing rugged izing and empathy all

586
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,990
righty you guys ready yeah okay I

587
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,700
thought that'd be more exciting so we'll

588
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,470
see it was just it's good you know it's

589
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,880
the afternoon and all that stuff and I

590
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,960
already gave you the slides here like I

591
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,180
know where you're going at this

592
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,200
so okay all right so maker driven let's

593
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,410
let's kind of punch through a few things

594
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,030
on this alright so first we're software

595
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,910
engineers who specialize in a specific

596
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,980
discipline security that means one thing

597
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,590
that means the security must be able to

598
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,810
write code and I've said this before at

599
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,220
a conference and then I got like a lot

600
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:48,139
of hate messages on Twitter about it and

601
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,630
in the end I sort of and so if you if

602
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,170
you're hoping to to do that like that's

603
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,340
great

604
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,140
take a picture of it put it on Twitter

605
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,250
say the wicked says security must be

606
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,360
able to write code and I'll be dealing

607
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,170
with that for like months to come

608
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,080
appreciate it

609
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,690
thanks but we could really think about

610
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,149
what it really means like you're in the

611
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,490
process of delivering software you're in

612
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,630
you're you're you're you're in the world

613
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,820
of software and you don't know how to

614
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,590
actually like create software to be a

615
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,750
part of the process of writing software

616
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,399
like that should be concerning like

617
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,610
security should know how to be a part of

618
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,570
this operations had to do the same thing

619
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,250
operations used to say well I just run

620
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,780
the internet server and I don't deal

621
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,820
with any other problems or I just run

622
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,100
the you know the Tomcat or whatever but

623
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,389
all that stuff had to break down I'm not

624
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,070
saying security needs to lead the

625
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,680
process I'm not saying like Security's

626
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,510
main job is to write code but being part

627
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,330
of the software delivery process that's

628
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,980
really important and I don't know why

629
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,860
this is a hot take in our industry but

630
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,900
it seems to be and we'll see and maybe

631
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,419
in five years I'll be wrong but I think

632
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,910
that in five years I won't be if you try

633
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,410
to get a job like one of those like

634
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,240
startups or not never startups like any

635
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,530
any security job right now that's like

636
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,210
dev psych ops like they're gonna expect

637
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,970
you to write code right I mean that

638
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,170
seems pretty pretty reasonable and

639
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,269
there's a lot of resources available

640
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,830
today these are my two favor

641
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:08,539
books on writing code there were that I

642
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:14,330
don't leave these keep these on the

643
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:15,320
right on the desk so in the end like we

644
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,789
have to think about that we have to

645
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,468
internalize this as like security as

646
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,559
part of making like we're a part of the

647
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:23,809
building of the stuff and rardy we're

648
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,299
already somewhat developers operations

649
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,249
was like yeah you know I do already kind

650
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,168
of know a lot of yeah MLAT well I guess

651
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:31,999
his other stuff back then but I'm

652
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,830
dealing with all this kind of code like

653
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:35,989
stuff and security is already using

654
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,968
those those DSL zazz well like we're

655
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:42,619
dealing with like writing those laughs

656
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:43,700
regex rules by trial and error okay you

657
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,689
haven't been you haven't lived that or

658
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,099
you're like I don't wanna live that

659
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:51,019
anymore so but but the part is that the

660
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:52,609
point is is that the security team has

661
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,719
to participate in in the software

662
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:58,218
delivery process this is also an empathy

663
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:01,070
building exercise because it provides

664
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:02,690
you familiarity with the tools and be

665
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,218
able to move up and down the pipeline

666
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,450
you're able to shift left and shift

667
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:07,219
right and all that all that sort of

668
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,129
stuff but you're able to participate in

669
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:12,440
that process another thing that I'll say

670
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:14,748
is part of being being maker driven is

671
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,429
it to realize that a bug is a bug as a

672
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:18,559
bug like to internalize that and

673
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:20,989
understand that when we think about

674
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,109
security bugs they're just regular bugs

675
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:26,029
that can be exploited and I know a DJ

676
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,889
chalene has a lot of comments right now

677
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:30,440
on defect density and I'm not even to

678
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:32,089
talk about the importance of it or how

679
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,309
maybe it's a misleading metric or any of

680
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:35,299
that sort of stuff but I will think I do

681
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,950
want you to think about this all

682
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,929
computer science papers that kind of

683
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,489
talk about defect density or errors per

684
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:43,459
lines of code and all that sort of stuff

685
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:47,389
the studies range from like half to ten

686
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:49,219
per thousand line of code the important

687
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:52,689
part is that defect density is never

688
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:55,849
zero defect density is never zero and

689
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:58,279
now whenever I'm dealing with like all

690
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:59,749
my framework and my dependencies and all

691
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:02,329
the stuff that it gets bundled into my

692
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:04,039
software the 500 lines of code are a

693
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:05,989
thousand lines of code that I write can

694
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,820
easily turn into you know four hundred

695
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:09,980
thousand lines of code five hundred

696
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,730
thousand lines of code

697
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,440
okay so my hot take on all that is that

698
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,460
we just can't train developers we can't

699
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,139
just say well we're just gonna put you

700
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,149
through the annual the annual training

701
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,658
and like you're gonna be you know good

702
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:23,610
to go

703
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,080
you know how good luck with that and we

704
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,240
can't train human we can't train

705
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,460
developers to write secure code not

706
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,409
because developers are stupid or not

707
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,999
because the you know the training

708
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,279
doesn't exist or we didn't buy the right

709
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:37,740
product it's because you can't teach

710
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,659
humans to write code that doesn't have

711
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,779
errors we've been trying to for a long

712
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,190
time and there's there's no way to do it

713
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:46,139
so instead I think we should focus on

714
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,929
the ways that developers use to deliver

715
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:50,939
a code that is like less error-prone and

716
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:52,409
more resilient defaults so they do

717
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,960
test-driven development behavior driven

718
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:56,749
development they put meaningful comments

719
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,100
in their commits or in their in the code

720
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,269
they think of like code smells and

721
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,009
patterns and refactoring and

722
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:04,889
instrumentation and observability and

723
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:07,860
they work with the they work in ways

724
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:09,748
that that security could easily fit our

725
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:14,008
tooling and our processes into that

726
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:15,809
right okay so where were we left with

727
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,399
this the agile application security book

728
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,408
says the goal should be to come up with

729
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:21,449
a set of tests an automated test that

730
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:24,389
probe and check security configurations

731
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,129
and runtime system behavior for security

732
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:28,229
features that will execute every time

733
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:31,289
the system is built and every time it is

734
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,090
deployed so all right that's that's

735
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:35,309
that's how we can think about it

736
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,439
my last point on this this measure piece

737
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,299
is that security is inherently connected

738
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,450
with quality the the dev sec ops

739
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:44,850
community survey in 2019 found that one

740
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,009
in four developers believe that security

741
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,299
is synonymous with quality and we think

742
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,889
that's going to continue to grow over

743
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,658
time like that is one of those things

744
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:53,189
that people believe about their software

745
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,269
and they want to have high quality

746
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:59,730
software so being maker driven means to

747
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,350
see security as part of engineering view

748
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,629
quality as a way to bring security in

749
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:08,070
and use code and not vendors to solve

750
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:10,939
problems don't tell people in the expo

751
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,499
hall that I said that last bit okay so

752
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,659
experimenting and and how we can learn

753
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:17,100
from our experiments so what are some

754
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,929
benefits that we can have from from

755
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,439
doing experiments they can be measured

756
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,269
and repeatable there

757
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,630
we get results based on our needs we

758
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:27,639
have actual outcomes and and we can look

759
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,090
at I like Aaron's quote I work with

760
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:32,168
their and Aaron Reinhart he says this

761
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,908
security incidents are not effective

762
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:36,279
measures of detection because at that

763
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:37,539
point it's already too late so what if

764
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,950
you're able to sort of do some

765
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:41,019
experimentation and learn like what are

766
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,299
some common causes or common problems

767
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:47,620
you have Shanon Lisa and I gave this

768
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:50,168
presentation at RSA and 2019 and some

769
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,908
research that she did was taking the

770
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:54,460
Olas top ten and moving this across

771
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,679
that's the blue dots there and then

772
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,600
breaking it down into a tech attack

773
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,440
vector or attack of types of attackers

774
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,350
and it's split up there with with

775
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,090
scanners paid noise and then advanced

776
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,189
adversaries mean different colors the

777
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,990
point is that you kind of got to watch

778
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,720
the whole talk and it's a it she really

779
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,909
is able to build all that out for you

780
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,100
but what your system actually

781
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,929
experiences is different from what we

782
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,820
what we predict with the Olas top ten

783
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,639
and it's different by your vertical by

784
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,600
your company business unit so that's

785
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,549
something that's worth thinking about

786
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,750
and understanding what am I actually

787
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:34,240
being attacked with okay so and so yeah

788
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,029
so no the no the most likely attacks and

789
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,039
how to measure abuse and misuse Zane

790
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:41,529
Lackey over at signal sciences he says

791
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,759
we can't seed home-field advantage and I

792
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,110
like that because a lot of times the

793
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:45,519
security would say well you can't you

794
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,070
can't make a perfectly secure system

795
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,779
it's like well maybe not but I know my

796
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,918
system better than anybody else right at

797
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:54,009
least could way better than the

798
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,740
attackers could so why can't I actually

799
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:58,690
understand it a little more further so

800
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,139
but experimenting necessitates that we

801
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:04,210
understand our steady state so I think

802
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:06,100
there's a couple resources for you any

803
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,259
of the stuff that Shannon Leitz does her

804
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,120
Twitter handles Deb suck-ups and there's

805
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:14,019
a talk which is very similar to that

806
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:17,789
slide that I showed for 2019 RSA that's

807
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:20,950
hooked in there as well so all right a

808
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:22,090
automation all right this is the the the

809
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,559
piece that I think is pretty interesting

810
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,539
to a lot of us is what we think about

811
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,428
when we start thinking about devstack

812
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,899
ops we think about the pipeline this

813
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:30,820
also come from that from that Deb psych

814
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:32,590
ops survey but you can break it up to

815
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,600
all the phases of the pipeline and you

816
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,179
can see the

817
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,340
those without a DevOps practice there's

818
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,740
the kind of the orangie looking red

819
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,240
color on there for you and those are

820
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,310
those are much lower than people who

821
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,170
have implemented application security

822
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,550
practices which is in there like they're

823
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,710
kind of called the DevOps elite and

824
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:52,169
they're like that purpley blue color but

825
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,620
I was really just encouraged across the

826
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,790
way like all a lot of the phases of the

827
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,439
pipeline people are implementing

828
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,090
security tooling and security testing

829
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,550
now if you attended Derek's talk you

830
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,620
could see that like survey data versus

831
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:07,379
like reality and code may not be as

832
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,689
great as great as you think so you might

833
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,160
want to hit him up for some things on

834
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,090
the slides for for that for that talk

835
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,890
but I also thought it was cool like web

836
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,540
application firewalls container

837
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,580
applications security open source

838
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,200
governance static application analysis

839
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,850
dynamic application analysis these are

840
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,630
tools that we've had for most of them

841
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:29,280
for a fairly long amount of time and we

842
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,440
see that those are DevOps elite

843
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,500
practices far in a way have them

844
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,210
installed across and larger usage across

845
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,670
the organization all right so also with

846
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:45,150
automating is we can think about how how

847
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:48,150
much we deliver how how often we how

848
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:51,350
often we deliver how security plays in

849
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:53,670
inside of that just humble in his book

850
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:56,370
continuous delivery says continuous

851
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,310
delivery is how little you can deploy at

852
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:01,949
any one time I often think about this is

853
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,720
cycle time and we like to out we need to

854
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,730
optimize for for total cycle time and

855
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,350
that means from timing of code commit to

856
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,840
like running and production you want

857
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,980
that to be as small as possible a lot of

858
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,870
people will recommend like the coffee

859
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,430
tests of like if it takes longer than

860
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,870
five minutes to go from code commit to

861
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,760
running in production you might need a

862
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,000
refactor you need to include your

863
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,160
security tests in that as well

864
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,690
there's a great talk yesterday about on

865
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,670
the pipeline and how to how to do that

866
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,290
and like how you can fork out like

867
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,780
long-running jobs and things like that

868
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:34,830
but whenever I was over at signal

869
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,780
Sciences we did 15,000 deploys in three

870
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,730
and a half years and and you know a

871
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,460
fairly small team fairly small start-up

872
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,110
but we were moving quite rapidly it's

873
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,600
because we constantly were always

874
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,620
optimizing for for total cycle time we

875
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,209
would have meetings where we'd come in

876
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,649
and be like

877
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,049
right here's the build it's like six

878
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:53,629
minutes today like how can we get this

879
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:55,250
to go faster and so everybody would have

880
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,779
to like you know count off for like what

881
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,190
they're doing and and we would look at

882
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,080
the security tests along with everything

883
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,299
else and it wasn't the answer to drop

884
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,889
them it was like maybe run them in a

885
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,710
different cadence run them in a

886
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,480
non-blocking mode maybe move them to the

887
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,760
deployment system which we did did as

888
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,279
well but putting security in the

889
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,799
pipeline you know you can you can start

890
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,330
kind of small right you can do I mean I

891
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,740
guess SCA is not that small but you can

892
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,750
put language linters you can do some

893
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,580
like get hound stuff putting some

894
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,500
scanners in there using gauntlet putting

895
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,240
monitoring and telemetry in there those

896
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,230
are some ideas for you there's there's

897
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,760
been a lot of great talks at this

898
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,980
conference already about how to do a lot

899
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,679
of that stuff but we're now we're able

900
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,000
to treat deploys as standard routine

901
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,440
changes that have been pre-approved by

902
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
management and they don't require this

903
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,710
heavyweight change approval board or

904
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,539
anything like that so that's really

905
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,220
refreshing and that means like security

906
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:45,440
can now like unlock that whole like

907
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,330
going fast part right maybe we're not

908
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,559
maybe we may or may not be like stopping

909
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,439
all the breaches but at least we can

910
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,510
unblock the business and hopefully we

911
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,029
will like bring down some of the some of

912
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,279
the breaches as well so I have two

913
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:59,929
courses that I've written on this topic

914
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,549
one is def sac ops building is secure

915
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,380
continuous delivery pipeline over on

916
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:04,970
LinkedIn learning and the other one is

917
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,860
an automated security testing which is

918
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,389
more of a deep dive into the the actual

919
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,190
code side but if you're interested in

920
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,179
those go check it out or hit me up I

921
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,089
might be able to get you like free

922
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:18,200
access to it all right all right the

923
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:19,369
next one here asks safety aware do we

924
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,408
understand like the difference between

925
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:23,149
simple and complex systems a lot of

926
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,010
times we are our human brains will often

927
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,960
try to take a complex system and we try

928
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:29,389
to make it they could make it a simple

929
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,879
system but when we say simple we mean

930
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:34,220
they're linear in nature they're they're

931
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,348
easy to predict and and something that

932
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,750
we're able to accomplish and in our head

933
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,580
like it's something we're able to keep

934
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:45,440
our mental you know model if you will

935
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:48,290
and understand but complex systems they

936
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,730
are nonlinear in nature they suffer from

937
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,099
what's what can be called like the

938
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:54,889
bullwhip effect so a small change at one

939
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:57,470
end of the whip creates you know

940
00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:00,200
sound sound breaking sound barrier

941
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,689
breaking at the other end right so so

942
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,578
complete

943
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:05,579
different results can happen out of the

944
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:08,970
system they're unpredictable in nature

945
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:12,540
and there's no mental model available

946
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,490
form so with all this like we we like to

947
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,560
abstract complexity away and this is

948
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,029
something we do you know in code and

949
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,490
frameworks and other things like that

950
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,930
but we do it with we try to you know

951
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,129
think of human beings like we have

952
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,660
another mental model or the way we deal

953
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,560
with other people we do there's a

954
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,640
society psychological issues we do it

955
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,750
because we can't handle all the

956
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,490
cognitive load of keeping it all

957
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,589
straight in our head at any one time and

958
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,390
so and we deal with that same problem

959
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,920
through software and we just add another

960
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,020
layer of abstraction right like that's

961
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,430
always the the quickest way to solve a

962
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,759
problem it's like I bet some yeah mold

963
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:49,098
might fix that I thought that would be

964
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,099
funnier so good we're two for two great

965
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:55,740
who do you maybe haven't been burned

966
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:57,210
enough by yeah mo I don't know but so as

967
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,560
we think about complex systems then we

968
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,510
now have to think if we don't actually

969
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,759
understand the system in any sort of

970
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,500
real way why is it do we think that we

971
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,930
can arrive at a root cause in a failure

972
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,660
type mode and so I think root cause

973
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,540
specifically in a complex system as a

974
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,730
myth because we lack the full picture

975
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,589
complex systems aren't linear this is

976
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,970
part of our blame culture that we that

977
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:19,619
we live in you can think about our

978
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,270
example with with William crash right

979
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,790
it's like and you're fired it's like

980
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,740
well you know at first blush like that

981
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,720
seemed like a good idea but later it's

982
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,390
like well I mean you know all the steps

983
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,819
were taken you know who maybe somebody

984
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,460
else should have been fired right it

985
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:37,380
also lacks the context and forgets the

986
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,190
organizational decisions around the the

987
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:44,430
whole the whole event as it happens it

988
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,750
really puts a focus on the specific you

989
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,279
know the two trainings crashing into

990
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,260
each other the explosion rather than the

991
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,490
the whole situation and kind of lead-up

992
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,690
to the whole event and how it all

993
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:57,118
unfolded together right and Sidney

994
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,740
Dekker has a great book called drift

995
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,569
into failure and he has this quote he

996
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,569
says drifting into failure is a gradual

997
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:05,640
incremental decline into disaster driven

998
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:07,410
by environmental pressure unruly

999
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,960
technology and social processes that

1000
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:13,490
normalize growing risk no organization

1001
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,490
is exempt from drifting into failure

1002
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,690
we can think about the Boeing 737 max we

1003
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,170
can think about how like you know now

1004
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:24,660
we're we have this the MCAS it's it

1005
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,340
commands the trim so the pilots don't

1006
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,490
have to worry about it for like a larger

1007
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,470
airplane the thing is the mcs is just

1008
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,390
software like the software was doing all

1009
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,859
this without the pilots like really

1010
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,480
being able to detect what was doing what

1011
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,590
was going on and they were being told

1012
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,100
you know like the software was fighting

1013
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,900
the pilots like silently and the pilots

1014
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,880
were having to deal with this all this

1015
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,020
information in the context where they

1016
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,900
were told that everything is like a

1017
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:56,340
normal you know Boeing 737 and it was

1018
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,960
and it I don't know if you've ever

1019
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,290
researched this or seen any of these the

1020
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,550
info on this but the crashes were

1021
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,320
happening they're like I don't know

1022
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:06,360
three to five minutes before after the

1023
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,800
planes takeoff something like that so

1024
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,640
you were putting your these your

1025
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,790
operators in a high-speed

1026
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,379
decision-making environment in a very an

1027
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,000
up-tempo environment where they have to

1028
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,410
figure out what's going on and all of

1029
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,590
the software is telling them that

1030
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,009
everything is fine and software is

1031
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:25,110
eating the world and taking over our

1032
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,880
systems so we're you know our physical

1033
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:28,950
systems as well so now we're living in

1034
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,810
this complex environment where we're

1035
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,549
dealing with this and Sidney Decker's

1036
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,110
quote goes on to sir he goes on to say

1037
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,120
something else about complexity says the

1038
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,950
growth of complexity in society has

1039
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,850
gotten ahead of our understanding of how

1040
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:44,490
complex systems work and how they fail

1041
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:46,620
so it's kind of concerning but I was

1042
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,649
like I don't know maybe oh here I'll

1043
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,690
pull down a service app and I was like

1044
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,940
oh that's that's cool I can understand

1045
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:56,100
that I get it like where's my three-tier

1046
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,990
web app right it's like like that at

1047
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,060
least I could like put that in my brain

1048
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,799
and figure out like yeah the blinky

1049
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,750
lights on the database are not good like

1050
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,700
it's like things aren't working in your

1051
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,290
web app you're like I have no idea and

1052
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,419
this was whenever I went and downloaded

1053
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,980
this is like an easy you know getting

1054
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,850
started guide of like you know how to

1055
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,260
use lambda and stuff it's like okay cool

1056
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,670
how like my friend Matt Stein says he's

1057
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,330
like it's becoming clear to me now

1058
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:23,430
software probably a mistake

1059
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,480
I don't know exactly what he was talking

1060
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,770
about but I like to think he's talking

1061
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,470
about this so we're leaving the

1062
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,540
operations and the security team we're

1063
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,220
putting all this burden on them to

1064
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,790
rationalize our system models and to

1065
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:41,700
keep all this in their heads so that is

1066
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:44,279
not good and and we have to think about

1067
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,140
our failures as a system problem because

1068
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,350
we don't have enough safety margin and

1069
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,870
that's a quote from agent Cockroft and

1070
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,940
and we have to also reckon with this

1071
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:56,490
with this fact that now we're dealing

1072
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,740
with with systems or complex there they

1073
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:00,479
can they they fail it's just a part of

1074
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,879
their nature and Sidney Decker says

1075
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,250
failure is an inevitable byproduct of a

1076
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,370
complex systems normal functioning like

1077
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:10,200
it's an inescapable thing so how does

1078
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,430
security fit in all this well security

1079
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,589
can be part of the story of adding

1080
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:15,960
safety margin in we can add telemetry

1081
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,970
and instrumentation in we can

1082
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,650
participate in blameless retros of

1083
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,810
endless retrospectives or post mortems

1084
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,220
or however you think about that but

1085
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,830
specifically on the blameless side of

1086
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,419
things and and I have some more stuff in

1087
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,720
the impetus section to talk about that

1088
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,100
later

1089
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,330
but if you're interested in any of this

1090
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,890
I think you're kind of peaked I like

1091
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,690
okay the safety stuff like sounds oddly

1092
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,850
familiar and oddly scary to the stuff

1093
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,440
that I deal with in security here's some

1094
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,930
here's some links for you I guess the

1095
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,880
the text there maybe be hard to read but

1096
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,830
check these out there is a human error

1097
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,110
video series that Aaron Reinhart turned

1098
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:49,110
me on to by Sidney Decker that I think

1099
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,700
is like really great and then if you

1100
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,770
don't have any if you only have time to

1101
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,240
do one thing or read one thing at the

1102
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,310
very bottom there's Richard cooks paper

1103
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,319
it's a called how complex systems fail

1104
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:01,820
it's pretty short Richard cook is a

1105
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:04,170
medical doctor and he he wrote this this

1106
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,060
this thing about how complex systems the

1107
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,830
human body failed but when you read it

1108
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,980
as an IT person you're like holy smokes

1109
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,480
like that sounds exactly like the stuff

1110
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,320
that I deal with on a day-to-day basis

1111
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,910
and now Richard cook goes around

1112
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,950
speaking on this and he'll speak at a

1113
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,990
lot of IT conferences nowadays because

1114
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,549
of kind of so much overlap and so much

1115
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,680
of so much learning that we've gotten

1116
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,360
out of that ok well let's move along so

1117
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,850
let's talk about unrestrained sharing

1118
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,820
unrestrained sharing is is something

1119
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,650
that may feel a little weird to security

1120
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,390
but

1121
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,790
Patrick Dubois when he first founded

1122
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,670
DevOps and he first kicked it off I

1123
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:43,160
think is like 2011 or 2012 he did a

1124
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,710
enterprise can can DevOps work in the

1125
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:50,029
enterprise and he did a whole I think

1126
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,410
was a cutter IT Journal on this but one

1127
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,910
of his quotes is that culture is the

1128
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,190
most important aspect to DevOps

1129
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,629
succeeding in the enterprise and if you

1130
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,000
go back in time and you were like to ask

1131
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:03,350
anybody in DevOps like what is DevOps

1132
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,060
especially in like 2010 or 2011 they

1133
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,040
would just say it is a cultural movement

1134
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,140
you know stop right and then you're like

1135
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,910
well that's that's not going to do it

1136
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,100
but they were so worried about like

1137
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,600
people taking DevOps and then equating

1138
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,509
that with some sort of software or

1139
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,009
tooling or job title or something like

1140
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,570
that eventually we did all those things

1141
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,460
because we're humans and that's what we

1142
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,680
do and they they you know all of the

1143
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,110
original DevOps OGIS were like that's

1144
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,970
that's gonna happen so we we don't want

1145
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,520
to do that but it's it's gone hadn't

1146
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,560
happened anyways but I do still believe

1147
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,110
that we originally focused on culture

1148
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,640
for the right reason and we still need

1149
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:40,220
to continue to keep that as a heartbeat

1150
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,230
for for DevOps and because Deb psych ops

1151
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,879
is just an extension of DevOps we need

1152
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:48,530
to think about that as we kind of move

1153
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,880
forward rich Smith he says if former

1154
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,380
security director over etsy says the

1155
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,690
security team who embraces openness

1156
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,600
about what it does and why spreads

1157
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,990
understanding so unrestrained cold

1158
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,770
unrestrained sharing affects our culture

1159
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,569
but it goes against a lot of our

1160
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,910
standard operation operating procedures

1161
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,860
a lot of times I think that you'll feel

1162
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,529
that it'll feel uncomfortable to you to

1163
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:12,050
share but sharing naturally breaks down

1164
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,400
silos you know if you like if you it's

1165
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,990
like oh only the security team is

1166
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,670
allowed to log in to this one security

1167
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,959
tool like developers should never have

1168
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,180
you know information about this because

1169
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,120
you know cloak-and-dagger type stuff

1170
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,859
well like that's probably wrong if you

1171
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,259
have thinking like that you need to try

1172
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,580
to come up with ways to maybe sanitize

1173
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,170
some of the data or whatever but you

1174
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,990
gotta figure out ways to create sharing

1175
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,400
across those groups for keys that I

1176
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,350
think are important for culture are

1177
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,090
having a mutual understanding having

1178
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,790
shared language having shared views

1179
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,470
putting collaborative tooling in place

1180
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:45,170
and and as those things kind of develop

1181
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,290
you start building culture that is

1182
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,450
really useful

1183
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,820
I like the Deaf's a cop survey because

1184
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,680
one of the questions that they're asking

1185
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,020
developers like hey what do you think

1186
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,220
about just you know security or and then

1187
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,410
they were trying to going back and forth

1188
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,240
on this but one of the answers was you

1189
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,279
know we don't even really know what like

1190
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,439
security wants from us like we have no

1191
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,520
idea what they want us to do and and it

1192
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,680
didn't matter if they were a DevOps

1193
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,570
practice or immature and their DevOps

1194
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,370
practice they were just like yeah flat

1195
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,230
out like a fifth of them are just like

1196
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:16,980
confused like we security has not

1197
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,270
brought them in in the process so I

1198
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,370
think security shares through making

1199
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,530
stuff the invisible stuff visible adding

1200
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,779
security observability finding ways to

1201
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,890
put in api's or web hooks or dev tooling

1202
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,750
or any of that sort of stuff and you

1203
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,640
can't leave out the auditors which is I

1204
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,700
know it's really tempting to do sorry if

1205
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,319
there's any auditors in the room but I

1206
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,299
think it's important there's a project

1207
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,010
that we started working on I guess about

1208
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,480
a year and a half two years ago called

1209
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,550
dear auditor and it's over at dear

1210
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,330
auditor org and this is a love letter

1211
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:49,860
from dev ops to auditors and in it we we

1212
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:51,900
we apologize which sometimes you have to

1213
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,340
do and we said hey we started this whole

1214
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,740
DevOps thing and we didn't bring the

1215
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,970
auditors around because I don't anybody

1216
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,189
go through like an audit our compliance

1217
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,529
thing you're like you start talking and

1218
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,720
the auditors like mmm I that is not

1219
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:07,800
gonna work you know and you're like we

1220
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,569
have a huge disconnect here so so I've

1221
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,130
experienced that and so we built this

1222
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:15,240
and then also associated with this is a

1223
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:17,040
DevOps controls matric matrix so if you

1224
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,479
want it's open source check it out we're

1225
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,430
still working on it so putting some

1226
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,040
stuff stuff together on this but yeah

1227
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,509
okay so some resources for under strange

1228
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,800
sharing I think the Phoenix project book

1229
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,770
if you haven't read it I know it's kind

1230
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,750
of canon now but definitely check that

1231
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,730
out that book the agile applications

1232
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,190
security book has some as some context

1233
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,620
on on this as well and then dear auditor

1234
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,210
I think is a great resource or I think

1235
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,210
it could be a great resource if we can

1236
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,980
kind of get more work behind it

1237
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:47,540
okay let's talk organization what do we

1238
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,540
mean about ruggedized ation

1239
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:59,270
it is it is it is running everywhere

1240
00:45:52,750 --> 00:46:01,579
yeah so I think one thing like the one

1241
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:03,740
way we build is something that's rugged

1242
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:05,569
is by like knowing what we have which is

1243
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,640
kind of a novel concept right so like we

1244
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:09,109
have our build materials and so we we

1245
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,650
get to know what is inside of our

1246
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:14,598
software another thing that you can

1247
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,910
think about for rugged or rugged ization

1248
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:19,579
of software is that you know we favor

1249
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,920
short-lived systems the old saying of

1250
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,819
cattle not pets although I've heard some

1251
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,109
people tell me they don't they don't

1252
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:25,700
appreciate that and there's some other

1253
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:29,270
ways we can think about it but I'm like

1254
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,250
I don't know but Sunil you he has the

1255
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:32,839
the Daiya framework and he is working on

1256
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,809
a paper and I'm not sure if it's out yet

1257
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:37,460
or not but he's he's it's a it's proving

1258
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:40,309
that just by having these three

1259
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,200
attributes in your system your your by

1260
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:44,869
by the very nature mathematically more

1261
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,759
secure so if it's distributed immutable

1262
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:49,700
in ephemeral if you have those three

1263
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,250
things in in any combination you are

1264
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:54,200
you're going to be more secure so it's a

1265
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,390
pretty cool pretty cool research and

1266
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,618
really interesting so as that comes out

1267
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,029
or kind of be looking for it as you can

1268
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:01,160
find it

1269
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:03,230
but where is recognization going like we

1270
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,520
can we can talk about other other types

1271
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,650
of stuff but I think there's two key

1272
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,609
areas where I believe ruggedized ation

1273
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,099
is happening and where we're going to

1274
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:12,650
see this grow over the next year first I

1275
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:13,940
think deception this is you know this we

1276
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,559
I know we have like all the honey pots

1277
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,140
and all that stuff like 10 years ago and

1278
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:20,299
but I see people really like industry

1279
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,950
leading firms that are that are working

1280
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:24,349
on doing deception tactics that are

1281
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,180
making a huge difference they're putting

1282
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:28,099
honey pits and tar pits and man traps

1283
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,629
and all sorts of stuff it's simple to

1284
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:33,140
get started you can like just you know

1285
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:34,819
puts you know spoof out some you know

1286
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,470
some hidden htpb fields or something

1287
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:39,230
like that and see if those get called

1288
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:40,839
and you can flag it some good projects

1289
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,039
on this honey pie is an open source one

1290
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:44,210
deception logic is friend of Mines

1291
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:46,789
companies trying to get off the ground

1292
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,260
so it's kind of cool but but thinking

1293
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:50,029
through like how do we build better

1294
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,200
deception into our systems as ways we

1295
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:53,390
can get security telemetry and

1296
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,149
instrumentation out and to the

1297
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:58,460
developers and we can sort of play that

1298
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:00,349
out so the other piece I think is also

1299
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,490
chaos engineering which is someone where

1300
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:02,520
we've kind of started with this whole

1301
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,080
talk and

1302
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,030
we've talked about where that sort of

1303
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,540
fits in but we're moving from this

1304
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:11,280
disaster recovery belief system to now

1305
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,110
we're moving into chaos engineering and

1306
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,210
then overall like we're trying to build

1307
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:17,340
overall resiliency and Adrian Cockroft

1308
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,350
has a great quote on that Michael

1309
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,090
Nygaard so if you need a primer to chaos

1310
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,620
engineering and you're like you can't

1311
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:25,110
wait until the the new O'Reilly book

1312
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,880
comes out in a few months there's a

1313
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,110
there's a great book called release it

1314
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,280
but you have to get the second edition

1315
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,330
if you want to if you want to check it

1316
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,370
out because the out of the chaos

1317
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:34,920
engineering in the second edition but

1318
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:37,200
it's by Michael Nygaard he has this

1319
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,150
quote he says chaos engineering is

1320
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,770
empirical rather than formal we don't

1321
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,840
use models to understand what the system

1322
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:48,030
should do we run experiments and then we

1323
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:49,980
learn what it does Erin Reinhardt my

1324
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,110
buddy says the security discipline of

1325
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,640
chaos experimentation is done in order

1326
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,230
to build confidence in the system's

1327
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,529
ability to defend against malicious

1328
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,730
conditions and so that's what that's

1329
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,980
what chaos engineering is trying to do

1330
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,530
we're trying to experiment we're trying

1331
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,990
to run run these experiments that span

1332
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:08,220
both engineering and security a lot of

1333
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,040
places will put it into a commando

1334
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,419
opt-out type scenario but you make

1335
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,560
valuable learning and like it's all

1336
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,210
about the learning you're not trying to

1337
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,500
just blow stuff up and break stuff in

1338
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,820
production which you know some of the

1339
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,830
marketing material will come out on that

1340
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:22,380
but what we're really trying to do is

1341
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:24,960
figure out our system operates like this

1342
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:27,090
today and we get a more clear picture of

1343
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,500
that and we build these experiments that

1344
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,510
are controlled they have a controlled

1345
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,500
blast radius and it helps prove out like

1346
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,730
if our mental model and our

1347
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,960
understanding of the system is true

1348
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,880
today and then like whenever that

1349
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,570
experiments gets run again later is it

1350
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,670
still true here's some resources on this

1351
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,290
there's a Erin stock at RSA there's the

1352
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,080
principles of chaos there's the release

1353
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:47,700
it book and then Phillip Maddux and herb

1354
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,470
Todd both have great talks on deception

1355
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,930
so feel free to check those out if you

1356
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:54,209
can it's like you're like I didn't know

1357
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:56,879
I was gonna get all this homework so but

1358
00:49:54,210 --> 00:50:00,000
you know I find that as good oh let's go

1359
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,010
back to the wall here all right so when

1360
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,400
I think of all the arguments this is oh

1361
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:08,430
and I have had I realize how silly most

1362
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,170
of them were and it makes me wonder why

1363
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:14,390
he wanted to argue over such stupid

1364
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:14,390
things I think I'll go ask him

1365
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:21,640
this is a problem in our industry oh did

1366
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,950
you want to picture that you could okay

1367
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,529
this is problem in our industry we're

1368
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:30,618
we're kind of like always at war and and

1369
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:33,650
against each other and who's ever had

1370
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:35,090
this situation where maybe not you cuz

1371
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,580
you're you know right ma you're a tenth

1372
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:39,859
you're at global OPSEC DC so you're

1373
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,650
right minded individual but who says oh

1374
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:45,590
those stupid developers anybody our

1375
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,270
friend that ever says that yeah it's

1376
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,430
okay

1377
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:51,440
nobody wants to admit it it's okay if

1378
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,430
you've said it too it happens right but

1379
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,990
sometimes we'll say like those stupid

1380
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,569
developers just in a real cavalier type

1381
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:58,009
manner and then I've had developers tell

1382
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,960
me they're like oh you security people

1383
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,880
you just want us to power off the

1384
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,580
machine and unplug them and just like

1385
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,109
you know like and I'm like wow so you

1386
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,759
think that I don't understand where my

1387
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:09,049
paychecks come from because I know if we

1388
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,060
did that long enough like we would never

1389
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,310
know you know the business you know ends

1390
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,529
right but the but developers see

1391
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,420
security is so disconnected from the

1392
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,710
running of the business they're like the

1393
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,170
only way they're going to be happy is if

1394
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:24,490
just you know you have you know a

1395
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:27,619
complete you know nihilism here right so

1396
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:29,959
well half the developers say that they

1397
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:32,000
don't have time to spend on security and

1398
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,060
and that's something that they deal with

1399
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,100
the we've looked at this from 2017 2018

1400
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,960
2019 the deficit cops report is always

1401
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,270
reporting like 50 percent or 48 percent

1402
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,070
they're in the background but developers

1403
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,810
want to do security they just you know

1404
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,280
find that they often don't have time and

1405
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:49,520
so one of the ways that as a security

1406
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,810
person we can be helpful especially in

1407
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,430
the apps tech world is like hey let's

1408
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,500
not be blockers but let's be enablers

1409
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,850
let's help you know kind of do all these

1410
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,250
other things in the measure of framework

1411
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:59,750
to help us make that happen okay well

1412
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,640
I'm gonna kind of wind down here this is

1413
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,619
the the measure framework again and

1414
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,060
we've kind of gone through that and if

1415
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:06,530
you have any so one of the things we're

1416
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,330
doing is we're collecting stories about

1417
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,810
devstack ops movements or

1418
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:12,380
transformations or failures at

1419
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:15,529
organizations and we're working on a

1420
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,840
book for the same publisher as the dev

1421
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,970
ops handbook over with Jean Kim but you

1422
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,100
can share your story with us book at dev

1423
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,299
suck-ups org and we'd be happy to

1424
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,069
interview you kind of write up a case

1425
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,100
study if you need us to do it

1426
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,750
anonymously I guess we could

1427
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,430
but we learned like I said it doesn't

1428
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,750
have to be a pure success it could be

1429
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,100
like yeah we tried it and liked it

1430
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,590
didn't work like that's still really

1431
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,940
really valid information for us so if

1432
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,230
you have any if you want to get the

1433
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,420
slides you can send me an email it at

1434
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,730
wicked America IO or if you have any

1435
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:46,990
questions you can hit him eeeh - a

1436
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:47,860
wicked but no we're kind of toward the

1437
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,240
end of the conference and we have a

1438
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,940
little bit break and I asked Shawn about

1439
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,700
this earlier with the I know like Matt

1440
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,560
tessaro's here Aaron reinhardt's here DJ

1441
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,850
slean's here so we thought maybe we

1442
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,920
could have a dev SEC op support group

1443
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:05,080
down here at the front so if you have

1444
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,540
any like questions or you need anything

1445
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,279
like you asked me ask these these guys

1446
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,259
they've done it alike you know large

1447
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,120
large enterprises they've they've put

1448
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,310
together pipelines at different places

1449
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,150
so we'd be happy to come talk about it

1450
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,490
we're gonna be hanging around by the

1451
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,660
front for a little bit but but I

1452
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,750
appreciate your time and thanks and hope

1453
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:26,690
you enjoy the rest of the conference

1454
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:26,690
[Applause]
