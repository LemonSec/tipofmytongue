1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,779
well good morning everyone and thanks

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,010
very much for for coming to this talk

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:12,129
even though it's kind of early in the

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,750
morning my name is Niels earring and I'm

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,299
gonna try to give you a talk today on

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:20,529
applying security engineering principles

7
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:22,720
to complex composite systems I know that

8
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:25,480
sounds like a dry and boring government

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,899
title and and it is but I'm gonna try to

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,059
try to liven it up a bit with a few

11
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:36,429
anecdotes ah okay now I have more time

12
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:38,410
that's great okay so here's my little

13
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:40,870
obligatory outline that the size of the

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:45,968
font is how much time I'm gonna spend on

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:51,309
each section okay so the purpose of this

16
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:53,410
talk and is it's a keynote right so I

17
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:55,989
kind of had to keep it high level is to

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,559
talk about security when you need to

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:01,839
apply it to big complex systems you know

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,590
and many of us in our career will write

21
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:08,048
you know small I need it fast simple

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,049
systems and will write big complicated

23
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:13,930
multi-part systems right we all do that

24
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:17,170
and this is really focusing on that that

25
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,939
far end of the spectrum where you have a

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,439
very large system with lots of parts

27
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:22,719
that are heterogeneous and we're not on

28
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,548
different platforms and they all have to

29
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,259
work together and it ultimately has to

30
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:32,200
be secure okay use of simple security

31
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:35,829
techniques you know that that we learn

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,750
in in school or when you go to a website

33
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,869
and it says hey validate your form

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,170
inputs those simple rules are very

35
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,369
important and useful but that I contend

36
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,590
that they are not sufficient by

37
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:51,820
themselves to make a large complex

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,380
composite system secure now in addition

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,240
to the systems that we build getting

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,449
getting more complex right they need to

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,119
operate in more complex environments if

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,679
you think back to say I don't know 10

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
years ago the system's already pretty

44
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:06,520
darn complex then but at least most of

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,000
them were running on your own premise

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,829
and and nowadays that's almost never the

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,180
case not even in government and

48
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,989
certainly not in private sector and

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,540
secondly

50
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,549
to establish security for a large

51
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,439
complex system is hard enough but then

52
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,719
you have to maintain its security over

53
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,430
time and that's where these security

54
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,510
engineering principles can really come

55
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,670
in handy because you can ask yourself as

56
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,310
you're doing a changes to your system or

57
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,179
adding new functionality did that

58
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:44,889
principle that I chose for my system

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,269
does that still apply ok ok so who am i

60
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,120
right

61
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:52,060
then gave you my title I've been at NSA

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,639
for 31 years all but a few months of

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,480
that in cybersecurity in one form or

64
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,379
another I've worked on the security for

65
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,108
many large NSA mission systems and

66
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:07,659
composite system designs and later in my

67
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,250
career as on various boards that look at

68
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:12,638
the design of such systems and approve

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,040
them and things like that I've had the

70
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,829
privilege at speaking at a wasp events

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,948
twice in the past once here in DC and

72
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,720
once out in Denver and you know when I

73
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,280
got this invite I was very excited

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,379
because I have a great deal of respect

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,840
for a wasp and and the work that they do

76
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:33,548
for the community you know involved in a

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,870
number of Software Assurance software

78
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,000
security activities within the

79
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,609
Department of Defense and when we're

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,609
thinking about like source material wasp

81
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:46,239
is is always a reliable place to get

82
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,739
that and just you know I had as if I was

83
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,680
wearing a hat my hat would be off to O

84
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,769
us for what they do for our for the

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,989
security community ok I'll add to my

86
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,359
background that you know try to make

87
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,120
things a little bit fun here I've been

88
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:04,989
working on on web security sort of on

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:10,269
and off with other security since the

90
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:11,799
first release of the mosaic browser now

91
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,859
those who really know web history

92
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:19,449
remember the the mosaic browser you know

93
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:23,530
written with the motif toolkit on X

94
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:26,080
Windows in mid 90s or something I was

95
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,789
you know very basic and and rudimentary

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
by today's standards although it had a

97
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,860
bunch of features that chrome still

98
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,628
doesn't have but

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,889
never but you know even back then we

100
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:37,569
were looking at this new thing called

101
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,550
the web and saying is this gonna take

102
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:43,810
offers everybody gonna stick with with

103
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,669
gopher and FTP and we realized right

104
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,639
away that security was going to be an

105
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,680
issue and me and my colleagues being at

106
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,729
NSA the first thing we thought of was

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,590
well why isn't this encrypted so the

108
00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:01,240
first web security project I ever worked

109
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:03,878
on was an attempt to encrypt HTTP

110
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,710
sessions and we you know hacked up a

111
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,210
server and we hacked up the browser and

112
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,180
of course it was NSA so we had to use

113
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,349
hardware for the encryption and all that

114
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,199
kind of it was a lot of fun and that was

115
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,870
well before SSL was invented and we

116
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,580
later you know showed people what we had

117
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,879
done then like thank God we didn't do it

118
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,710
that way because we tried to put that

119
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,020
layer of the encryption on top of HTTP

120
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,870
which is like a huge mistake putting it

121
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,930
underneath as SSL and TLS to is

122
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,599
definitely the way to go and I'll try to

123
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:44,919
tell some more anecdotes as as we go

124
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:48,699
along okay composite systems why are

125
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,349
today's systems hard to secure there's a

126
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,150
whole bunch of reasons right and and if

127
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,250
you work in these systems which you know

128
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,770
most people at an event like this would

129
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,479
you know why this is right a number of

130
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,750
university of software components is

131
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,610
just sort of through the roof long gone

132
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,710
are the days when you write like your

133
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,870
entire big complicated system in one

134
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:13,210
language on one platform using one tool

135
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:15,310
kit that's I talked to students when I

136
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,310
go recruiting and their class projects

137
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,740
are like that but you know projects out

138
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,449
in the real world certainly the ones I'm

139
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,849
familiar with it then government are not

140
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,009
like that anymore the diversity of the

141
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:28,839
internal interfaces your external

142
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,370
interface might be very homogeneous you

143
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,680
know it might be at just okay I'm gonna

144
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,719
present a web service and I'm gonna keep

145
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,150
it clean facing outward but your

146
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,729
internal interfaces tend to be very

147
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,159
complicated right and they're of diverse

148
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,870
types right you might have some that are

149
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:46,000
like restful services you might

150
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,410
have some that are message brokers you

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,140
might have some that are basically a

152
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:54,670
bunch of components talking to an SQL or

153
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:58,960
column store database we might have you

154
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:02,920
know some kooky built-in house file

155
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,799
passing service we have one at NSA and

156
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,600
and we open sourced it's all you can

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,340
enjoy it too

158
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,090
it's called Niagra files get it from

159
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,799
apache some friends of mine worked on it

160
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,440
so you know you have all these diverse

161
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,570
internal interfaces which raises the

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,969
complexity of your code because you have

163
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,710
to deal with them okay there's the

164
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,100
diversity of components and frameworks

165
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,870
and platforms and management tools my

166
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,880
dog woke me up early this morning and I

167
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,400
couldn't get back to sleep so it's just

168
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,940
like browsing you know technical

169
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,530
articles and crap and I read one about

170
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,710
cascading failure in a kubernetes system

171
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,150
were all the different agents that these

172
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,799
particular folks had layered on their

173
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,830
system like sucked up all the resources

174
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,690
and caused this cascading failure and

175
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,490
Wow why do they need all those agents

176
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,820
but every one of them they had a reason

177
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,460
why it had to be there right so with a

178
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,610
variety of types of entities that depend

179
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:04,630
on your system right to deliver them

180
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:08,500
trustworthy data or or to provide them a

181
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,780
service external providers right obvious

182
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,510
and lastly the variety of security

183
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,570
controls that you might impose on your

184
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:19,690
system or that regulators or compliance

185
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:23,440
regimes might require to be imposed on

186
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:27,210
your system in in NSA right we're an

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,710
intelligence agency we have tremendous

188
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,470
tremendously complex compliance regimes

189
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,079
that we have to comply with and all our

190
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,230
systems have to implement those okay

191
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,420
well not all of them but most of them

192
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,250
the ones that like you know serve up the

193
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:48,099
cafeteria menus and stuff for a little

194
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:52,810
less but so that variation can drive

195
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,610
complexity as well and I think a moment

196
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,760
about sort of modern development

197
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,240
environments

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,620
the other day I was just trying to some

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,200
you know hobbyist stuff at home was

200
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,130
trying to learn to use a serverless

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,080
compute on a cloud framework and I said

202
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,230
hey you know I'll just fire up eclipse

203
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,130
and and try to write some code follow a

204
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,920
tutorial and you know just downloading

205
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,540
the dependencies took multiple minutes

206
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,829
and I wasn't even on a Wi-Fi I had

207
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,270
actually plugged in the ethernet cable

208
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:28,340
so you know I had no idea what was going

209
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,300
into this thing you know it's kind of

210
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,430
like you know whatever maven central

211
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,729
thinks is good that's what's going in

212
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,530
there that's fine for a hobbyist project

213
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,000
telling a government auditor yeah I just

214
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,189
put whatever software in maven central

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,450
thought was appropriate maybe not a

216
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:47,270
sufficient answer okay so that the

217
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,830
proliferation that we see in sort of

218
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:53,000
modern software development environments

219
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:55,070
while it's great for productivity can

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,510
can complicate the security picture and

221
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,900
we'll talk more about that just a little

222
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:02,420
bit later trust relationship is another

223
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:06,110
aspect when I look at how modern

224
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,270
adversaries are attacking modern systems

225
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,150
they're often exploiting trust

226
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:16,610
relationships and we'll hit that in the

227
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:20,270
principles as well yeah and of course

228
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:23,630
this is my favorite part each year

229
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:26,870
trusted parties that you trust they

230
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,430
trust other folks right so you have this

231
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:33,620
kind of whole transitive thing going on

232
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:36,380
that you know can expose your system to

233
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,730
a risk that you didn't think you had all

234
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,220
right and we've seen that in a number of

235
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:46,190
high-profile breaches okay

236
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,690
another aspect you know I probably went

237
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,260
on too long with this whole complexity

238
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,690
thing I apologize is the types of sort

239
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,390
of entities that use your system all

240
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,180
right if we think back to the old old

241
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,890
old days you had one kind of user it was

242
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,900
a human being coming to your system with

243
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,170
a browser and you like to serve them

244
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,180
content nowadays you have still have

245
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,910
those right human users they're coming

246
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,920
from variety of browsers

247
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,589
but you also have mobile apps that are

248
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,930
trying to hit your ear system you have

249
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,070
non-people devices that you may have to

250
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,130
deal with like Internet of Things

251
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,150
devices that are calling your services

252
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,640
and they have different needs and the

253
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,709
human beings and then you have other web

254
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,630
systems within your company or within

255
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,460
your government agency or with your

256
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,250
partners that are attempting to your

257
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,990
call your system to get some service

258
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,840
okay I talked about policy and

259
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,990
regulatory complexity right that took

260
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:48,200
kind of a big jump with the European GDP

261
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:50,790
are and being introduced a year to go

262
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,270
they're higher expectations of scale and

263
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,390
resiliency today right everybody expects

264
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,980
your system be up all the time

265
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,900
now many enterprises choose to go to a

266
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,050
cloud provider to get that scale and

267
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,720
that's fine but that introduces its own

268
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:10,020
complexities because now you have to

269
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,330
configure your security sort of not

270
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,000
necessarily with your on-prem tools but

271
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,400
whatever policy and control tools the

272
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,590
cloud provider happens to offer and

273
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,560
those may not be the same from provider

274
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:26,850
to provider okay and then lastly there's

275
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,650
your whole build chain whatever a form

276
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,980
of continuous development or continuous

277
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,600
integration you might be doing those

278
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,700
systems nowadays tend to be very closely

279
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,430
connected to your production systems and

280
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,520
do they represent a path or by an

281
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:45,410
attacker can get in to your system okay

282
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,420
so in the principles that are coming up

283
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,120
we're going to use this example and I'm

284
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,640
gonna refer back to it I wanted to put

285
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,800
the actual us signals intelligence

286
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:00,090
system on in here but it wouldn't fit

287
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,630
but it is a large complex composite

288
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,570
system I do a lot of security

289
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:10,770
architecture work for it about a year a

290
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:13,260
decade ago and so this this is a smart

291
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,630
city example it's adapted from a number

292
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:19,890
of examples that I found in academic

293
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:22,020
literature about smart cities and I've

294
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,279
been studying Internet of Things in sort

295
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,230
of my day job for a while

296
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,139
so I thought this is a fun example so

297
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,279
what's going on in this puppy you know

298
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,470
you got the kind of the users at the

299
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,999
bottom

300
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,040
passengers who want to buy tickets and

301
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:37,189
ride on the subway and that guy is

302
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,889
running cuz he's about to miss his train

303
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:42,990
and of course there's a database that

304
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,970
holds the user information then you kind

305
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,550
of have the the management system in the

306
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,589
center and has its own database which

307
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,229
probably isn't the same type of database

308
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:53,610
as the one below it you have some city

309
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,730
officials who want to administer an

310
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,769
oversight oversee this whole business

311
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,209
you have the whole ticketing system

312
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,939
right which has to deal with money and

313
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:06,239
credit cards and and all the regulatory

314
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:07,800
complexity that comes with that as well

315
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
as with these devices that are sort of

316
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,120
emplaced all around the city and

317
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,209
probably connected to the internet in 19

318
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,059
different ways you know you got an

319
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:20,339
external weather provider you have the

320
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,230
the buses and subway trains and traffic

321
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,620
lights and parking meters and all those

322
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,019
devices that are feeding you telemetry

323
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,300
and then you have the transit engineers

324
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,500
who want all this data and have their

325
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,309
own systems that they need it to

326
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,720
supplied to so and I wanted to make this

327
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:41,059
even more complex but it sort of

328
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,579
exceeded my PowerPoint skills I think

329
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:48,719
just this is not sort of that complex by

330
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:50,729
modern standards you know how many

331
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,589
people say I would say that this level

332
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,240
of complexity is sort of comparable to

333
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:58,680
the kinds of systems that you build or

334
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,300
test in your day job okay a few and a

335
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,128
few of the you were probably saying nah

336
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,769
the stuff I deal with in at work is way

337
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,959
more complex than this which is

338
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:10,110
certainly certainly true of my stuff but

339
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,128
done but like I said you know PowerPoint

340
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,699
there's a limit to how much you can fit

341
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,769
on the slide

342
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,508
this one's reasonable because it has a

343
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,189
lot of potential vulnerabilities right

344
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:18,750
you can see it just by looking at it you

345
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:20,519
got a whole bunch of internal interfaces

346
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:25,019
with arrows going every which way which

347
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:27,029
is in my experience very realistic you

348
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,579
know you have databases multiple of them

349
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,779
you have different types of users with

350
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,309
different rights and different

351
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,459
privileges and different expectations

352
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:37,260
and you have different interfaces right

353
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,209
you have a regular web interface

354
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:44,040
for browsers you got you know mobile

355
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,140
apps you have interfaces out to separate

356
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,040
devices like buses and trains and ticket

357
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:53,910
machines so I think is reasonably

358
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,880
reasonably realistic so so everybody's

359
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,949
memorized that we're gonna go on okay so

360
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,620
another important thing one of the first

361
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,520
principles we'll hit is that security is

362
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,190
about mission right we we impose we

363
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,490
build security into our systems because

364
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,960
that system has a job to do so the first

365
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,240
thing you have to know about a system

366
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,070
where you gonna secure it is what job is

367
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,380
it expected to do and which things are

368
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,820
more important than other things right

369
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,380
so for this system job one is safety

370
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,650
right we're talking about buses and

371
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:32,010
trains running around a city safety is

372
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,780
paramount you know next we got a privacy

373
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,140
thing right this is holding information

374
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,360
about people so it's got PII so we have

375
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,770
privacy things that are imposed on us by

376
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,410
a policy or state law etc and then you

377
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:49,920
want to optimize the the services and

378
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:54,890
the revenue right the city needs to take

379
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,910
in money to maintain the system and then

380
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,370
you know sustain the trust of the

381
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,500
citizens and important but less

382
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,330
important the other things get the

383
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,490
passengers where they need to go as fast

384
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,970
as they can

385
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,349
okay so let's move on now this is just a

386
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,630
restatement of some of the inputs and

387
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:16,290
outputs I like to draw this sort of

388
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,870
diagram for systems that I work on so I

389
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,190
can kind of enumerate or what are the

390
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,319
pieces of data they're expect to be

391
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,199
feeding this system what are the types

392
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,330
of users that it's expected to serve and

393
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,390
what external systems depend upon it

394
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,710
understanding those dependencies has

395
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:38,460
bitten me and colleagues of mine in the

396
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:41,430
but any number of times I'll give an

397
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,190
example or two as we go forward but it's

398
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:48,960
it's exceptionally important to

399
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,620
understand what those external systems

400
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,770
are counting on your system

401
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,320
to provide to them right and and how

402
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,470
that imposes security requirements on

403
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,730
your system that maybe didn't apply to

404
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,799
the human users okay okay so this is the

405
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,010
best part the actual principles now the

406
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,960
principles here are all sort of standard

407
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,330
security engineering principles but I

408
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,059
read an article a couple of months ago

409
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,860
and I really liked how the principles

410
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:20,668
were stated in that article so most

411
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:24,639
cases have adopted the form of wording

412
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,659
that that dr. sage reused and by

413
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,789
coincidence

414
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,510
dr. Sager is actually a colleague of

415
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:34,539
mine at NSA back in the early 90s he

416
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,240
worked there back then and on security

417
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:38,830
engineering in fact and then he went off

418
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,419
to the research community and other

419
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,770
stuff and but he's still doing security

420
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:46,960
engineering today and he decided to

421
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,879
capture his knowledge in in a book so

422
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,850
and in the middle of reading the book

423
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:58,149
but that's the article so why why use

424
00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:01,510
principles right and this is kind of a

425
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:03,428
serious question a lot of folks that I

426
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,279
have seen in my experiences that in

427
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:08,220
government do security engineering by

428
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,020
what I might call a checklist approach

429
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,679
you know they may have a approval or

430
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:17,080
accreditation set of boxes that they

431
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,090
have to check and they approach the

432
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,490
security of their system by saying well

433
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,110
I've got a box here that says I have to

434
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,870
have user authentication so I'm gonna

435
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:30,789
put that in and then I get to check that

436
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:33,209
box and that's not a sound way to go

437
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:35,679
about making your system trustworthy and

438
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,770
accomplishing the mission that that

439
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,159
system is intended to do all it really

440
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,960
achieves is checking boxes and what I've

441
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,010
found

442
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,350
especially when I came in to be the

443
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,850
security architect on a troubled project

444
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:53,949
in 2006 was that that approach doesn't

445
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,918
work it doesn't lead to systems that

446
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,200
actually are secure enough to hold the

447
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,679
sensitive mission data that you need

448
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,679
them to hold

449
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:08,639
so we use we create a very wide variety

450
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,269
of systems and simple rules are cool

451
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:11,340
right

452
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:15,299
you know validate your form inputs

453
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:17,129
remember to log key events all good but

454
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,580
it's not sufficient if you're going to

455
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:22,860
be engineering complex systems you need

456
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,649
rules that are general and applicable to

457
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,428
those complex systems all right so

458
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:31,080
sanitize form inputs is is a simple rule

459
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,299
of thumb that derives from a more

460
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,769
general principle of don't trust

461
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:40,350
externally supplied data and as I said

462
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,779
earlier the the most important thing

463
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,279
about picking the principles that you're

464
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,220
going to apply for your system and then

465
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,690
applying them consistently is not at the

466
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,190
beginning when you're building the

467
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,649
system and you understand all the parts

468
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,990
but like a couple of years later when

469
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:56,758
you're trying to maintain it and and

470
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,110
it's grown and it's gotten more complex

471
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,019
and it's interface to more other things

472
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:05,908
and that's when sticking to the

473
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:10,080
principles really matters ok so

474
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:16,730
principle number one we apply cyber

475
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,730
security in order to make mission go ok

476
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,620
you know within NSA we have tons of

477
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:27,210
different systems all right I'll just

478
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:30,600
pick one as an example particular one

479
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,639
I'm thinking about holds data from red

480
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,379
team's red team's go out I mean you've

481
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:36,449
all probably dealt with red team's they

482
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:39,149
go out they collect data about a system

483
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,340
they bring it back after they've done

484
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:43,529
their attacking and they need to be able

485
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,668
to write reports and understand the

486
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,379
vulnerabilities they found all those

487
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,190
other things but that data is very

488
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,809
sensitive

489
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,289
all right that's data about the

490
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:54,509
vulnerabilities of a real system and it

491
00:21:52,289 --> 00:22:01,529
needs to be protected it needs to be

492
00:21:54,509 --> 00:22:03,629
tracked who used it and how so the

493
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,460
mission goal in that case is prevent

494
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:06,870
that vulnerability information from

495
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,750
falling into the wrong hands

496
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,719
therefore you know that system has to

497
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,100
have certain security controls

498
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:21,200
okay so understand the mission that your

499
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:23,418
system is intended to provide and it's

500
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
sometimes easy to get away from that

501
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:28,580
when you're sort of down in the bowels

502
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,350
of coding some particular component but

503
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,879
you know try to get you know lift your

504
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,280
head every now and then and say okay

505
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,559
what's the big picture here I'm building

506
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,658
this you know particular web service

507
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,168
that's going to serve a mobile app but

508
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:43,640
you know what's the bigger purpose being

509
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:47,600
served by this whole you know

510
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:50,360
agglomeration of containers and web

511
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,870
services and databases in the example

512
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,559
right the mission purpose is getting

513
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,610
people around the city safely and

514
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:04,070
protecting and preserving the city's

515
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:06,049
investment in transit and so you know

516
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,760
all of our security principles should

517
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:11,059
somehow trace back to those mission

518
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,679
purposes okay you craft your security to

519
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,690
protect the mission functions prioritize

520
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,549
my mission importance and you might not

521
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,090
add some features because they would

522
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:22,190
conflict with your mission purposes I've

523
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:29,750
got a jokey example I think it's on the

524
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:32,179
next slide yeah okay so I'm sorry the

525
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,230
first bullet is kind of obvious you know

526
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,880
it's not just about installing

527
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,190
everything you possibly can and we'll

528
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,010
talk more about that later in the jokey

529
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,840
example residents of our city would love

530
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,360
to be able to adjust the traffic lights

531
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,360
so that they get green all the way to

532
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,580
work right but that might have some

533
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,299
safety implications for all the other

534
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,010
people on the roads if you know

535
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,230
individual passengers just like be

536
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,870
blocking the traffic lights anytime they

537
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,530
felt like it so we're probably not going

538
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:06,260
to include that feature because it

539
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:09,080
optimizes for goal number five improved

540
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:16,450
transit times at the cost of goal number

541
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:20,090
one you know which was safety right so

542
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,770
security about mission now if you really

543
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,809
understand and this is actually a

544
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,700
failing that I remember from earlier in

545
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,580
my own career

546
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:33,710
we were developing communication systems

547
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,629
for military folks and NSA culture we

548
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,129
were all about confidentiality and man

549
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:39,918
the state is going to be encrypted and

550
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:43,009
skinny encrypted really well and and we

551
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,629
had a good understanding of how other

552
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:46,100
nations tried to break our encryption

553
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:49,759
and we weren't gonna let that happen

554
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,860
and we forgot that the thing that

555
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,049
mattered most to these military users

556
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,990
was that their radio was up and

557
00:24:54,049 --> 00:25:01,059
available when they needed it okay and

558
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:03,950
that was a case where we sort of let

559
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:07,070
security controls that we knew a lot

560
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,809
about how to make and build run away

561
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,970
with us and we weren't thinking about

562
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,119
the end mission that that system was

563
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:16,190
supposed to be providing okay we're

564
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,889
better about that nowadays this is a

565
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:22,669
long time ago

566
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:24,649
okay principle number two security is

567
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:28,129
about understanding the risks to your

568
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:30,350
system and then mitigating them and and

569
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:32,719
this is a step that I've seen people

570
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,490
skip and it certainly applies in the

571
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,259
sort of checklist approach right if

572
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,850
you're just checking boxes you don't

573
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:42,860
know what risk your system is really

574
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:44,059
facing you're checking boxes so let's

575
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,658
see if I can think of another good

576
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:50,749
example there was a system I was working

577
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:53,809
on I ended up being the security

578
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:57,080
architect of it later that was intended

579
00:25:53,809 --> 00:26:01,158
to accept a whole bunch of sort of

580
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:05,119
real-time data from basically a combat

581
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:07,690
combat zone dangerous area and be able

582
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:12,678
to supply provide sort of real-time

583
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:15,139
warning or real-time alerting to just

584
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,029
you know military members if some event

585
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:20,959
was happening that was of interest to

586
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:22,070
them and that particular system accepted

587
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,950
data from a whole bunch of different

588
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:28,549
parties who were going to rely on our

589
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,110
system to protect that data right this

590
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:31,940
was data they never shared before it was

591
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,428
purely local but now they were going to

592
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,519
consider sharing it into this sort of

593
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,840
large pool so that we could give better

594
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,119
alerts

595
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,649
and more complete more informative

596
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,600
alerts out to to soldiers and stuff and

597
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:50,928
the person who is running that that

598
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,850
development program found that if he

599
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:56,179
couldn't clearly elucidate to these

600
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,649
other information holders how his system

601
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:02,359
was going to protect their information

602
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:05,090
they weren't willing to share it and so

603
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,249
we had to understand what risks they

604
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,529
thought were important to their data and

605
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:14,989
then be able to build the right security

606
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:18,019
controls you know in this system so that

607
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:19,999
it would mitigate the risks they were

608
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:21,739
worried about and so that we could

609
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:25,009
clearly explain to them yeah if you

610
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:26,299
share your data to us you know we're

611
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:27,769
gonna protect it in the following ways

612
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:29,899
right it's classified so we're gonna do

613
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:31,249
that and you know only people with

614
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,559
certain type of mission are supposed to

615
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,970
see it so we're going to do that and you

616
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,350
know we can only have it for two weeks

617
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:41,419
so we're gonna do that and so that was

618
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,369
critical and then once we could clearly

619
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,230
explain that to these other information

620
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:47,629
owners they were willing to put their

621
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,799
information in our system and it saved a

622
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:53,899
lot of lives so we had to understand not

623
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,700
only the threats that we envisioned but

624
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:59,889
the threats that these other people who

625
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,269
owned the information envisioned okay

626
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:04,369
and the other thing is it's really

627
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:07,700
important to understand the impact of a

628
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:09,590
threat alright you may say okay I'm

629
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,330
worried that my you know an attacker

630
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,119
might come at me and deny service to

631
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:18,799
this component what would the impact of

632
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:20,359
that be and if the impact is low you

633
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,989
might not choose to invest a great deal

634
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,699
in in protecting that component right

635
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:28,999
because security ends up being about

636
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,950
trade-offs you can't always provide all

637
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,989
the security features that you might

638
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,609
want because you know you got a job to

639
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:36,999
do you got to get this system out to out

640
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,999
to customers

641
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:48,220
yeah okay now this is this bits

642
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:51,100
important so when you think about this

643
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:53,830
particular principle it's sometimes

644
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,689
helpful to think about a risk that might

645
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,639
apply to data in your system and that

646
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,850
long-winded example I just talked about

647
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,600
was about about risk to data or risk to

648
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,070
compromise of the control of your system

649
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,310
all right so what would our impacts to

650
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,139
control most typical one that we see in

651
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:14,620
web web systems all the time are

652
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:18,640
injection attacks where an attacker

653
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:26,520
could come to your system and inject

654
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,520
something okay for for what sorry oh

655
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:36,790
okay sorry I think you're telling me I

656
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,560
had four of something sorry so right we

657
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,800
all know about injections command

658
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,500
injection and SQL injection lots of

659
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,210
bizarre types of XML injection I used to

660
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,280
study XML a lot so I thought those were

661
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:55,270
really cool so that's about control

662
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:58,540
right if an attacker can inject a scrap

663
00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:01,150
of shellcode that is going to end up

664
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:05,200
running on your server they've managed

665
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:09,160
to introduce some code execution that

666
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,290
you didn't want and is probably going to

667
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,120
do something nasty to your system that

668
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,879
that is going to be harmful to your

669
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,340
mission and then impacts are compromised

670
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,980
the data will hit in the next slide and

671
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,100
then lastly impact a comprises of access

672
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,810
and this is one where you know some

673
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,730
users are counting on your system being

674
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,110
up for them right they need to catch

675
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,950
their train to work and they need to buy

676
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:37,300
a ticket and if your system isn't there

677
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:42,670
for them then and these you know that

678
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:47,110
one obviously is availability so if you

679
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:49,300
understand how these impacts harm your

680
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,520
system or the mission that you're trying

681
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,930
to get your system to perform then

682
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,440
you'll better be able

683
00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:00,910
craft security measures that will reduce

684
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,760
or eliminate those impacts now we're

685
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,430
going to focus on data for just a moment

686
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,320
and this is an exercise that I've used

687
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,300
in security engineering and security

688
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,450
architecture context context several

689
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:18,970
times and that's find the crown jewel

690
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:21,130
data okay and it isn't doesn't always

691
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,930
show up where you'd expect I think is

692
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,110
the the lesson I learned from doing this

693
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,850
a lot so crown jewel data and there's

694
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,260
lots of ways to think about it but I

695
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,199
just picked a simple one for this

696
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,210
presentation the bottom access is how

697
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,210
important confidentiality is for your

698
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,770
data you know and it's if come from

699
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,390
confident shell is compromised

700
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,330
unauthorized parties got hold of this

701
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,970
data how high is the impact not much

702
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,370
impact on the left very very serious

703
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,590
grave impact on the right and then the

704
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:53,169
vertical access same thing for integrity

705
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:57,159
right if someone could compromise the

706
00:31:53,170 --> 00:32:01,150
integrity then higher-up impact is very

707
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,340
serious so your crown jewel data well

708
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,600
like let's look at bottom left corner is

709
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,970
stuff that you don't much care about the

710
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,969
confidentiality harm is low integrity

711
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,950
harm is low so cafeteria menus somebody

712
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:15,850
changes the ravioli to something else

713
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,470
you know not a big deal something where

714
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,949
the integrity is very important but the

715
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,330
confidentiality is not is time right

716
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,320
many of our systems depend on an

717
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,129
accurate idea of the time and but it's

718
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,409
not confidential

719
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,570
everybody knows the time is just not

720
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:34,570
allowed to change it it's supposed to be

721
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:38,169
accurate so that's kind of a in the top

722
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:40,929
left corner your crown jewel data is the

723
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,660
stuff in the top right corner where the

724
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:46,810
confidentiality impact is very high and

725
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,030
the integrity impact is very high and so

726
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,280
one exercise that you can go through for

727
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:55,930
understanding your risks is identifying

728
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:57,940
that crown jewel data and and then

729
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,740
saying okay if there's anywhere in my

730
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,420
system is handling the crown jewel data

731
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:05,190
that I'm going to pay extra attention to

732
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:07,200
testing it to ensuring that it has

733
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:15,990
her controls in place that it has proper

734
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:18,210
logging etc okay so let's think about

735
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,840
the example for a minute the smart city

736
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,530
system

737
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:26,040
what's the crown jewel data there the

738
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:28,560
credentials for the traffic control

739
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:35,070
system the thing that lets you adjust

740
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:37,530
the transit schedules and the parking

741
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,750
meters and always the the credentials

742
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,580
that let you do that stuff that that's

743
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,700
crown jewel data anybody gets hold of

744
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:48,230
that impact it's very high the passenger

745
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,970
trip records maybe crown jewel data

746
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:54,360
maybe maybe not they certainly have

747
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:57,480
privacy impact or regulatory compliance

748
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,149
impact if they're compromised and the

749
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,240
resident the PII about the the

750
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:06,510
passengers the telemetry data from the

751
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,290
buses and trains is probably critical to

752
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:14,699
both safe use of those vehicles as well

753
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:16,679
as managing them in a way that is good

754
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:19,500
for keeping them running like

755
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,060
maintenance so that may be very

756
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,100
important but that one maybe not you

757
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,889
know maybe the telemetry from the bus is

758
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,330
not that confidential anybody can

759
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,850
observe the bus going down the street

760
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:34,230
and say oh there it is but the integrity

761
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:37,110
might be very important okay if I can

762
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:39,240
reach in as an attacker and alter the

763
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,660
telemetry data so it always says the bus

764
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,370
has plenty of fuel after a few hours

765
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,040
that's really gonna disrupt the bus

766
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,080
system because nobody's gonna fuel up

767
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,500
the buses and they're all gonna like you

768
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,319
know stop running even more plenty of

769
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,720
examples in the train system as well

770
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:02,430
okay number three this is one of my

771
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:07,890
favorites and my friend Rob is a big fan

772
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:12,600
of this one as well understanding

773
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:16,859
security depends on understanding forms

774
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,690
of attack an old mentor of mine

775
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,059
who

776
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,770
actually also mentor of Sammy and is

777
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:26,559
mentioned in the in the foreword of his

778
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:29,180
book used to joke with new hires and NSA

779
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,770
what's a six-letter word that begins

780
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:35,839
with a that means evaluate and

781
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:40,400
everything and then he would shout

782
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,230
attack because he felt and and I still

783
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,030
agree with him that the best way to

784
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,670
really understand the security of a

785
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:49,220
system is to understand how it can be

786
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:51,430
attacked or ideally even try to attack

787
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,980
it and see how successful you can be

788
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:57,109
okay now there are many common types of

789
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,000
attacks especially in in areas that have

790
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:03,140
been sort of well studied like web

791
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,720
security and cryptography understand

792
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,578
those common types of attacks all right

793
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,680
and and the malicious tradecraft that

794
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,329
sort of depends on them a wasp

795
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,598
for example published as an excellent

796
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:16,099
top ten web vulnerabilities if you're

797
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,140
thinking about web security that's like

798
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,549
the best place to start is understanding

799
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,160
how each of those vulnerabilities work

800
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:25,630
and think about if you are an attacker

801
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,730
how could you take advantage of them to

802
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:33,559
gain advantage for yourself or to harm a

803
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:35,900
system ok next think about your

804
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:39,710
particular industry sector right so I'm

805
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:43,369
in government's I'd look at successful

806
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,579
attacks in that sector and think hey

807
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:49,069
what did the attacker do there and how

808
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:50,510
are they successful and would those same

809
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:55,190
that same tradecraft

810
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:56,119
work against my system ok and that's

811
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,349
kind of cool

812
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,819
for that sort of thing being an NSA

813
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,619
right because we have both a cyber

814
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:07,430
security mission and an intelligence

815
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:10,819
mission that is about quite frankly you

816
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,230
know exploiting foreign intelligence

817
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:16,308
targets in order to gain intelligence

818
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:18,559
and so I always joke that hey if I don't

819
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:20,960
have to wonder what a nation-state

820
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,609
attacker might do in a given situation I

821
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,250
can go down the hall and find one and

822
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:30,558
ask them so that's kind of fun but in

823
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,930
complex composite systems the attacks

824
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,069
are

825
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,990
often correspondingly complex okay so

826
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:39,509
you know there's always that that old

827
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,859
adage that the attacker has to the

828
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,920
defender has to cover everything the

829
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,930
attacker only has to be right once my

830
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,369
experience in in looking at attacks on

831
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,000
complex systems that's not quite true

832
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:52,619
anymore the system complexity usually

833
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,900
means that the attacker has to be right

834
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:57,720
a couple of times two three four times

835
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,240
in order to reach maybe that crown jewel

836
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,450
data or that critical functionality that

837
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,640
they're trying to interfere with and so

838
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,730
that's an advantage to you as a defender

839
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,440
you have sort of multiple chances to

840
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:15,030
block that attacker right maybe prevent

841
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,010
injection at your initial user web

842
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:20,250
interface but oh what if that succeeds

843
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,050
well now they're sitting inside a docker

844
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:24,240
container where my web server is running

845
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:28,410
how do I prevent them from making that

846
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:32,368
next step like back to the database and

847
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:34,618
so on okay so in the in the smart city

848
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:36,630
example if an attacker was intent on

849
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:38,400
corrupting the bus system so that they

850
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,400
could demand ransom from the city which

851
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,549
I think we all agree that's reasonable

852
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,930
scenario these days they might start

853
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:48,839
with the passenger website because

854
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:50,250
that's public anybody can access it jump

855
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:52,950
from there to the trip information

856
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:56,369
system which depends on information from

857
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,169
the bus operation system and once

858
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,839
they're in the bus operation system they

859
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,730
can you know screw up the bus schedules

860
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,369
and cause the buses to run out of gas

861
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:09,180
and all the rest of that kind of thing

862
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:12,559
okay for this is one that we we apply

863
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:15,540
religiously at NSA assume that attackers

864
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:19,020
already know the structure and operation

865
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,270
of your system if you know if you're in

866
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,410
a security meeting with your friends or

867
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:27,900
clients or enemies whoever and they say

868
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,509
well we don't think that that this

869
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,020
interface over here is subject to attack

870
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:38,240
because nobody knows it exists you can

871
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:40,470
like throw the BS flag okay

872
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,839
don't assume your attackers don't know

873
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,368
that your how your system works because

874
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:49,019
they will

875
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:51,720
and they can gain that all kinds of ways

876
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,640
you know I've talked to our red teamers

877
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,129
for example how did you figure out how

878
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,240
that that military system works that you

879
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,490
could get into it and they're like oh

880
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,769
well you know we just went around on a

881
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,508
bunch of websites and some dude had a

882
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,700
year old presentation where he explained

883
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:07,249
the architecture of the whole system

884
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,419
okay

885
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:11,368
another reason why I didn't get to put

886
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,420
the architecture of the u.s. SIGINT

887
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:17,880
system into the slide deck so you know

888
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,319
the documentation that's unwisely posted

889
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,650
how many times we read about people

890
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:25,859
leaving stuff in like public cloud

891
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:29,819
storage buckets that attackers could go

892
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:31,859
and pick up a classic one in web systems

893
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:34,380
or error messages you make your web

894
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,390
error messages really detailed and they

895
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,420
expose you know what software you're

896
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,950
using and maybe what version and how

897
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,259
your code is structured because they

898
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:48,960
give a whole back trace of where the

899
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:52,380
failure happened logs I've heard of

900
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,119
attacks where attackers were able to

901
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,950
find where the logs were backed up not

902
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,660
the primary location but the backups and

903
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,669
go read the logs and understand the

904
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,739
system from that and then of course some

905
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,799
systems can just have information leak

906
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:06,180
vulnerabilities and you may not think an

907
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:08,400
information leak is a serious

908
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,109
vulnerability but that's what heartbleed

909
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,319
was there's an information leak

910
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:15,390
vulnerability so that in that particular

911
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:18,480
case exposed crown jewel data like

912
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:25,589
passwords so don't rely on security

913
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:27,239
through obscurity yeah so start with

914
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:29,249
that premise that the attackers know all

915
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:31,470
your internal interfaces they may not be

916
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:34,410
able to reach them but they know they're

917
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:39,149
there hey I went to a really cool talk

918
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:42,558
about attacking a cloud system a couple

919
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:45,420
of years ago at the RSA conference and

920
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:48,269
there was a lot of that in there where

921
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,759
that particular attack they just went

922
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:53,399
after like internal interfaces that were

923
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:57,210
insufficiently protected by in that

924
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,180
particular case cloud policy you had to

925
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,870
know it was there

926
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:04,350
in order to attack it but you kind of

927
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:11,290
have to assume that they know that stuff

928
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:14,620
okay you know names of assets names of

929
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:17,920
api's and what parameters they take all

930
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:19,960
that stuff don't consider that stuff

931
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,100
secret and we are gonna there are some

932
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,240
things you do have to consider seeker

933
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,589
we'll talk about that in a minute but

934
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:29,169
this stuff don't think of it that way

935
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,370
okay oh yeah there whether it is there

936
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,530
are some things that you got to think

937
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:35,200
about is secret but you should keep

938
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:37,660
those things small and then protect the

939
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,350
heck out of them like the private keys

940
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:47,950
that that support you know your SSL or

941
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:49,509
TLS interface passwords tokens that you

942
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,830
may get from another system that permit

943
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,800
you to access that system for some

944
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,720
period of time those things you should

945
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,120
be more careful with I mean we've all

946
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,970
heard horror stories about people

947
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,250
leaving secrets like this in their code

948
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:06,339
repositories which then get uploaded to

949
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,680
github or some such thing and we laugh

950
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,620
about those things but unfortunately

951
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,029
they're still happening okay so think

952
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,420
carefully about where your secrets are

953
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:19,300
and you know make sure that they're

954
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:21,850
either encrypted and protected properly

955
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,590
or stored in some kind of system that is

956
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,650
specifically designed to store them and

957
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:29,800
only give them to authorized parties

958
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:33,040
that kind of stuff so for example in in

959
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,350
the smart city system if the bus

960
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,000
telemetry ingest is only supposed to

961
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:39,790
accept connections from the the

962
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,010
internet-of-things gateway right to

963
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:45,580
receive the the telemetry information

964
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:49,030
from the buses then that should be an

965
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,529
authenticated interface so that you know

966
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,680
in a variety of ways and writing lots of

967
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,360
mechanisms you can use to do that to

968
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,149
ensure that only the authorized

969
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,370
connections succeed don't assume that

970
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:03,100
the attacker just doesn't know where the

971
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,560
telemetry goes because they'll find out

972
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,950
and then they'll be able to inject false

973
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,610
telemetry into your into your system

974
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:15,350
okay principle five

975
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:17,670
integrity is a fundamental property

976
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,410
without integrity kind of everything

977
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:22,170
else falls apart because you can't rely

978
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:25,529
on it you might say during a security

979
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:27,450
review well I know that this access

980
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,670
control check will be enforced because

981
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:33,089
here it is in my code there's no way

982
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:36,240
around it the check always happens great

983
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:39,780
if your code does not have integrity if

984
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,109
if an attacker can reach in and change

985
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:46,160
you know your nodejs code or your your

986
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:49,020
you know java jars that you've uploaded

987
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,299
then they can easily make that bypass

988
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,630
happen and then the check that you're

989
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,940
relying on is not enforced so code

990
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,070
integrity is extremely important

991
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,950
protect your code your source code and

992
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:05,130
your build system as much or more than

993
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:07,140
your actual production system because if

994
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,970
the build system gets hosed you can't

995
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,779
rely on the on the production system

996
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:14,850
anymore protect the backups of your code

997
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,190
this is this is this next one be aware

998
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,890
of components of your system loaded from

999
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:22,890
elsewhere and I you know sort of ranted

1000
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:25,379
briefly earlier about modern platforms

1001
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,910
and how they load in dependencies this

1002
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,830
is a more serious problem than I

1003
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:32,940
realized I was taking a briefing from a

1004
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:36,569
specialist security company a couple

1005
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:40,470
years ago and they gave an example of

1006
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:42,630
the provenance and all the dependencies

1007
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:46,350
that went into a common open source

1008
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,660
system and you know ironically it was

1009
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,259
one that NSA had open sourced so I kind

1010
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,879
of felt bad about that

1011
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:58,740
simple system wasn't that complicated

1012
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:01,080
had over 700 dependencies out to five

1013
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,060
layers deep where the main system

1014
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,790
required X which required Y which

1015
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:14,880
required Z which letters which required

1016
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:17,700
W that's it's a lot to be aware of but

1017
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,700
it's important because if one of those

1018
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,379
things had a vulnerability and you

1019
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,430
didn't know about it you could be

1020
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,430
exposed right

1021
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,410
alright so there are various software

1022
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,260
analysis tools that can help with that

1023
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,870
and if your project depends heavily on

1024
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,660
external frameworks then you might

1025
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,609
consider using that type of tool along

1026
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,660
with your static analysis and other

1027
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:47,760
other code checking tools Hey

1028
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:53,879
configuration files obviously extremely

1029
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,200
important treat them just like code okay

1030
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,960
principle six I got to hurry up because

1031
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,680
I'm running out of time focus on secrets

1032
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,720
for a moment cybersecurity functions and

1033
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,759
the secrets that go with them are always

1034
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,279
going to be targets what's the first

1035
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,290
thing attackers go after these days when

1036
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,050
they get to a new system and gain entry

1037
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:16,560
they go after credentials okay whether

1038
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:18,930
those are SSH keys or you know user

1039
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,830
passwords or windows authentication

1040
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:27,180
tokens etc and so think about where

1041
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:30,870
those things are you know within NSA we

1042
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:33,089
do a lot of access controls using an a

1043
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,310
back model and there's a central system

1044
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:37,440
that knows all the users as rights and

1045
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:40,430
clearances and things like that that

1046
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,440
system is protected like crazy because

1047
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:46,919
you know what users are authorized to

1048
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,710
what data is sort of central to our

1049
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:54,330
entire protection model and it's also

1050
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:56,160
monitored like crazy and so forth modern

1051
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:59,460
complex systems embed a lot of features

1052
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,609
that use a lot of Secrets right password

1053
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,380
private keys tokens etc we already

1054
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:07,410
talked about the next bit segment your

1055
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,420
secrets don't you know let's say you get

1056
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,200
a private key and it's associated with a

1057
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,940
certificate for your public website

1058
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,430
that's great it's for your public

1059
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,930
website just use it for that don't use

1060
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,669
it for all your internal interfaces

1061
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,830
because now you've stored that really

1062
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,320
really important private key in nineteen

1063
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:29,299
different places inside your system okay

1064
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,300
we talked about crown jewel data already

1065
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,690
yeah

1066
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:37,790
some secrets are definitely going to get

1067
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:40,110
compromised right you end user passwords

1068
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:42,420
some end user is always going to get

1069
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:44,160
their password stolen or something

1070
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,590
think about what the impact to your

1071
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,890
system is and then build in recovery

1072
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,660
measures right think about it if you if

1073
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,150
you're if a user called you up and said

1074
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,190
you know so in our smart city example

1075
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:59,340
let's say it was the mayor and just to

1076
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:01,590
make a jokey example says my password to

1077
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:05,310
managing the entire subway system has

1078
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:07,890
been stolen how quickly could you turn

1079
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:11,310
off all the mayor's privileges so that

1080
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:13,319
the the attacker that stole his password

1081
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:18,750
would have no ability to harm your

1082
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:20,220
transit system okay yeah that's too

1083
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,700
complicated in an example we'll skip

1084
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:27,870
that one assume your system will have

1085
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:30,750
malicious insiders unfortunate truth

1086
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:33,900
these days NSA has had its share of

1087
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:37,370
issues with this you can't eliminate

1088
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,960
that threat because you know even an

1089
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:42,630
insider who isn't malicious but does

1090
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:46,710
something accidental and stupid can can

1091
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:49,290
cause harm to your system so you have to

1092
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:51,420
think about reducing that impact right

1093
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:56,670
my personal insider threat mitigation

1094
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:59,040
model is deter detect and defeat one of

1095
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:02,670
the security principles inside NSA is

1096
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,830
that no action is anonymous every action

1097
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:08,240
is tracked back to an either an

1098
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:10,529
authorized user or an authorized system

1099
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,910
not just user to have credentials all

1100
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:16,380
the systems have credentials too and you

1101
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,089
only want to give each of those entities

1102
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,070
as much privilege as they actually need

1103
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:23,670
to do whatever job they're they're being

1104
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:25,170
asked to do and then of course once you

1105
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,660
have all this information about who's

1106
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,430
doing what you can't just let it sit in

1107
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:34,339
a database somewhere you have to analyze

1108
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:34,339
it and and look for misbehavior

1109
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:41,940
so consider an insider in the transit

1110
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:44,039
system they're responsible maybe for

1111
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,739
vehicle management and maintenance okay

1112
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:48,809
this is you know an individual who fixes

1113
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:51,690
the trains when they break that's a very

1114
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:54,239
very important job but it has nothing to

1115
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:57,239
do with the ticket system or selling

1116
00:50:54,239 --> 00:51:00,690
fares or dealing with credit cards so

1117
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:02,849
make sure that that user only has access

1118
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,049
to the vehicle maintenance logs and

1119
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:06,690
things of that nature if they need to do

1120
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:08,190
their job and doesn't have like sort of

1121
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:12,599
global privileges throughout the system

1122
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,979
and then a really simple analytic that

1123
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,779
you can use to look for this sort of

1124
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:18,808
misbehavior is just looking for

1125
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:20,599
permission denied log entries you know

1126
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:23,339
average user have a few of those a day

1127
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,400
some person has several thousand maybe

1128
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:30,328
that's something you'd want to look into

1129
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:33,479
okay understand the security that your

1130
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:35,279
system relies upon from external service

1131
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:37,558
providers or platforms this is

1132
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:39,479
especially important in sort of hosting

1133
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:41,430
provider cloud providers sort of cases

1134
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:43,558
you're gonna write your system it's

1135
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:47,279
going to run off prem on some cloud

1136
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:50,819
service that's cool what does it depend

1137
00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:53,489
on the cloud provider to give you and

1138
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:55,979
what parts do you have to build in all

1139
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:59,099
right understanding that division is it

1140
00:51:55,979 --> 00:52:01,259
can be very difficult and then the parts

1141
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,900
that the cloud provider does offer you

1142
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:08,579
how do you configure those correctly and

1143
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:10,349
sustain them over time okay and that

1144
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:12,329
applies to sort of your standard cloud

1145
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:15,299
providers you know Google Microsoft

1146
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:17,579
Amazon etc it applies to places where

1147
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:21,569
you put your source code and other

1148
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:29,339
artifacts like a github all those sorts

1149
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:31,349
of services okay so in the example right

1150
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:33,869
the vehicle telemetry data is very high

1151
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:35,489
volume so the city is not attempting to

1152
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:39,509
process it all themselves they run it

1153
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:41,789
through a cloud provider and it gets

1154
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:45,029
stored there until it's until it can be

1155
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:48,730
forwarded so understand what the cloud

1156
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:52,360
provider provides and which bits

1157
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:55,570
you have to provide okay we're almost

1158
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:58,330
done hanging there and then the flip

1159
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:02,110
side of that coin is understand what

1160
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:04,720
security your system is offering that

1161
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:07,030
others are depending upon and I've seen

1162
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,620
this bite folks in my work plenty of

1163
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,050
times

1164
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:13,299
there was this one particular system

1165
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:16,690
that performed a validation check on a

1166
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,430
certain type of important data and it

1167
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,110
was very convenient was easy to use a

1168
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,399
whole bunch of other things depended on

1169
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,780
it they would like to send these pieces

1170
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,760
of data the system it would validate

1171
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,250
them report back that one's good that

1172
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,040
one's not so good

1173
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:33,520
the folks who ran that system didn't

1174
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,560
fully understand how many other systems

1175
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,910
were relying on them and the extent in

1176
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,200
which they relied upon this was

1177
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,509
accidental but it could have been a

1178
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,730
malicious attack turned out to be an

1179
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:45,040
accident thank goodness and that system

1180
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:47,470
went down and like all these other

1181
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,480
systems ground to a halt because they

1182
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:52,049
were all synchronously waiting for their

1183
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:56,280
little validation requests to come back

1184
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:58,630
right and that was an availability

1185
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,550
attack against one little systems

1186
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:04,750
accidental but it was still an

1187
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:07,690
availability compromise where the folks

1188
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:09,280
involved had no idea the extent that

1189
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,350
their little available in the

1190
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,120
interruption we would like you know

1191
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:17,440
screw up the mission of all these other

1192
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:19,900
systems okay your system may be a source

1193
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,200
of data upon which others rely for its

1194
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:25,570
integrity or its confidentiality they

1195
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,129
may store data at your system which

1196
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,230
they're counting on you to protect like

1197
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:32,530
that other example I talked about with

1198
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:36,520
the real-time alerting system they may

1199
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:38,920
count on your system to be able to

1200
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,340
provide provenance information about

1201
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:46,180
data on which they rely financial data

1202
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:49,600
for example okay in in the smart city

1203
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:52,870
example if you remember the diagram the

1204
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,549
telemetry data came through our system

1205
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:57,400
before going out to the transit

1206
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,830
engineering systems and I'm looking back

1207
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,240
at that later like was that a good idea

1208
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,200
you know maybe the telemetry data should

1209
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,180
have gone straight to the

1210
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,049
and engineers but you know sorry we're

1211
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:10,509
stuck with it no budget to change it um

1212
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:13,329
so now we have a dependency the transit

1213
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:15,790
engineering system depends on our system

1214
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:18,130
to ingest that data with integrity and

1215
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:20,589
provide it within certain latency bounds

1216
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:23,349
out to the transit engineering system

1217
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:25,599
and understanding that dependency would

1218
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:28,240
change how we engineer our system and

1219
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:33,010
how we protected it finally number 10

1220
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:37,299
plan for failure okay plan for

1221
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:39,160
compromise you know some part of your

1222
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,619
system will experience a security

1223
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,970
problem or it may get compromised

1224
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:45,670
through an attack or even an accident

1225
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:48,339
like that example I gave earlier if you

1226
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:50,740
plan for that event if you think about

1227
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:53,859
the failure scenarios that would have

1228
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:56,828
high impact for your system then you can

1229
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:58,660
greatly reduce the mission impact and we

1230
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:00,670
all know about simple stuff like assume

1231
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:04,078
you're going to lose data and and go you

1232
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:06,250
know rehearse restoring from backup

1233
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,930
seeing plenty of systems that didn't do

1234
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:13,420
that but still we all know that one

1235
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:15,609
already but you know somebody red team's

1236
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,680
your system or does some pentesting

1237
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:19,089
against it can you see the evidence and

1238
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,960
the logs can you understand what they

1239
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:24,759
did do you have mechanisms for halting

1240
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,930
malicious behavior if and when you

1241
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:31,150
detect it do you have mechanisms

1242
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:34,750
you know let's say an attacker gets into

1243
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,010
your system and you know three-star

1244
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,170
general is breathing down your neck

1245
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,940
saying I need to know if that data has

1246
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:43,030
still has integrity if I can still trust

1247
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,560
that data right I'm sure

1248
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:48,730
someone may I don't care if it leaked I

1249
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:50,279
need to know if I can trust it right you

1250
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,710
need to be able answer that question

1251
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,420
because if you can't the general was

1252
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,780
gonna assume that he can't trust that

1253
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,880
data and mission gets called off and

1254
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,450
everything has to be rebuilt and and you

1255
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:07,089
know a lot of a lot of problems so you

1256
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:09,790
know think about backup and encryption

1257
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:11,560
best practices hold exercises do

1258
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:13,740
rehearsals drills that kind of thing

1259
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,740
right

1260
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,390
and last topic which I'm gonna have to

1261
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,210
rush through because I'm just about out

1262
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:23,058
of time is maintaining security right

1263
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:24,260
complex step composite systems are never

1264
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:27,890
static they're always getting new

1265
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:30,380
functionality bolted on the sides assume

1266
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:32,808
your system is gonna change identify the

1267
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,390
key elements that can't change because

1268
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:39,230
external parties depend on them that's

1269
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:42,440
very important and and then incorporate

1270
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:44,349
testing of that sort of into each stage

1271
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,690
of testing in your pipeline

1272
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:50,869
right if you're doing some you know

1273
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,640
integration tests you know before

1274
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:54,680
something goes out of production

1275
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,680
actually attempt some unauthorized

1276
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,930
things and make sure that they in fact

1277
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,848
generate the proper permission denied

1278
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:05,868
log messages and and don't give you data

1279
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:07,609
and things of that nature okay you know

1280
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:10,549
this is standard stuff right keep your

1281
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:14,230
parts of your system loosely coupled and

1282
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:17,359
and independent that's pretty normal and

1283
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,710
updates and patches are critical make

1284
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:22,069
sure that you have the ability to do

1285
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:27,730
that and then it's built into your into

1286
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:30,950
your build system and last one

1287
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:33,710
decommissioning someday your system is

1288
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:36,500
gonna be replaced or taken offline or

1289
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,910
transition to something new and think

1290
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,740
about what am I going to do with all

1291
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:42,529
that data right

1292
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:45,919
it may be compliance critical or have

1293
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:48,319
regulatory implications you know I've

1294
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,720
seen situations where systems at the end

1295
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,980
of their life were considered no longer

1296
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,640
important and weren't patched and

1297
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:57,260
updated and then they got attacked so

1298
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,299
think about how you dispose your data

1299
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:02,420
how you transition the critical secrets

1300
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:04,640
securely to the new system preserve the

1301
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:08,210
critical logs and properly dispose of

1302
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,819
everything else okay so that's it these

1303
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:13,549
are kind of standard conclusions and I

1304
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:15,740
have like one minute for any questions

1305
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:17,210
and I'm sorry I kind of got caught up

1306
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,209
with my anecdotes did enough leave

1307
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:22,130
enough time for QA but does anybody have

1308
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:24,619
any questions about these security

1309
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,750
principles that was just ten out of you

1310
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:28,970
know however many hundred but I think I

1311
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:32,040
hope that you felt they were good ones

1312
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:35,189
hey all right

1313
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:37,170
I'm at a time so thank you very much and

1314
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,600
please apply these security engineering

1315
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:42,400
principles

1316
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,400
[Applause]

1317
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,040
you
