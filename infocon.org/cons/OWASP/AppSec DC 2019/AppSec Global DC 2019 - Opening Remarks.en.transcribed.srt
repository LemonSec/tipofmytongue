organization that works to improve the

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,489
security of software we've been doing

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,440
this for almost 20 years

17
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,019
we're the largest organization in this

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,019
space we have over five million people

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,100
visiting our website every year we have

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,439
almost 50,000 people taking part of our

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,510
activities worldwide with their chapters

22
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,679
and projects and I'll talk about that in

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,990
a minute

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,450
we're community-led so everything that

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,839
happens at us is volunteers we have a

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,270
very very small paid staff which helps

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,340
with operations but all the content all

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,530
the chapters all the conferences

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,659
everything is done by volunteers we have

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,100
the local team here that help bring up

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,400
this conference give them a round of

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,399
applause

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:38,240
and OS sets the standards for software

34
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,610
security a lot of industry standards

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,908
like PCI like HIPAA like other standards

36
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,000
reference our resources our projects so

37
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:49,520
it's a great organization to be part of

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,619
and that brings me to with the next

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,960
topic getting involved we would like to

40
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,490
get more few guys involved there are

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,429
already a lot of people in this room

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,919
that are involved but we need more help

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,590
so what do we need so the easiest way to

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,160
get involved with us is with a local

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,380
chapter if you have a chapter where you

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,600
live you probably do if you don't you

47
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,690
can start one if you have one you can

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,489
join one go to meetups speak in a

49
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,760
chapter of meaning we always need more

50
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:21,290
content do something to support the

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,380
chapter that's great

52
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,709
the next thing we need help with is

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,709
projects so OS has over 130 projects at

54
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,989
any given moment from obviously OS top

55
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,299
ten that you all know to code based

56
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,940
project training projects outreach

57
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,120
projects there's a lot of stuff we do

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,950
and you can look it up in our website

59
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,709
help a project contribute content

60
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,420
contribute code that always helps and it

61
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,549
feels great to build something that

62
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,768
other people are using five million

63
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,920
people on our website every year and

64
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:57,290
then finally we are bringing back the

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,850
committee's so if for those of you have

66
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,840

67
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,609
committees up until six seven years ago

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,140
and now the board has decided to bring

69
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,329
back the committee's there's just too

70
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,238
much work to be done at the board level

71
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,920
and we need more people to volunteer

72
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,630
with the committee's was the chapters

73
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,970
communities with the project committees

74
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,820
the committees are basically helping the

75
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,030
board be in touch with the community

76
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,040

organization any organization is better

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,560
when there's a diverse set of people

123
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,560
involved this year the ojas foundation

124
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,980
has granted about $100,000 worth of

125
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,210
scholarships reduced membership dues and

126
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,980
also student memberships available to

127
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,260
most anyone that ever asked most of the

128
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,180
time to increase the diversity of the

129
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,860
people that are involved with the

130
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,540
community if you would have been here

131
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,910
yesterday for instance and actually we

132
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,380
did this also in Tel Aviv we're also

133
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,560
doing why should not doing in Europe and

134
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,320
the two weeks from now but we often

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,210
offer a specific training class that is

136
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,030
that's sponsored by the women in app sec

137
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,260
community we had 40 women that came and

138
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,520
attended that training conference

139
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,349
yesterday and many of them are still

140
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,299
here for the rest of this week in the

141
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,010
conference you'll also notice in this

142
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,380
conference as well as the most recent

143
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,389
conference we had in Tel Aviv half of

144
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,280
our keynotes are women and that is

145
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,590
deliberate we want to make sure that

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,799
there's a good share of voice and a

147
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,570
diversity of a conversation happening

148
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,710
and to fix some of the justices that

149
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,550
have been done in the tech sector when

150
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,549
it comes to diversity

151
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,350
this is the first of a long journey of

152
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,240
conferences I will let you know that we

153
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,340
have Amsterdam conference was happening

154
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,229
in two weeks from now we will have a

155
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,909
European conference that is set for June

156
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,159
we don't have a location we're down to

157
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,350
three different sites and that'll be in

158
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,310
June of 2020 and we'll be returning to

159
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,860

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,949
conference rooms are all the vendors

169
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,719
will be set up there visit our sponsors

170
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,460
this is one of the ways we're able to

171
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,050
put off these conferences and charge so

172
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,280
little for the event relative to other

173
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,919
conferences because we have a good

174
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,090
support from our sponsors I will not put

175
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,740
it in a slide but I'll tell you buy

176
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,989
products from our sponsors that's also a

177
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,979
good thing to do if you'd like and the

178
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,840
other thing I will tell you is to give

179
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,810
us feedback when you walk out of all the

180
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,969
session rooms you'll see a QR code also

181
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,169
at the end of the speakers every speaker

182
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,780
except for the keynotes should have a

183
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,340
slide they'll also have a QR code just

184
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,270
go ahead and scan that code and then

185
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,830
pick the session that you want to

186
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,000
provide feedback it's the way that we

187
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,400
can make sure that we get better

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,840
speakers the next time and also improve

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,698
the conference so we really need your

190
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,020
feedback to continually improve the

191
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:56,490
