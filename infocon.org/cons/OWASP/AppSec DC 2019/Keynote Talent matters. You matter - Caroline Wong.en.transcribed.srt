1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:15,750
I would like for you to close your eyes

2
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:15,750
and join me in a deep breathing exercise

3
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:27,539
take a deep breath in and let it out

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,539
take a deep breath in and let it out

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:41,950
take a deep breath in and let it out

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:46,870
open your eyes last year I found myself

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:49,840
in an unusual situation my boss Jacob

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:54,010
Hanson asked me if I would like to lead

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,070
the people function at Cobalt do the

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,289
thing is my title is chief security

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,469
strategist I've worked in security for

12
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:05,649
almost 15 years I'm very passionate

13
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:09,220
about people that's why I created the

14
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:10,780
humans of InfoSec podcast but I've never

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,250
actually worked in human resources

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,650
before Jacob said to me look we're

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,990
really onto something here the company

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,500
has found a product market fit and our

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,270
impact on the industry continues to grow

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,979
now the most important thing we can do

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,048
is to focus on our people in 2019 we

22
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,280
will elevate Cobalt adios people

23
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:37,090
function to be a world-class

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,000
organization to do this we must build an

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,400
environment that cultivates personal and

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,450
professional performance growth and

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,939
happiness in order for Cobalt do to be

28
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,759
successful in the near and long term we

29
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:56,008
must attract acquire and retain great

30
00:01:51,759 --> 00:02:00,820
talent today I lead both people and

31
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,130
security at cobalt dot IO when I joined

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,908
the company three years ago I was the

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,600
eighth employee today the team is 92

34
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:14,110
people strong and we expect to grow to

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,200
105 by the end of this year it has been

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,650
super fun and I'm really excited to see

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,510
where the journey takes us next

38
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:28,120
so that's a little bit about why why

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:31,659
people matter at cobalt thought IO next

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,140
I'm going to talk about OPSEC and why

41
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:38,500
people matter a knapsack I'm going to

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:44,048
talk about what we're able to accomplish

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,299
as humans that machines can't do I want

44
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:49,120
to address our industry is skill

45
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:54,069
shortage and the resulting burnout that

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:57,519
many of us experience I want to share an

47
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,409
example of some cognitive behavioral

48
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,250
therapy that I've worked on personally

49
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:06,519
and I want to conclude with takeaways

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,909
for both hiring managers that are trying

51
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:16,780
to build and retain great teams as well

52
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:19,108
as for each of us as individuals so why

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,790
does AB SEC matter in the first place

54
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,810
it's because the internet was never

55
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:30,730
intended to do what it does today

56
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:33,090
in 1969 for university computers at UCLA

57
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,548
Stanford USB and the University of Utah

58
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,079
were connected via ARPANET a project

59
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,549
started by the Defense Department's

60
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:44,109
Advanced Research Projects Agency in

61
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,900
1985 the National Science Foundation

62
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,239
established NSFNET a network of

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,109
scientific computers that served

64
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,400
scientists researchers and engineers who

65
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,879
worked for the National Center for

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,459
Atmospheric Research these people study

67
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:05,048
the atmosphere and its interactions with

68
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:07,419
the oceans land and Sun a decade later

69
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:11,859
the internet was being used to support

70
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:14,680
electronic commerce during a 1998 US

71
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:17,380
Senate testimonial a group of security

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,048
researchers explained that the internet

73
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,668
was not designed for it

74
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,039
they described the academic and

75
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,190
scientific objectives of getting

76
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:30,010
computers to talk to each other

77
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,080
quote the internet grew up it flourished

78
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,440
it struck everybody by surprise and now

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,359
big

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,730
business is saying well let's jump on

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,140
board and make some money off this well

82
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,240
this is kind of like if you've driven in

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,250
Boston the streets aren't tremendously

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,260
designed in a wonderful fashion because

85
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,570
they followed the cows around and laid

86
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,490
the pavement down I mean you can get it

87
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,620
to work but it can be really painful in

88
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,040
2003 the first version of the OWASP top

89
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,380
ten was published and in 2011 Marc

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,370
Andreessen wrote software is eating the

91
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,350
world and so here we are application

92
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,850
security is a problem because we use the

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,970
internet for things it was never

94
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,810
designed to do and so many things depend

95
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,140
on software when value shifts from the

96
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,070
physical world to the digital world

97
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:23,289
protecting that value has to shift to

98
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,630
today there is tremendous demand for

99
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,530
applications security talent and not

100
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,000
enough supply the latest is e-squared

101
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,369
research study on the cyber security

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,340
workforce reports that the world is in

103
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,919
need of almost 3 million more security

104
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,590
professionals how do they come up with

105
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,630
this number the study states this

106
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,760
calculation takes critical factors into

107
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,950
consideration including the percentage

108
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,140
of organizations with open positions and

109
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,780
the estimated growth of companies of

110
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,940
different sizes the calculation of

111
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,950
demand includes the openings that are

112
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,169
currently available along with an

113
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,229
estimation of future staffing needs and

114
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,530
the calculation of supply includes

115
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,630
estimates for academic and non-academic

116
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,969
entrance into the field along with

117
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,740
estimates of existing professionals who

118
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,900
are pivoting to cyber security

119
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,610
specialties the thing is that just like

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,919
any other business initiative a

121
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,110
successful application security program

122
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,450
needs the right balance of people

123
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:32,050
process and technology tools are useful

124
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:34,960
but no tool is a silver bullet and any

125
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,770
type of application security technology

126
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,900
still requires people and the right

127
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,799
workflows to be effective I want to talk

128
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,080
for just a moment about why I'm

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,659
fortunately all of our applications

130
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,020
security problems can't simply be solved

131
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:56,180
by using technology the thing is that

132
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,180
computers are really good at doing

133
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,370
exactly what you tell them to do they're

134
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,060
not so good at thinking creatively or

135
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,889
applying business logic even the most

136
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,599
sophisticated machine learning

137
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:11,930
techniques are still vulnerable to

138
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,270
concept drift the idea that machine

139
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,840
learning predictions are made by using

140
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:20,359
pattern matching against old data the

141
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,698
old data never exactly matches the new

142
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,060
data so the predictions can never be

143
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,879
exactly right to me this is sort of

144
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,190
obvious if someone built a machine that

145
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,949
could accurately predict the future that

146
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:38,810
would be awesome to my knowledge this

147
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:41,629
does not exist yet I want to share an

148
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,139
analogy that has to do with using a

149
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:47,780
machine to correct spelling errors let's

150
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:52,630
talk about a spell checker spell checker

151
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:55,609
is extremely useful but it's not perfect

152
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,789
look over there at the drawing on the

153
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,370
whiteboard their ideas are articulated

154
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:05,169
nicely they're going to take a picture

155
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,169
and share it with the rest of the team a

156
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:10,009
spell checker program sees nothing wrong

157
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:14,270
with the spelling of these words but a

158
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:15,680
human does similarly when it comes to

159
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,440
something like finding security

160
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,800
vulnerabilities in software Computers

161
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,590
can't find everything only humans can

162
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,349
find business logic flaws and these are

163
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,878
some of the most interesting and most

164
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:33,198
severe security vulnerabilities that

165
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,260
exist in his 2011 a wasp presentation

flaws username recovery flaws and the

170
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,720
following ecommerce business logic

171
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,630
attacks altering the price of an item

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,930
before checkout and bypassing payment

173
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,910
validation before shipping an item it

174
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,290
would be super convenient if you could

175
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,500
just buy a piece of technology that

176
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,640
would do everything for you

177
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,110
unfortunately application security

178
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,300
scanners and firewalls can't solve

179
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,060
everything their effectiveness is

180
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,880
directly related to the skills and the

181
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,540
manual effort of the people who must

182
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,610
tune them to a specific environment

183
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:22,969
monitor them regularly and filter the

184
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:25,519
signal from the noise okay the internet

185
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,680
wasn't built with security in mind the

186
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,560
world has a massive skills shortage and

187
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,260
we can't rely on automation to solve

188
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,060
everything what's happening to the

189
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,730
people in this scenario if you're on an

190
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,369
application security team I'm willing to

191
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,060
bet that you have more work to do than

192
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,829
time and resources to do it maybe one of

193
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,899
your colleagues left for a new job last

194
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,410
month and there are two additional

195
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:56,720
unfilled positions on your team you

196
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,550
could actually be in a position where

197
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,230
you're trying to do the jobs of four

198
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:05,060
people an issa study found that 70% of

199
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,390
cybersecurity professionals feel

200
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,099
impacted by the talent shortage

201
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,720
resulting in an increased workload and a

202
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,690
situation where teams spend more of

203
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,610
their time fighting fires than focusing

204
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:23,720
on training planning or strategy this is

205
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:26,170
the perfect setup for burnout burnout is

206
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,700
described as a state of chronic stress

207
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:32,229
that leads to physical and emotional

208
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,180
exhaustion cynicism and detachment and

209
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,450
feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of

210
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,859
accomplishment severe burnout means that

211
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:44,270
you can no longer function effectively

212
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,920
on a personal or professional level the

213
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,399
tricky thing is that burnout doesn't

214
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,250
happen overnight sort of creeps in

215
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,050
gradually in this sneaky way that fools

216
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,750
us into thinking that living in a state

217
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:01,729
of constant stress is normal and

218
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:05,120
acceptable living in a state of constant

219
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:08,779
stress is not normal and it should not

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,180
be acceptable our industry has a burnout

221
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,960
problem we have a massive skills

222
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,810
shortage and for as long as that's the

223
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,940
it is absolutely critical that the

224
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:22,310
professionals in our industry take care

225
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:24,630
of themselves because the world needs us

226
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,270
what we're capable of bringing to the

227
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,700
table as healthy happy functioning

228
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:34,560
professionals is simply too valuable to

229
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:37,920
lose early in my career I used to put up

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,069
with being treated poorly because I

231
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:46,520
thought it was normal I used to treat

232
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:50,399
myself poorly - I don't do that anymore

233
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:55,199
self-care begins with believing that you

234
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,570
deserve it I want to talk to you about a

235
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,810
concept called cognitive behavioral

236
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,420
therapy the basic idea is that our

237
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,489
thoughts emotions and behaviors are all

238
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,370
connected and that you have the power to

239
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:12,330
change or at least influence one by

240
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:14,580
changing another to do it you identify a

241
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:18,300
negative thought process and you try to

242
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,520
change it into a positive one it's

243
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,740
easier said than done because our

244
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,709
negative thought processes are often so

245
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,310
deep-seated in our brains that we don't

246
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:33,079
even realize that they're there I'm

247
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:36,510
going to talk through a personal example

248
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,640
my parents are immigrants and they

249
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,069
raised me to be able to take care of

250
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,310
myself and to have as many choices in

251
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,620
life as possible when I was growing up

252
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,640
doing well in school was a really big

253
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:54,029
deal as a child and teenager I did well

254
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,829
in school and that felt good but when I

255
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,980
started the electrical engineering and

256
00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:00,510
computer science program at UC Berkeley

257
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,940
all of a sudden that part of my identity

258
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:08,339
changed it took me decades to develop

259
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:12,360
the core belief that I'm smart and I

260
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:14,820
work hard unfortunately over time I also

261
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,880
began to develop a few associated core

262
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,150
beliefs that are quite negative and

263
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,930
self-defeating my worth comes from my

264
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,850
success in school and in work if I am

265
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,609
not calm

266
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:32,980
gently exceeding expectations then I am

267
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,230
a failure I need to work harder and

268
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:42,440
unless I am succeeding I don't deserve

269
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:46,279
to be treated well over the past 10

270
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,069
years or so I've worked hard to try and

271
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:54,860
replace these negative belief processes

272
00:13:49,069 --> 00:14:00,560
in my brain with positive ones I accept

273
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:05,870
myself as I am right now I know myself

274
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:10,699
and I approve of myself I embrace

275
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:16,970
balance I encourage myself to play and

276
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:19,099
into a joy and to enjoy life it's time

277
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,490
to shift gears and talk about some key

278
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,649
takeaways for hiring managers I'm going

279
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,069
to share some of the strategies that we

280
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:34,279
use at cobalt Daioh to attract retain

281
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:37,269
and grow great talent first you want to

282
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,670
attract great people I'll tell you what

283
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,139
when it comes to application security

284
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,589
pretty much everyone with strong skills

285
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:47,509
and experience already has a job

286
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:50,029
they're not super likely to go to your

287
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:53,480
company's job website and submit the

288
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:56,329
resume that's not to say that inbound

289
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,189
candidates can't be valuable but you

290
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,399
can't rely on them alone to fill your

291
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:03,500
positions you've got to be proactive and

292
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,930
opportunistic when it comes to

293
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,230
recruiting you need to go out and find

294
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,888
the people that you want to hire you

295
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,709
will need to do a lot of outreach if you

296
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,470
have a great recruiter this person can

297
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:21,800
help but I think the best person to do

298
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,920
outreach is the hiring manager I know

299
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,699
that this takes time and that time is a

300
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:32,540
precious and a finite resource it's a

301
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:35,149
matter of prioritization if you want to

302
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,240
attract great people you need to make

303
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,360
hiring a priority if you find someone

304
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,130
amazing

305
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,579
and they don't happen to exactly match

306
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:47,399
your original job description consider

307
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:52,109
revising the job description or changing

308
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,550
your hiring strategy once you've made an

309
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,399
offer to a candidate and they've

310
00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:00,180
accepted your next priority should be to

311
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,980
keep them assuming they perform some

312
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,959
employee retention programs have perks

313
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,240
like free snacks and paid gym

314
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,310
memberships but I've come to realize

315
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,149
that what really matters to people is

316
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,579
something different in 2012 Google

317
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,550
conducted a study to try and figure out

318
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:19,920
how to build the perfect team they

319
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,170
examined everything from how frequently

320
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,430
people eat together to comment rates

321
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:28,010
between the best managers they analyzed

322
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,689
180 teams throughout the company and

323
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,769
reviewed half a century's worth of

324
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,440
academic studies on how teams work

325
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:40,350
surprisingly the data didn't seem to

326
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,410
show that a mix of specific personality

327
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:48,630
types skills or backgrounds made any

328
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:50,850
significant difference it turns out that

329
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,939
what does matter is something called

330
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,350
psychological safety a sense of

331
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,839
confidence that the team will not

332
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,500
embarrass reject or punish someone for

333
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,209
speaking up teams are always going to

334
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,660
have their issues regardless of whether

335
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,970
people talk about them or not team

336
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,400
members that trust each other are more

337
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,949
likely to share information so these

338
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,470
issues can come to the surface and be

339
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,470
managed efficiently and proactively

340
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,860
another thing that it's absolutely

341
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,500
critical for hiring managers to do is

342
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:34,049
grow their people I think this matters

343
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,500
even more when it comes to application

344
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,389
security it's important for every

345
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,910
business function to have well-defined

346
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,250
levels so that team members understand

347
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,340
what is expected of them in order to get

348
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,200
to the next level reviews don't have to

349
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,790
be onerous but they should be structured

350
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,780
so that team members can have productive

351
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,240
conversations with their managers

352
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,300
about where they are today and where

353
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,490
they're headed tomorrow high-performing

354
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:05,290
individuals should be acknowledged and

355
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:08,920
promoted when I began my new role as

356
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:10,960
head of people at cobalt auto I asked

357
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,560
our people Operations Manager for a book

358
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,650
recommendation she told me about a book

359
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,500
called sapiens one of the concepts that

360
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,410
this book talks about is how humans can

361
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,440
create and maintain culture through

362
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,570
one-on-one relationships this works

363
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,490
until a group is about a hundred people

364
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:36,100
big after that point something more is

365
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:40,150
needed to support and force cultural

366
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,909
values when cobalt was growing from

367
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,070
eight to fifty people it was easy enough

368
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,400
to involve pretty much everyone in the

369
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:51,040
hiring process this way we made sure

370
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,740
that every single new hire added to our

371
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,920
culture in a positive way that aligned

372
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,710
with our core values as we prepared for

373
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,350
growth from 50 to 100 we knew it was

374
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,720
time to write down our values in order

375
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,240
to scale people decisions on who to hire

376
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,560
who to promote and who to transition out

377
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,500
of the company Jacob and I did not sit

378
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:18,820
down privately and write these things

379
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,890
down in January the entire team we were

380
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,800
about 50 people at that time got

381
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,860
together for a q-1 q-2 kickoff in Miami

382
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,860
and at the end of our sessions Jacob

383
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,949
said to everyone please stand up we're

384
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,919
gonna stand in a circle and then one by

385
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,320
one he called about a dozen of our

386
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,810
employees into the middle of the circle

387
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,480
he said Robert koogler please stand in

388
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,060
the middle of the circle I think that

389
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,310
Robert exemplifies cobalt Auto values

390
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,159
because he has amazing enthusiasm and

391
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:55,060
optimism and then he invited everyone

392
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:58,740
else to talk about what cobalt values

393
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:01,240
they believe Robert Kugler demonstrates

394
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,440
people said Robert gets his hands dirty

395
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,750
he just does it

396
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,680
he's collaborative he's always trying to

397
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,120
figure out how to make thing

398
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,830
faster and better using automation and

399
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,020
then Jacob asked Julie Kurt to step into

400
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,600
the middle of the circle

401
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,450
he said Julie takes initiative and she

402
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,070
has amazing energy people chimed in and

403
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,950
they said we love her positive attitude

404
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,230
and her optimism we love that she cares

405
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,330
so deeply and she's so dedicated to her

406
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,640
work that she has a strong work ethic

407
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:34,949
that she gets things done and takes

408
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,850
responsibility Jacob said Wolfgang

409
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:41,110
please step in in the middle of the

410
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:44,199
circle Wolfgang is humble and he was a

411
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,560
great listener the team trained him and

412
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,930
they said Wolfgang stands his ground

413
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:54,100
he's not a pushover he's appreciative

414
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:58,570
and he shows gratitude he also follows

415
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,179
through Jacob said Marian please step

416
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:04,899
into the middle of the circle Marian is

417
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,340
structured and she's systematic people

418
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,310
chimed in and they said she's humble

419
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,250
she's hard-working she's motivated she's

420
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:18,610
a sweetheart customers love her and she

421
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:20,380
gets done so in this way meanwhile

422
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm sort of like franching Lee typing

423
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,910
into a Google sheet and I'm writing down

424
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,760
all the things that people are saying

425
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,970
and over the next couple weeks following

426
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,550
the off-site I invite the entire company

427
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:37,600
to join me in this Google sheet and add

428
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:40,810
their contributions and together we come

429
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,689
up with the following at cobalt on i/o

430
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,669
we are humble learners what we did

431
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,770
yesterday may not work tomorrow so we

432
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,650
approach problem-solving with a creative

433
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,570
growth mindset we understand that

434
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,640
occasional failure is part of a natural

435
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,790
learning process when trying something

436
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,580
new we humbly seek to learn from subject

437

and KPI focused we seize opportunities

we know there is no time to waste we say

462
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,699
no to what is not important and deliver

463
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:14,639
the right results at the right time at

464
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,889
cobalt IO we know that when we

465
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:20,459
collaborate we can make two plus two

466
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:21,928

each constituency to cobalt adios

473
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:42,090

474
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:48,539
and show gratitude for one another we

475
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:51,299
lift each other up so that's some stuff

476
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:55,919
for hiring managers here is some stuff

477
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:58,590
for all of us I want to tell you about

478
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,639
something that I realized a few years

479
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,678
ago for those of us that have and are

480
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:07,260
developing skills in application

481
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,250
security there's a beautiful silver

482
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:15,269
lining to the to the skills shortage and

483
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:17,429
that is that we have choices in 2016

484
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:19,019
my daughter was a year old and it was

485
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:20,730
becoming apparent to me that my

486
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,970
lifestyle as a traveling management

487
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,860
consultant needed to change I began to

488
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,750
search for a local job

489
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,309
and I spoke with 15 different

490
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,940
organizations about various information

491
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:36,178
security roles that's an extremely

492
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,679
fortunate position to be in for me one

493
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,410
of the coolest things about becoming a

494
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,059
mom is it my sense of what I want and

495
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:47,880
what really matters to me has become

496
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:51,059
much clearer in the past I've worked on

497
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,750
toxic teams I worked in toxic work

498
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:56,760
environments

499
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:59,520
it sucks during my job search in 2016

500
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,460
the number one criteria i looked for was

501
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,639
people that I like and respect who like

502
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,280
and respect me it turns out that being

503
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,760
surrounded by people that I trust makes

504
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,399
my life a lot better every single day

505
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,919
when I can go to work and look forward

506
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:22,260
to seeing my team that's a good day my

507
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,870
number two criteria during this job

508
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,020
search was the ability to have a big

509
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:30,659
impact and that's why for the first time

510
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:36,960
in my career I decided to join a startup

511
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:40,200
and it's been awesome I have another

512
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:49,350
recommendation and this is something

513
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:54,179
that I have worked on myself we are so

514
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:58,770
good at learning stuff about technology

515
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:02,120
and about security events we are pros in

516
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:06,030
getting all the technical details right

517
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:09,439
it's a different thing to try and get to

518
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:15,750
know yourself sometimes that's actually

519
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:18,179
harder to do I recommend that you try to

520
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,880
get to know yourself that you pay

521
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:24,870
attention to how you feel and you manage

522
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,970
your energy accordingly there are a lot

523
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:31,500
of techniques and strategies about

524
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:34,850
managing ones time but what about your

525
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:38,100
energy there's only 24 hours in a day

526
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,590
but depending on your energy level you

527
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,779
can either feel completely

528
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,199
pleaded and like you have nothing left

529
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:47,149
to give or you can feel inspired like

530
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,789
your tank is full and like you can

531
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:52,340
accomplish anything

532
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:54,679
find out what gives you energy and what

533
00:26:52,340 --> 00:27:02,509
takes it away from you and choose your

534
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:05,330
activities accordingly sometimes people

535
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:08,690
ask me what kinds of self-care things I

536
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:12,139
do for myself and so I thought I would

537
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,379
share some of them here so I broken this

538
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:20,748
out into three categories mind body and

539
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:24,559
spirit meditation is something that for

540
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:27,799
me was actually pretty intimidating to

541
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,418
try and start doing but luckily they

542
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,369
make iPhone apps for this kind of thing

543
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:33,499
so you can just download a meditation

544
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:35,869
app and press play and just listen and

545
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:40,460
just close your eyes and it actually

546
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:43,249
does not a bad job journaling is another

547
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,820
one of those things that can be hard to

548
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:49,490
make time for I was going through a

549
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:54,200
difficult period in my life in the

550
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:56,559
winter of 2012 and 2013 and I tried an

551
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,529
exercise that had been recommended me to

552
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:03,559
recommended to me by a friend she said

553
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:05,539
put a notebook by your bed and when you

554
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,940
wake up in the morning the very first

555
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:10,610
thing you do even before you pick up

556
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,369
your phone and even before you walk over

557
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:17,479
to the bathroom grab your notebook and

558
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:20,269
write down anything write anything down

559
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,610
just fill a page and you never have to

560
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:24,110
go back and read it but there's this

561
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,658
interesting thing that happens when

562
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:30,740
you're transitioning from sleep to being

563
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:32,809
awake where I actually believe you can

564
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,899
get some information from your

565
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:39,529
subconscious that's harder to access

566
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:41,748
when you're awake so I know that

567
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,009
particular exercise which I did for

568
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:46,450
about a month

569
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:49,240
led me to a very important decision

570
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,320
which was to divorce my first husband

571
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,970
that was like

572
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,020
one of the best decisions I've made in

573
00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:02,450
my life I've been going to weekly

574
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:04,850
therapy for a decade now and there's

575
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,460
something super cool about talking to

576
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,860
someone for 50 minutes and the whole

577
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,560
point that person is there is to listen

578
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,030
to you and they're not a part of your

579
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,919
life they're not in your life they don't

580
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,100
have any agenda or objectives they're

581
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,520
just there to listen to you and to

582
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,230
support you and there's something really

583
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,230
awesome about that even if you have

584
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,460
great friends or great partner that you

585
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,990
feel like you can talk to which is a

586
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:36,050
wonderful thing for me having an amazing

587
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,150
therapist provides something different

588
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:43,580
in my life that has been hugely

589
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:48,440
beneficial to me I'm medicated and that

590
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:51,710
really helps me I have insurance so in

591
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:56,900
addition to struggling with depression

592
00:29:51,710 --> 00:30:00,350
and alcoholism I also struggle with

593
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,960
anxiety now that I have two young

594
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:05,600
children I struggle with a whole another

595
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,560
kind of anxiety and so I bought life

596
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:13,490
insurance and there I feel a little less

597
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,679
anxious I think it's really important to

598
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,740
take vacation and you don't have to take

599
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:22,400
three weeks and go to Bali you can take

600
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:26,690
a day and do nothing I think it's really

601
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:30,680
important if this is your thing to do

602
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:35,840
art to create something that has no

603
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:40,670
particular productive use but which is

604
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:45,260
purely for your own pleasure when it

605
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:52,670
comes to self-care techniques for my

606
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:56,020
body I try to get sleep I try to nourish

607
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:59,540
myself it turns out I love cooking

608
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:03,399
sometimes I try to exercise and I wrote

609
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:06,469
care and what I mean by this is

610
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:10,609
like go to the doctor like one last time

611
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:12,919
he went to the doctor I myself have not

612
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:15,199
been to the doctor in like a while and

613
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,269
it's because it always feels like it's

614
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,840
not that important that it could always

615
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:23,719
wait and I can't carve out you know

616
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,908
three hours and a day to look the

617
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:29,679
appointment and commute over there and

618
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:35,989
wait in the waiting room but really I

619
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:38,869
should go to the doctor and so forth and

620
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:41,599
spirit I think that it's important to

621
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:43,668
try and surround yourself with people

622
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,029
that you like and respect who like and

623
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:49,729
respect you I think it's important and

624
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:53,359
we have a unique opportunity in this

625
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:55,999
industry to choose a job where you can

626
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,269
have real impact we have that

627
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:00,950
opportunity in this industry I think

628
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:05,059
it's super important to spend time with

629
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:08,599
family and friends and pets and to

630
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:11,229
create tribes of people I think it's

631
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:14,779
important to have a gratitude practice

632
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:16,519
sounds pretty cheesy but another thing

633
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:20,239
that I do to combat my personal anxiety

634
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,369
is when I is this something that my

635
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:26,509
therapist and I work on together when I

636
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:29,658
have an anxious thought I try to replace

637
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:31,519
it with a grateful thought there's this

638
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:35,179
idea that the mind can only hold on to

639
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,669
one thing at a time and if I'm busy

640
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:40,489
thinking about what I'm grateful for

641
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:45,830
there's less room in my brain to think

642
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:48,200
about what I'm worried about and it's

643
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:55,158
nice to have rituals whatever that may

644
00:32:48,200 --> 00:33:01,249
mean for you so now I'm gonna end my

645
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:04,789
talk with a guided meditation I'll ask

646
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:07,700
you to indulge me and consider closing

647
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:10,800
your eyes we're going to start with

648
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:30,660
another few deep breaths

649
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:37,220
I am at peace with myself I appreciate

650
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:41,040
Who I am I value myself as a person all

651
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,030
people have value and I am a valuable

652
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:48,510
human being

653
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:53,850
I deserve to relax I deserve to be happy

654
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:58,890
I embraced my happy feelings and enjoy

655
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:02,550
being content when my mood is low

656
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:05,550
I accept my emotions and recognize that

657
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:09,029
the low mood will pass and I will be

658
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:15,860
happy again I look forward to the good

659
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:19,679
times my future is bright and positive I

660
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:24,870
look forward to the future and I enjoy

661
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:29,310
the present I look fondly upon many

662
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:36,029
memories from my past I forgive myself

663
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:40,168
for my mistakes all people make mistakes

664
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:43,230
I used to feel regret about some of my

665
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:45,899
mistakes because I'm a good person and I

666
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,210
want to do the best that I can and now

667
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:50,790
I'm still a good person and I release

668
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,480
the feelings of regret because I've

669
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:57,810
learned and moved on I forgive myself

670
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,330
for errors I have made because I've felt

671
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:02,460
bad about them long enough I have

672
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:06,330
suffered long enough and now it's time

673
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,580
to be free by freeing myself from past

674
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:15,480
mistakes I can move on and do good

675
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:18,270
things I forgive myself I imagine and

676
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:22,410
believe that these things are true for

677
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,930
me right in this moment and I enjoy the

678
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:28,430
relaxation that I am accept

679
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:29,690
Riaan Singh I feel good about Who I am

680
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,078
today

681
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:37,190
I accept the person that I am

682
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:41,240
I accept my flaws I accept my strengths

683
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:43,460
I view my shortcomings as strengths not

684
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:50,029
yet developed rather than as weaknesses

685
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:51,440
I really develop new strengths I imagine

686
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,510
and believe that all of these

687
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,849
affirmations are true for me right now

688
00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:00,410
in this moment and I enjoy the

689
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:04,849
relaxation I am experiencing I approach

690
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:07,520
challenges with strength I do the best

691
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:10,309
that I can at the time I give 100%

692
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,319
effort when I am able and when I choose

693
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,819
to put full effort toward the things

694
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,960
that are important

695
00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:22,040
I accept my imperfections and the

696
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:26,329
imperfections and what I do my efforts

697
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:30,109
are good enough and they're okay I do

698
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:33,619
not have to be perfect to be okay as a

699
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:37,279
person I am a human being with flaws

700
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:42,920
I enjoy being Who I am and I love myself

701
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:44,750
as I am I feel secure in Who I am and I

702
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:49,970
do not need to compare myself with

703
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:56,030
others all the strengths that I have

704
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:58,939
ever had is present in me today I still

705
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,829
have the same positive character even if

706
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,910
not all of my strengths are shown right

707
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:07,520
now I have all of those strengths of

708
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:13,460
character and will use those strengths

709
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:16,190
again I imagine and believe that all of

710
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,530
these affirmations are true for me right

711
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:23,210
now in this moment and enjoy the

712
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:28,880
relaxation I am experiencing I accept

713
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:33,079
myself I care for myself I take time for

714
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,109
myself and enjoy it I deserve time for

715
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:37,460
myself and I feel good about taking this

716
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:43,609
regularly

717
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:46,309
I handle difficulties with grace I allow

718
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:51,670
myself to experience and express

719
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:56,470
emotions both negative and positive I

720
00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:03,349
accept myself I am perfectly alright

721
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:09,339
just the way I am I accept myself I'm a

722
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:16,010
valuable human being I accept myself I

723
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:25,730
feel confident I accept myself I feel

724
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:30,890
secure I accept myself in a moment

725
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:38,030
I'll count to three one take a deep

726
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:43,960
cleansing breath in and exhale slowly to

727
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,960
take another deep breath and exhale

728
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:58,359
three open your eyes you are feeling

729
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,359
calm confident and refreshed thank you

730
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:13,270
[Applause]

731
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:17,299
so we have some time if you want to talk

732
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:22,250
and if you want to talk there are some

733
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:25,309
microphones there right here and if you

734
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:30,589
want to you can walk over to one of the

735
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:32,390
microphones and you can talk hello thank

736
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:34,910
you

737
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:38,569
do you have some thoughts on practical

738
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:41,000
ways to help teams do more self-care

739
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:43,490
I've certainly been in teams where I say

740
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,059
hey you work the weekend take the day

741
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:49,220
off and that that doesn't help other

742
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:52,010
employees actually go home how can we

743
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,950
encourage this behavior with our team

744
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:57,770
you know other than just telling them to

745
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,680
do it which which doesn't work I think

746
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:05,559
that's a fantastic question how can I

747
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:08,930
help my team do more self-care I

748
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:14,240
actually think that the best way to do

749
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:19,790
this is to lead by example so if you say

750
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:22,069
to your team hey we just spent the last

751
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:26,058
three weeks recovering from a major

752
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:28,730
incident I appreciate all the work

753
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:32,990
you've done I am gonna take a few days

754
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:36,799
off and I think you should too I do not

755
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:40,640
expect to see you in the office another

756
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:43,460
thing that I do personally is actually

757
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,799
talk about my therapy at work so on a

758
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,950
Friday afternoon I meet with my

759
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:51,950
therapist at 3 o'clock and if I'm in the

760
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:55,250
office and it's 2 o'clock I begin to

761
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:57,348
pack up my bags and I say bye

762
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,599
I'm going to my weekly therapy

763
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:06,859
appointment now I'll see you guys on

764
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:09,980
Monday there's another thing which this

765
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:17,029
is like applies to some people more than

766
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:18,530
others but for me personally I used to

767
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,230
wear a lot of makeup and I used to spend

768
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:25,160
a lot of time on like my wake up in hair

769
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,900
and now I don't and most of the time I

770
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,950
am actually wearing a little make-up

771
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,740
right now because this is being

772
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:37,730
videotaped but in general I don't and

773
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:42,109
and I go to the office and I do video

774
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:45,440
conference calls all day and I noticed

775
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:47,720
other people in the office coming to the

776
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,810
office with less makeup and I thought

777
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:55,509
that was pretty cool so I think that a

778
00:41:50,810 --> 00:42:00,410
lot of it has to do with seeing a leader

779
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:07,100
do these things for themselves I've

780
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:10,279
actually had so cobalto is a security

781
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,750
vendor we have a presence at the RSA

782
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,820
security conference I'm actually on

783
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:19,610
their advisory board I planned to attend

784
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,620
that conference from Saturday to the

785
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:26,060
following Friday and when I left my home

786
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:29,660
my husband and my two young children

787
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,540
were both sick and I said to my husband

788
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,040
if the baby's temperature goes over 102

789
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,050
I'm getting on a plane and I'm flying

790
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,759
home and on Tuesday afternoon I'm in the

791
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,710
middle of a panel talk and my phone

792
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,800
starts beeping right now my phone is on

793
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:49,970
airplane mode and my husband says the

794
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,160
baby's fever has hit 102 and as soon as

795
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:56,209
the panel's over I go to my boss and I

796
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:00,830
say Jacob my baby is sick I'm going home

797
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:02,240
and he says to me how can I help and I

798
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,590
was like this is amazing and I was like

799
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,540
well I have three more talks to do this

800
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,280
week so if you could do them and he was

801
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,770
like I will help you figure them out he

802
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,780
actually personally took one of them and

803
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:15,310
I asked an amazing friend and colleague

804
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,310
to do a couple on my behalf

805
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:22,190
Jacob said to me you know Caroline I

806
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:25,459
actually think that by you choosing to

807
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,540
prioritize your family in this way he

808
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,890
was like I think you're actually gonna

809
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,330
get asked to do more speaking

810
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,069
engagements he's like I think it's great

811
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:34,589
for your brand I was like cool

812
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:37,288
and then I looked at his calendar this

813
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:39,359
week and during our one-on-one Tuesday

814
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:43,259
morning I said Jacob I saw that you have

815
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,598
apps SEC DC on her calendar I'll be

816
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:48,900
there too we should meet up and he said

817
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,549
actually I'm going to Iceland and I was

818
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,699
like cool what's in Iceland he was like

819
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:55,890
there's a boys trip with my friends from

820
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:57,479
high school and he said ever since I

821
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,089
started this company six years ago I've

822
00:43:57,479 --> 00:44:02,549
never gone on the boys trip because I

823
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:04,739
thought it wasn't worth my time I

824
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:06,859
thought that you know I'm the CEO of

825
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:09,390
this growing company I should be at work

826
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:12,538
and he said but I realized that life is

827
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:15,839
short so I'm going to Iceland I said

828
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:18,509
great let me know what I can do to

829
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,660
support you and have a great time and be

830
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:23,519
safe I just wanted to say thank you for

831
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,109
being so vulnerable here today for

832
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,390
people I mean what you shared though it

833
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:29,009
was impressive and there's probably a

834
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,479
lot of other people myself included in

835
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:33,119
this room have gone through things like

836
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:35,899
that and it's imperative I think for

837
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,309
leaders not only in this field but

838
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,900
anywhere in life if you're a parent

839
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,150
you're a leader if you're in your

840
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,209
community you may be a leader certainly

841
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:47,549
in this field too and touching on all

842
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:49,948
three the body mind and spirit we're not

843
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:51,420
machines you know we're human beings and

844
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:52,829
we're made of that and it's so

845
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,920
imperative that we take care of all

846
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:58,049
three or we end up drying up and being

847
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,349
like a prune right so thanks for sharing

848
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:04,739
what you did today you're welcome

849
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:08,009
I kind of wanted to wait to see how

850
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:11,190
awkward it would get but and this isn't

851
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:13,650
like the kind of question maybe you're

852
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,269
thinking of but listening to you're

853
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,180
talking about vulnerability and about

854
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:20,430
therapy and kind of leaders were hearing

855
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,799
it reminded me a lot of brené Brown talk

856
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,969
on vulnerability in her books I'm not

857
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:28,529
sure if you're familiar with that

858
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:32,579
awesome so I guess I would like to hear

859
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:34,289
more about maybe how which concepts of

860
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,319
hers you've tried to take consciously

861
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:39,059
into your current role going from you

862
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:42,240
know technical security it sounds like

863
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:45,250
into a big you know holistic people

864
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,910
responsibilities which is a big

865
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:53,049
responsibility and extremely important

866
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:56,558
thank you so I am familiar with the work

867
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:59,380
of brené Brown if you are not familiar

868
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:02,680
with her work on vulnerability I highly

869
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:07,059
recommend her TED talk she also has

870
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:09,399
several excellent books she basically

871
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,329
says that all humans really want

872
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,240
connection

873
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:16,059
and that a good way to actually

874
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:23,649
establish connection is by being

875
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:26,980
vulnerable this is not aligned with a

876
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:31,119
lot of the world's cultures it's also

877
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:35,589
not necessarily aligned with our

878
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:41,259
industry's culture our industry is all

879
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:44,529
about finding problems and trying to

880
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:49,779
prevent problems and trying to fix

881
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:53,680
problems and so we're always so aware

882
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:58,059
that there are so many problems and then

883
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:02,730
in some places we're like not allowed to

884
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:09,579
talk about the problems and that creates

885
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:12,789
something funny I have done over the

886
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:17,140
past couple of years different versions

887
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:19,599
of this talk there's another version of

888
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:22,839
this talk that I gave it b-sides in San

889
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:27,369
Francisco where I go like pretty deep

890
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:30,038
into some of my own problems there was a

891
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:34,539
woman who watched my talk that day in

892
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:39,369
San Francisco and she said to me how

893
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:44,559
open are you with your co-workers about

894
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:46,299
this stuff and I said to her I'm pretty

895
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,980
sure this talk is being videoed and it's

896
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:53,640
gonna be available to the public on

897
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:55,910
YouTube so I'm super public about it

898
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,900
that does not mean that you need to

899
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:01,879
be public about your story it's taken me

900
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,980
a long time to get to this point and

901
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,020
there's also all sorts of weird stuff

902
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,500
that I'm not gonna stand on a stage and

903
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:16,569
talk about the reason I've chosen to do

904
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:21,470
this is twofold one of them is because

905
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:24,650
if somebody who hears this talk can

906
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,470
relate to something that I've said then

907
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:31,940
that person might feel a little less

908
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:34,189
alone and if somebody hears this talk

909
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,940
and feels inspired to share something

910
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:39,410
about them

911
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,730
with someone that they trust then that

912
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,460
might help them too

913
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:45,079
I think there are baby steps not

914
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,670
everyone needs to get up on a keynote

915
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,589
stage and tell the world about your

916
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:54,740
mental health problems that is not for

917
00:48:48,589 --> 00:49:01,730
everyone but you could tell your best

918
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:04,149
friend or your sister or your therapist

919
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,339
or you could write an email to yourself

920
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:13,210
so there are all these ways where I

921
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:18,970
think that self-awareness helps on the

922
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,970
journey to self-care and happiness and

923
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:25,549
the most important person to think about

924
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,660
these things is you if you choose to

925
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:30,890
share them with someone that you trust

926
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:32,750
and that you feel like is gonna respect

927
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:36,259
what you have to say and support you

928
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:41,180
then that's awesome

929
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:44,390
but it's it's totally up to you I am

930
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:47,808
very impressed from your speech from

931
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:51,379
your talk and it personally motivates

932
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:54,859
all of us I write here one question I

933
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:59,569
have for you is like if you find someone

934
00:49:54,859 --> 00:50:01,848
in a position like they do care for

935
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:04,430
people they have the right feelings for

936
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:06,349
everyone else right it could be social

937
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,819
it could be work-related or it could be

938
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:11,610
any any place but sometimes by

939
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:13,950
you feel like that the perception that

940
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:17,450
people have developed is not who you are

941
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:20,279
then what would you recommend to

942
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:23,129
overcome that situation and help them

943
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,070
that may help someone to overcome that

944
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:31,770
barrier not being perceived differently

945
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:35,850
than who they are so if I can paraphrase

946
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:38,610
that what I think I heard is sometimes

947
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:41,640
people are well-intentioned and they can

948
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:44,750
be misunderstood did I understand that

949
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:51,299
correctly yes correct

950
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:54,750
and what do you do about that I think

951
00:50:51,300 --> 00:51:00,840
that it's okay so we have this cultural

952
00:50:54,750 --> 00:51:06,240
thing where culturally we are encouraged

953
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:08,160
to like smile and like we greet each

954
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:13,919
other and we're like how's it going

955
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:15,720
and sometimes when people ask you're

956
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,980
like you don't actually give a

957
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,750
about me you're just saying that because

958
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:23,400
that's what people say and you're just

959
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:26,430
expecting me to be like great and that

960
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,040
is we have this like avoidance of

961
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:33,919
conflict thing and the avoidance of

962
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:38,100
conflict gets in the way because for

963
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,350
functioning relationships it's good for

964
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:46,970
us to be straightforward and honest with

965
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:51,049
each other I'll give you an example I

966
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:57,540
have an amazing recruiter on my team and

967
00:51:51,050 --> 00:52:00,750
he said to me the hiring manager gave me

968
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:03,350
the impression that this role is

969
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:06,900
supposed to have person a and person B

970
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:09,980
reporting to him or her this other

971
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:13,950
stakeholder is under the impression that

972
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:17,420
the new role is supposed to have person

973
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:21,799
C and person D reporting to him or her

974
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:24,320
what I do about it and I said

975
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,600
you should write a message in black and

976
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,480
white to the hiring manager and to the

977
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:32,779
stakeholder and say I think I've

978
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,270
identified a disconnect my understanding

979
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,980
is that you think that this role is

980
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:39,740
supposed to manage person and person B

981
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:42,530
and you think that this role is supposed

982
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,830
to manage person see in person D I'd

983
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:47,300
like for all of us to talk about it and

984
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:49,130
I think this kind of I think this can

985
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:54,830
apply when a person is well intentioned

986
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:58,030
and misunderstood in the United States

987
00:52:54,830 --> 00:53:01,610
we have this thing that happens where we

988
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:06,410
have lots of different people with

989
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:08,900
different cultures and what is a sign of

990
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:13,339
respect or a sign of affection or a

991
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:18,250
humorous thing to one person might be

992
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:20,240
strange or offensive to another and so

993
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:25,130
sometimes we have to smell these things

994
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:28,970
out and it's totally fair to say hey

995
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:32,710
person I observed such and such behavior

996
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:36,020
I heard you say such and such thing and

997
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:39,320
the way that I interpreted it was and B

998
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:41,720
and C was that the way that you meant

999
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,690
for it to come across I would like to

1000
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:52,970
talk with you about it so I think they

1001
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:55,280
you know that's what I do I wonder what

1002
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:58,910
advice do you have for parents or

1003
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,250
would-be parents for how to teach the

1004
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:03,950
concept of failure and how to recover

1005
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:08,030
from it to their children which I've

1006
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:11,439
seen recently that a lot of parents are

1007
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:17,660
enforcing an absolute success like you

1008
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:21,950
talked about so this is a topic that I

1009
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:27,290
think about a lot because I have kids

1010
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:31,700
and I personally struggle with on one

1011
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:34,540
hand a desire for my children never to

1012
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:38,189
experience any pain or suffering

1013
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:41,560
and at the same time a recognition that

1014
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:43,960
they will experience pain and suffering

1015
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,730
and there's some things that are

1016
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:52,690
mistakes that they need to make on their

1017
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:58,810
own I like for my kids to make mistakes

1018
00:54:52,690 --> 00:55:03,940
and fail in front of me because then I

1019
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:05,170
can say to them you tried and it didn't

1020
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:09,990
work out the way that you thought it

1021
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:17,230
would and you should try again

1022
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:22,390
sometimes there are safety things I have

1023
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:24,250
a four year old daughter and we've been

1024
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:28,060
to the emergency room twice in the last

1025
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:30,940
six months one time she was running

1026
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:35,020
around in the kitchen with her socks on

1027
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:39,670
and she tripped and fell and her teeth

1028
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:42,370
cut into her lip and the face and the

1029
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:47,200
mouth are like a very bloody place it

1030
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:48,970
was just like you know and we go to the

1031
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,129
ER and she's fine thank goodness

1032
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:55,419
her teeth actually didn't go through her

1033
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:59,410
lip so she didn't need stitches and now

1034
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:05,980
she knows she shouldn't run around with

1035
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:09,460
socks another time she thought it would

1036
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:13,990
be a good idea to put a small piece of

1037
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:17,680
apple in her nose to see what would

1038
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:23,189
happen and then she couldn't get it out

1039
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:28,720
and so we went to the emergency room and

1040
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:32,170
we did get it out when I take my

1041
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:37,000
daughter to the park so at 4 years old

1042
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:40,540
she's actually pretty capable at two

1043
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,720
years old she was less capable some

1044
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,640
parks have a section for little kids and

1045
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,279
a section for big kids

1046
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:53,230
and sometimes the sections or big kids

1047
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:56,799
have climbing structures and I am the

1048
00:56:53,230 --> 00:57:00,400
type of parent who I encourage her to

1049
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:05,559
climb the structure and I stand right

1050
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:08,380
next to her but I don't help her because

1051
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:10,900
if I help her then my concern is she

1052
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:13,869
might get higher than she's capable of

1053
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:16,450
managing by herself but if I did stand

1054
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:17,950
there and she says mommy help me and I

1055
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,839
say to her I'm not gonna help you I'm

1056
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,399
gonna stand right here and you're gonna

1057
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,940
help yourself and if you're not ready

1058
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:30,400
and that's fine and that kind of puts it

1059
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:34,000
like in her and her own thing the other

1060
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:40,089
thing I try to do with my kids is I try

1061
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,640
to be honest with them my hope is that

1062
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:46,509
by being honest with them they'll trust

1063
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:50,200
me more and they'll do what I say it

1064
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:53,140
doesn't always work so I explained to my

1065
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,490
daughter the oven is hot the stove is

1066
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,200
hot

1067
00:57:53,490 --> 00:58:00,069
she actually has not had that particular

1068
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,470
issue yet which is great my husband

1069
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:03,970
rides a motorcycle he explains to my

1070
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:07,240
daughter after daddy gets off the

1071
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:08,529
motorcycle the motorcycle is hot we have

1072
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,519
some friends of hers over the other day

1073
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:11,019
and she says to them

1074
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,990
don't touch the motorcycle the

1075
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:16,118
motorcycle is hot and so for me it's

1076
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:20,500
like the difference between saying don't

1077
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:23,259
do that because I said so versus don't

1078
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:26,319
do that because here is a natural

1079
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:30,130
consequence we are at a time I would

1080
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:32,890
love to continue these conversations you

1081
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:35,680
can find me in all the social media

1082
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:37,868
places and I will just be hanging out

1083
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,700
I'd love I'd love to talk thank you so

1084
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:45,540
much

1085
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:45,540
[Applause]
