1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,719
thank you so much of doula good

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,940
afternoon

3
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:18,630
drink hope you had a good lunch yes

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:21,448
great and we all are not sleepy great

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,430
thanks for stopping today we are going

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,099
to talk about diversity and inclusion

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,680
which is not a gender gap

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,399
whenever I've heard that like diversity

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,190
and inclusion everyone thinks about

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:38,100
gender diversity everyone says it's just

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,339
a tiny gender diversity so here I am

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,200
talking about gender diversity apart

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,570
from that there are many more other

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:52,230
forms are there but if it's not a gender

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,870
issue is it a hiring problem because we

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,199
talked a lot about skill shortage in

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,390
cybersecurity or in general IT is it

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,789
about age problem because we have lot of

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,549
Millennials in cybersecurity or in

20
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,810
general and IT is it about ethnicity

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,750
problem or it's just about filling a

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,090
quota lot of people I have heard that we

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,479
have some wrecks open and we only want

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,290
to hire diversity diverse candidates who

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,740
are women trust me it's no good as a

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,020
women I don't like hearing that so if

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,780
it's not all of that what is it it's

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,060
actually not more there are many aspects

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,470
to it there are in diversity is actually

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,560
good for us when I say diversity is not

31
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,939
just about men and women what it is it's

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,180
actually in creating an inclusive

33
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,279
culture for all of us for all the people

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,670
who are there in the room if you look

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,079
around there are people from different

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,720
continents from different geographies

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,658
different age groups different

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,310
backgrounds I believe not all of us are

39
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,340
from the application security background

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,040
as Abdullah said that I had a training

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,390
yesterday with over 35 people both men

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,600
and women so in that training itself we

43
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,709
had people from shock

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,470
background which a security operation

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:19,640
center we had people from IOT background

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,580
they wanted to know more about

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,130
application security developers college

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,960
students talk about any any different

49
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,780
background and I saw that people were

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,940
there so before I had before I actually

51
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,480
deep dive into my talk I want to

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,859
introduce myself I am gonna

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,079
professionally or from my day job I work

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,330
with IBM India software labs as a

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,760
security architect wherein I heavily

56
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,310
worked work on dev psych ops and cloud

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,769
security apart from that I am very

58
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,370
passionate about giving back to the

59
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,050
community because I have received a lot

60
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,880
the states that I have got it's because

61
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,310
of the work that I've done for the

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,359
community or the work that actually I

63
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:08,690
have learned from the community about my

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,820
journey after college I got into my

65
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,820
first job which was not a security job

66
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:18,230
it was just a plain IT job I was working

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,970
as a developer after a year I was

68
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,640
actually given a project to work in

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,430
security it was kind of an accidental I

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
was actually no we're targeting security

71
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,370
but that's when I realized that this is

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,709
the place where I want to be in from the

73
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,050
shock from the suck analyst to shock

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,880
expert and SME in shock moving to

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,740
application security understanding how

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,590
application security works how the

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,700
architecture is moving on to cloud

78
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,550
security being a manager of a big team

79
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,339
handling the whole security from India

80
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,320
now I'm a security architect for for my

81
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,380
organization working on dev psych ops

82
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,930
and cloud security about my community

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,370
journey my journey never complete

84
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,250
without the community I started off with

85
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:11,330
null and awash in

86
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:13,400
ovas Bangalore null Bangalore and that's

87
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,370
where I actually stepped into first into

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,170
the community from there I was

89
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,370
introduced to enforcer girls which I

90
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:24,530
revived and now it's going on smooth

91
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,290
apart from that I am also part of a wash

92
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,619
Bangalore

93
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,950
now leading ovis bangalore co-lead for

94
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,530
ovis bangalore apart from that I'm also

95
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,330
part of OS women and AB sec through

96
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,789
which we do a lot of different

97
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,000
initiatives like we give free trainings

98
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,400
as I said that we give a free training

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,230
yesterday in DC and we are targeting

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,500
that we will be giving the similar kind

101
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,660
of sessions and maybe more on on cloud

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,930
security we def say cops or can be any

103
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,080
anything else but it's going to be free

104
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:02,060
of charge for anyone to attend apart

105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,090
from that I give talks and talks and

106
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,040
trainings at multiple OS conferences and

107
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,049
I was an assistant trainer at blackhat

108
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,320
this year which was a big opportunity

109
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:16,890
for me apart from that I was I was

110
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:21,270
speaker at Def Con apps like village I

111
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,340
also trained at Dianna Initiative apart

112
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,359
from that I got an opportunity to be at

113
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,460
besides LV where in one of the trainer

114
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,830
had issues and his flight got delayed

115
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,870
and he wanted me to support his training

116
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,260
so it was a big opportunity for me and

117
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,990
it was like an amazing journey and at

118
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,270
the hiker summer camp and on cherry or

119
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,800
cherry on top of a cake that I got to

120
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,710
receive an award from women cyber Jitsu

121
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,530
apart from this I we also run a

122
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,539
conference called OSC sides so I am one

123
00:05:52,530 --> 00:06:03,419
of the co-organizers for Awasthi side

124
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:06,480
and besides Delhi now moving back to the

125
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,940
topic when we say like we started off by

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,640
talking about inclusion diversity all

127
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,969
different things but how about knowing

128
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,340
about different forms differently abled

129
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,580
differently abled people the name itself

130
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,700
says people with different abilities

131
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,690
people who actually have power to

132
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,229
innovate and bring back so much to the

133
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:34,230
community to the organization's

134
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,370
ethnicity diverse ethnicity education

135
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,639
people from different educational

136
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,530
backgrounds culture

137
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,419
as I said we can see people from

138
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,900
different cultural backgrounds in the

139
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:51,060
room as we are at the absent conference

140
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:52,739
age neurodiversity now these are just

141
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,430
some of the forms that I've listed here

142
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,469
but there are many many forms so while I

143
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,379
was working on this topic I have been

144
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,900
trying to be very much involved in

145
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,389
diversity and inclusion but while I was

146
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,870
preparing for this talk I went through

147
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,210
so many articles and I got to know that

148
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,550
the information that we have is just

149
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,888
very limited and there are so many

150
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,289
aspects to it there are so many things

151
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,469
that we can work on then not just men

152
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:25,979
and women or just gender diversity being

153
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:27,750
a being of women I am saying that but I

154
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,240
have actually realized while I was

155
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:35,039
working on all these initiatives that we

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,889
have to do lot of work and I am NOT

157
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,370
including gender gap any which ways we

158
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:44,190
have to work on all of it together and

159
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,520
when we say it cybersecurity it's again

160
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,770
a big tent where and we have diversity

161
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,139
talk about shock we have people working

162
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,620
on incidents they are monitoring the

163
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,810
traffic we have IT admins network admins

164
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,400
and so many other people who are working

165
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,270
closely together so that the

166
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,870
organizations can be secure likewise

167
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:10,139
when we talk about applications we have

168
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:11,789
SDLC agile we have dev psych ops all of

169
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,039
it there are multiple people working

170
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,400
together development team security team

171
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,889
operations team think about if all of

172
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,948
them are not working together what will

173
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,659
happen the application will go down the

174
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,569
hatch that we have been hearing in the

175
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:33,120
past few years those are the major hacks

176
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:35,820
of the few actually 10 20 years so we

177
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,429
need to make sure we include it we

178
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,130
include all these forms when we say

179
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:45,260
diversity and inclusion not just gender

180
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:50,010
diversity hope everyone knows this man

181
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:52,620
right Stephen Hawking I am a big fan of

182
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:55,259
his work think about diversity

183
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,899
he's one of the greatest example of what

184
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:00,420
diversity can give back to the community

185
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:03,000
can give back to the society he's one of

186
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:08,250
the genius of his times he has given so

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,860
much so much to us but ten disability or

188
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,069
Ken something else stopped him

189
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,779
no everybody knows it at least in the

190
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:19,790
room I can assume that everybody knows

191
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,529
him right perfect

192
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,920
so this is one of the research from

193
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,449
Howard which is a pre-employment

194
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,269
research company they try and do

195
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,800
research around that who should be hired

196
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,930
who have been hired

197
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,560
what's the diversity gap what's the gap

198
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,839
in the industry all of it so if you look

199
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,589
at the first graph look look at the

200
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,199
beginning we had only males and then

201
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:48,420
suddenly we included gender diversity to

202
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:51,620
it we had a good decision-making power

203
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:55,410
but after that we included age to it

204
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,050
then we included age gender and

205
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,569
geographic diversity to it what happened

206
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,758
because the best of results this is not

207
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:05,310
me speaking I have got the stats from

208
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,649
the from Howard and you can actually

209
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,268
look up at the internet they have they

210
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,970
have been doing research from quite some

211
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:14,880
time now and we can see that if we have

212
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,800
people from diverse backgrounds from

213
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,649
different cultures from different

214
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,469
geographies it makes a whole lot of

215
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:26,310
difference and it makes a different

216
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:29,160
difference in giving your opinions as

217
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,258
well thinking about a problem resolving

218
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,969
that problem it makes a huge huge

219
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:38,490
difference now being of women who

220
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,860
supports lot of diverse issues diversity

221
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,889
issues and I'm a big champion of

222
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,769
diversity specifically gender diversity

223
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:49,259
but trust me it's the time to change the

224
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:52,079
dialogue it's the time to change the

225
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,750
narrative by just focusing on women in

226
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,399
or by just focusing of saying that women

227
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,009
and women insecurity women and there's

228
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,920
that we're actually dividing the

229
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:04,470
depleted workforce more this is not we

230
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,649
have to do when we say diversity and

231
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,749
inclusion we

232
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,889
have to include other forms of diversity

233
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:13,540
as well we have to include people who

234
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:17,199
actually do not know anything about

235
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,329
cybersecurity or even IP or who actually

236
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:21,490
want to come forward and say I want to

237
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,209
be part but I'm not I don't know where I

238
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,699
stand

239
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,609
can you help me so that's where we

240
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:30,339
actually need to help and there are a

241
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,699
lot of action items that we have to take

242
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:36,009
from this and before I actually move

243
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:39,399
ahead of the slides I have to say that

244
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:42,269
this talk is based on my views and

245
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,949
understanding of the topic this nowhere

246
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,559
relates to my employer or anyone else

247
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:49,628
and I really don't want to impose my

248
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,860
views on anyone but I want to share my

249
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:55,839
experience and view views that I have

250
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,929
got while working on this particular

251
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,540
area if you have any opinions any

252
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,550
information any feedback we can have a

253
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,149
discussion I would really love to work

254
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,758
with all of you and help you in getting

255
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:12,189
the diverse culture more I would really

256
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,309
be like to involve more and we have lot

257
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:19,709
of initiatives going we would like to be

258
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:24,459
involved and be involved with all of you

259
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:27,279
this is I love so when we say gender

260
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:30,309
diversity or gendered I our diversity is

261
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,459
never about bringing up gender diverse

262
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:36,160
issues and bringing down men I never

263
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:39,069
believed that it never makes sense to me

264
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,769
because I have got the best of mentors

265
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:44,709
from the community and they're mostly

266
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,870
men and women and people from different

267
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:50,439
age groups so I would never ever say

268
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,899
bring down men and bring up women I am

269
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:57,549
against that narrative altogether or I

270
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:59,379
am against that point or a dialogue the

271
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:03,369
main thing that we have to work on is

272
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:06,639
the preconceived notions like I've been

273
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:08,679
hearing from so somebody said that girls

274
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,920
can only play with the dolls and boys

275
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,980
can only play with robots dude there are

276
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,559
so many amazing women who are doing

277
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,760
exceptional in robotics one observer I

278
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,110
was raised

279
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,540
there's one women I came across

280
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,610
fearfully she's from Google Crouch ISM

281
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,819
doing actually exceptionally well

282
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:31,590
with robotics and same goes with men I

283
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,390
know friends who are amazing chef I

284
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:37,060
cannot cook that well that they're so

285
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,210
wonderful they're working for one of the

286
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:43,329
top class hotels think about that and

287
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,250
it's never about gender there are few

288
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,590
things which we actually need to work

289
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:52,480
upon based on the cultural issues but

290
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:54,850
still there is more to it now when we

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,910
say diversity it's never to take out

292
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,400
someone or existing groups but bringing

293
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,939
in more people but bringing more people

294
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,670
and more diversity into it my by

295
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,740
bringing more culture to it that's where

296
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,530
we actually work on that's when we

297
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,810
actually need to head on if we don't

298
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,600
care about that we're gonna be in big

299
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,839
big trouble I'll give you an example of

300
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,480
my friend when we were working on hiring

301
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,280
new people and our team it's one of the

302
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,300
case from my old organizations and my

303
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:31,360
old experiences so this person was from

304
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,000
a commerce background totally unrelated

305
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,470
to cybersecurity right commerce and

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,590
cybersecurity it's like two different

307
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:41,020
zones who thinks a commerce person can

308
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:46,450
be a good cybersecurity person it's just

309
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:49,150
an assumption right so but when we

310
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,010
looked into his profile and we started

311
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,380
chatting with him we got to know that

312
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,840
he's a really good security researcher

313
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,050
and a bug bounty hunter lot of holes

314
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,410
Hall of Fame's our claim to fame on his

315
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,780
name and trust me we actually hired him

316
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,850
we did not think about or we did not

317
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,150
gave a second thought he was in our team

318
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,680
but what happens next

319
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,709
he actually had a very hard time

320
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,599
switching jobs his application used to

321
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,750
get rejected in the first few screenings

322
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,820
itself like he filed a job he filled his

323
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,370
CV he shared his CDs with a lot of

324
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,100
people but guess what people were not

325
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,810
considering it why because he's from a

326
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,580
he's from a commerce background but not

327
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,579
from the cybersecurity

328
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,440
but right now as of today he's actually

329
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,589
heading he's one of the directors for

330
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,940
one of the very in renowned MNCs it

331
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,890
makes a huge difference

332
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,700
people actually looked into his

333
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,140
capabilities and now where he is

334
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,540
so I'm trying to give you all these

335
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,990
examples because I'm trying to give you

336
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,300
the perspective from different angles

337
00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:00,160
which is like for this case it's about

338
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:03,010
educational background so when this

339
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,829
another argument that I've been hearing

340
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,050
we are a merit-based system we're going

341
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,390
to be hiring only people who are in the

342
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,880
industry for so many years these many

343
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,800
years do have done this have done that

344
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,189
especially I'll give you an example

345
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,920
people say that I have a deaf psych ops

346
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,649
expert I need a tech devstack ops expert

347
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,209
in my team since when we started talking

348
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:29,040
about deaf say coughs like four five

349
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:31,709
years back and deaf sick DevOps is a no

350
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,599
was not actually in existence before

351
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:36,640
2007 or eight like nobody used to talk

352
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,899
about that everybody was working in

353
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,439
silos and nobody was actually

354
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:43,810
considering talking about all that now

355
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,700
you say that I need people with

356
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,890
experience of ten years in deaf say

357
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,110
coughs how can you get it we never

358
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,149
started talking about it when you never

359
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,430
started talking about it how can you get

360
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:55,120
the people in the room with that

361
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,760
experience

362
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,860
trust me it's very funny so we need to

363
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,770
ensure that first we are giving the

364
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,559
opportunities to the people then we can

365
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,449
actually judge whether this they are

366
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,300
deserved they are deserving candidates

367
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,339
or not another example that I would like

368
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,359
to highlight it's my personal example

369
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:23,079
wherein I saw that one of the team

370
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:26,339
around me had five opportunities or five

371
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,620
job or job requisitions open they said

372
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,320
we're going to be giving it away like we

373
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,780
want to hire people what happens next

374
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,149
there were 30 job applications or

375
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,760
thirties resumes submitted for that

376
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,880
particular for that but for those

377
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,310
particular job roles and guess what all

378
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,830
those 30

379
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,840
vacations from the similar circle

380
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,530
similar set of people from the similar

381
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,510
organization what happens next the

382
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,950
similar people will be hired we know

383
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,980
them we're going to be hiring them

384
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,830
that's about it but trust me it's going

385
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,040
to be hampering in hampering big time in

386
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,590
a long run I have a brick preacher or a

387
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,629
big supporter of merit-based system but

388
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,250
when we say merit-based system we need

389
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,190
to make sure that we have a room for

390
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,050
people to grow if we can't give room for

391
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,370
people to grow we can never say that we

392
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,010
are going to be only merit-based system

393
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,590
this implies only when when you actually

394
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,550
have trust in yourself and you can know

395
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,040
you know that you're going to be

396
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:30,270
supporting all those people training on

397
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,340
the job when you have a student can you

398
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,980
expect him to do cyber security job on

399
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,560
the very first day never ever I can

400
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,410
never expect now I believe that because

401
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,120
of bug bounties all the vulnerabilities

402
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,640
lot of buzz around cyber security you

403
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,229
might see people know about security or

404
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,990
the college students might know about

405
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,420
cyber security but from the first day I

406
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,090
never knew well I was growing up I never

407
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,580
knew cyber security was ever a career

408
00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:00,689
Here I am standing with a good

409
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,429
experience in cyber security you can't

410
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,470
say that I won't only go to be hiring

411
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:11,040
based on the merit you have to give

412
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:12,630
opportunities my favorite time so I'm

413
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,409
going to be talking about the land that

414
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:19,440
I come from India India has various

415
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:24,060
diverse cultures not just cultures

416
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,930
religions food habits climates think

417
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:30,629
about anything it's diverse every

418
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,180
hundred to two hundred kilometres food

419
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,240
habits change the way people dress up

420
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,180
change languages change like or 30 that

421
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:43,160
I know that there are languages not just

422
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,160
English in these so many other languages

423
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,750
so now let's talk about a little bit

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,820
more about when we say diverse culture

425
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,659
you might have heard about luck doc or

426
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,700
Kerala ISO last when I was here last

427
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:01,109
last month when I was here at the

428
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,499
airport San Francisco Airport

429
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:07,799
I saw a big holding of Kerala saying

430
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:12,779
welcome to India welcome to Kerala truly

431
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:15,359
India all of that so Ladakh is is in the

432
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,580
northern parts of India which is a cold

433
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,989
desert as it's part of the Himalayan

434
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:26,699
region and it's beautiful paradise

435
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:28,559
income on the contrary Kerala it has the

436
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,409
it's in the south and south western part

437
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,408
of India it has ocean on one side and

438
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:40,139
mountains on the other side it's

439
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:43,499
beautiful with the tropical climate now

440
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:45,719
if you see that when you go to East the

441
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:49,499
climate changes likewise when you go to

442
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,720
West it changes all together the same

443
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,639
way Mumbai and Bangalore are two

444
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,409
metropolitan cities where and Mumbai is

445
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:59,309
famous for its staple food water power

446
00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:02,609
and Bangalore is famous for its dosa

447
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:04,229
which is like salty pancakes and when I

448
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:07,678
was discussing about this talk somebody

449
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:12,059
said burrito like nice name I'm gonna

450
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,979
use that so and people cherish it when

451
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,349
they move from one state to another they

452
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:20,669
try and get accustom with the different

453
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:23,489
staple foods and try and enjoy it these

454
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,979
diversities actually created a diverse

455
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:29,429
culture or actually has led to the

456
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:32,009
evolution to a different culture the way

457
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:36,419
people dress up the way people eat the

458
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:39,450
way people think in general everything

459
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:42,359
there are lot of initiatives that are

460
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:45,779
happening from giving rights to the

461
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,439
transgenders giving opportunities to the

462
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,779
third gender

463
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,729
apart from that first day of period I

464
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,289
think it's gonna be it's gonna be

465
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:55,200
everywhere or I've heard that it's

466
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:57,389
globally the lot of organizations are

467
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,729
giving this particularly there there are

468
00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:02,998
who joins in Mumbai I know that that's

469
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:06,210
been run by mute people the day I was

470
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:07,710
there trust me it was super amazing they

471
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,100
cannot speak your

472
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,200
language our language birth they can

473
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,139
help you in the best way possible the

474
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,120
hospitality was wonderful that's one of

475
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,730
the diverse culture examples we still

476
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,639
have a long way to go but I just wanted

477
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:26,190
to share something about the diversity

478
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,070
and the country that I come from now

479
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:32,159
about my experiences and learnings I

480
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,649
have my fair share of experiences both

481
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,500
good and bad while I was working on the

482
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:40,830
interest in the industry and an IT or

483
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:45,059
cybersecurity my first step in the

484
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:48,720
community the day I was like it's just

485
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:50,730
at the random meet a random training I

486
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,600
was introduced to the null meats and

487
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,279
Hawass meats

488
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,350
somebody told me that I'm another

489
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,840
chapter leader for OS Bangalore you

490
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,879
should come to the meats I said wow that

491
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
there is some group that exists and talk

492
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,190
about the same language that I speak

493
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,580
wonderful I should go what happens next

494
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:10,380
I go the very next month because it's a

495
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:15,210
not monthly meet so the very next month

496
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:19,470
I go there and in the room of 20 people

497
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:22,980
and the only women nobody intimidated me

498
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,620
nobody said a word but I did not go to

499
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,990
the next couple of meets why because I

500
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,989
was feeling the odd one out nobody made

501
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:33,899
me feel but I was like I cannot go back

502
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,669
I am the only one what will they think I

503
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:38,969
don't know anything am i a stupid person

504
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:42,510
I don't know what to do but after a

505
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:45,090
couple of months I pulled myself up got

506
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,299
the courage and thought I'm gonna nail

507
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,850
it

508
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:51,110
I'm gonna be there because if I am not

509
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:54,600
there I'm never gonna learn I went there

510
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,639
got introduced to a lot of people got to

511
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,730
know about in for scigirls' revived it

512
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,309
and started talking with other people

513
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:05,220
and understanding that what's the issue

514
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,080
they're facing a lot of lot of people

515
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,450
said that they it's the same experience

516
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,299
they had and it's not just men and women

517
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:15,360
it was with students it was with people

518
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:17,399
who had experience of like 15 years 20

519
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,549
years they were very reluctant they were

520
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:21,090
saying this is the space for the

521
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:23,070
beginners

522
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,519
or for the Millennials or for the people

523
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:31,649
who are super glamorous it did not sound

524
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:34,950
right to me so as a leader I try to take

525
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:37,739
it up with other leaders and and I try

526
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,639
and create a space wherein we all are

527
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,590
feeling safe

528
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:43,590
we all are feeling that we have a sense

529
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,980
of belonging and that's how we try and

530
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:49,139
cherish the diversity in the group and

531
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,909
every month I can see that there are

532
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:53,490
close to hundred people that come to the

533
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,399
meet ranging from different backgrounds

534
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,590
different cultures different cities

535
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:00,178
anywhere what I've seen that if any of

536
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,549
the person even from the earth over

537
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,350
asked different chapters we have people

538
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:06,929
from different chapters from Houston

539
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,789
chapter from there was one more chapter

540
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:10,499
I don't remember but yes we had a lot of

541
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:14,009
people from different chapters San

542
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:16,379
Francisco chapter so all of us are

543
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:20,279
collaborating that's that's diversity

544
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:22,699
that's one form of diversity trust me

545
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:27,149
this kills them all this kills the most

546
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,789
I had everyone has certain biases which

547
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:32,008
people talk about some people don't talk

548
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:35,820
about now Here I am talking about my

549
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:39,809
biases while I was carrying I was

550
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:42,928
worrying about my career my job and so

551
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:45,090
many other things I had a lot of

552
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,610
questions creeping in my mind whether

553
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:51,330
I'll come back to work or not whether

554
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:54,649
I'll be Bernie or or after six months

555
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:58,259
I'll be relevant to the industry or not

556
00:25:54,649 --> 00:26:02,428
all those questions instead of enjoying

557
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:04,649
my maternity these questions actually

558
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:08,279
kills a lot the preconceived notion that

559
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:10,199
we have and it's not just me one of my

560
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,360
friend who wanted to go for sabbatical

561
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,869
because he wanted to take time off and

562
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,619
wanting to explore the Himalayans region

563
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:22,559
he just wanted to go away for some time

564
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:26,129
what happens in the rat race people tend

565
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:30,418
to forget what we want what we want to

566
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:33,029
do what we want in our life so when we

567
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,080
talk about preconceived notions we tend

568
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:36,510
to forget that

569
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,029
we have different people who talk about

570
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,140
it and who don't talk about it we just

571
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,450
need to help them out

572
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,080
they just need a listening ear and

573
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:51,659
that's why we community is your to help

574
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:54,840
them give them a pathway so as a stock

575
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:58,620
analyst as I said that my first job was

576
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,730
as a stock analyst and I was asked to

577
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,768
work in nightshifts so there are again

578
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,409
it's more of a preconceived notion we're

579
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:09,389
in a women might not want to work in

580
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:10,980
night shifts and trust me there are a

581
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:13,110
lot of women who who don't want to work

582
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,570
in night shifts but I was asked to work

583
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,539
in night shifts because the client that

584
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,789
I was working with all the leadership

585
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,980
was in us and I have to be there as an

586
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,830
SME to support them to make sure that

587
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,429
everything is up and running I had no

588
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:32,879
issues I was learning a lot I had I

589
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:34,710
might have not learned a lot when I used

590
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,240
to be in the nurse and like I might have

591
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,980
been in the morning shift but in the

592
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,600
night shift while working with them very

593
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,460
closely how servers work how

594
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,320
vulnerability assessment work all of

595
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:48,809
that I learned a lot and by this in my

596
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,668
organization I paved a path for other

597
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:52,350
women's to be part of the sock team and

598
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,250
they could also be in the night shift

599
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:58,980
which was very beneficial for me

600
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:01,620
now when I say making progress we are

601
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,139
actually making progress all the people

602
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,120
in the room are actually here to listen

603
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:10,740
to the stock in itself says that yes we

604
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,658
want to talk about diversity and

605
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,919
inclusion and we want to be part of it

606
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:20,399
in some way if not gender diversity but

607
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:24,809
we still have a long way to go and we

608
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,580
have a lot of good good items in our

609
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:29,220
bucket which we have done which we have

610
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,439
achieved see at the global apse a

611
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,659
conference itself we have people from

612
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,519
different age groups different ethnicity

613
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,590
I have been talking with people from

614
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:42,360
different groups so I can see yes there

615
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:45,899
are right do we have people from London

616
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,800
in the room yeah we do have do we have

617
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:51,239
people from Asia and the room

618
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:57,030
do we have people from America in the

619
00:28:51,240 --> 00:29:00,120
room yeah see we have we have people do

620
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,810
we have any students in the room yeah we

621
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:07,080
do have how about people who are just

622
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:10,440
getting started with the security do we

623
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:15,000
have yes we do have how about people who

624
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,340
have like 15 years of experience amazing

625
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,340
I'm not going to talk about age that's a

626
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:24,990
very tricky thing so I'm not gonna talk

627
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,060
about it so apart from that the most

628
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:31,380
blessing ones the issues the most

629
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:33,899
pressing issues beat cybersecurity or in

630
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,760
general I think they are not at all

631
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,100
related to technical details or

632
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,460
technical things people like project

633
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,419
managers people like sake analysts or

634
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:48,690
even the people who are working on just

635
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:51,480
the Excel sheets or report reading all

636
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,700
those people are actually required IT

637
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,530
admins network admins Linux admins we

638
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,140
know that means all of them are required

639
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,629
if we do not have people working

640
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,760
together from different different

641
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:07,800
sections we are not going to be

642
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:11,910
sustaining so how is diversity useful in

643
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:14,610
cybersecurity one of the thing that we

644
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,700
all need to we need to be very cautious

645
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,469
when we talk about that how should we

646
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,400
move forward what people should be

647
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:25,740
higher look at what you need what

648
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,770
experience you need not the gender not

649
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,540
the age group people with with two years

650
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,820
of experience might be able to do a

651
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,850
really amazing job but you're saying I

652
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,159
need only people with CIS wispy there's

653
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,929
that so many things you can't question

654
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,800
people on that look at their

655
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:47,280
capabilities and age is never a problem

656
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,250
trust me I have got mentors who like

657
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,520
50-plus and they have shared my career

658
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,710
in a big way I have had such good

659
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,860
experiences where and I have learned

660
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,690
from their experiences where it I don't

661
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,090
not had to bang my head against a

662
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,780
problem well in they have experienced

663
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:10,730
that and they could help me out

664
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:12,980
apart from that as I said cybersecurity

665
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,740
skill gap we have one hundred thousand

666
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,540
job open I make we have so many wrecks

667
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,450
open we have skill shortage we have

668
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,270
there's that but can you fill that by

669
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,690
just saying it I don't think so

670
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,360
we need people to fill those positions

671
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:32,179
how do you get those positions fill how

672
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,159
do you get to the those people you need

673
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,860
to support them you need to actually

674
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,440
embrace where and people are saying that

675
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:43,850
I want to be part of it help me out

676
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,600
right right perfect

677
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:49,790
apart from that group thing in is the

678
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,370
one that actually kills I'll give you an

679
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:55,129
example supposedly there are four people

680
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:58,340
who who have passed out from the same

681
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:01,010
College same professors same degree

682
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,629
everything is just saying fortunately

683
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,590
they get higher for the similar same

684
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,450
company XYZ what's gonna happen if they

685
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,209
face any problem they're gonna be

686
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,980
thinking almost similar

687
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,660
that's called group thinking we need to

688
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,200
make sure that we avoid that crap

689
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:21,320
thinking even to a problem they will be

690
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,150
approaching the frame way the similar

691
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,439
thoughts will come okay we're going to

692
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,669
be thinking this way we're going to be

693
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,730
doing that we're gonna be doing this

694
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:31,220
it's gonna be the same I have

695
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,929
experienced it with my peers with the

696
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,820
people whom I have actually done my

697
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:37,040
bachelor degree we all think the like

698
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:41,110
even sometimes we just need to do not

699
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:44,510
need to speak we just were talking eyes

700
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,159
even now with my team sometimes we just

701
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,860
don't utter a word if there is a

702
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,460
outbreak especially during the wanna cry

703
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:54,770
outbreak we looked at each other what we

704
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,299
need to do and those I spoke because we

705
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,750
know that we all are working in the same

706
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:03,530
thing day in and day out and most of the

707
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:07,520
time what happens with us we spend less

708
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:09,770
time at home but more in office right so

709
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,900
office peers are the best pals that we

710
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,360
have

711
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:18,610
so that's how you make a good bonding

712
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,110
with them however you need people who

713
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,620
can actually challenge the status

714
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:25,600
question who can say okay you have a

715
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,389
perspective but I have a perspective too

716
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,240
and sometimes it can be really

717
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,610
beneficial to where and there are four

718
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,140
people who are saying one thing but

719
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,760
there is another person who might have

720
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,530
something creative to say and the

721
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,680
problem can be solved in a better way or

722
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,420
can actually be addressed in a very

723
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,360
unique way

724
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,670
apart from that diversity also helps in

725
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,678
creative thinking not just creative

726
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:54,040
thinking it also gives you a different

727
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,590
perspective viewpoint or vintage points

728
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,200
and with there are those vintage points

729
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,570
we can actually look at multiple

730
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,840
perspective we do not need to look at

731
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,639
all the problems with a single lens we

732
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,699
need multiple perspective we need

733
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,490
multiple opinions to address all the

734
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,620
issues not just cybersecurity not just

735
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,850
diversity but any issue that you can

736
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,679
think of

737
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,520
think about the personal problems that

738
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,530
we have if you do not talk talk about

739
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,770
that with someone it is going to be I

740
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:28,720
have this and I cannot overcome by

741
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,790
talking with some people maybe your

742
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,100
parents maybe the people whom you know

743
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:35,739
your friends it's going to be resolved

744
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,339
right and problems these should be

745
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,949
resolved

746
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,350
rather it can be a big problem apart

747
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:45,428
from that we actually tend to get

748
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,960
creative ideas innovative ideas I have

749
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:50,370
seen that if you have multiple people

750
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,929
from different regions like Africa Asia

751
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,940
or America like all of the people

752
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,830
working together in a single room we

753
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,860
might have a beautiful product coming

754
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:02,410
out of the room beautiful inputs coming

755
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,260
out of the room and last but not the

756
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:08,950
least diversity cultivates diversity if

757
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:12,040
I can so this means that if I can do you

758
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:15,160
can do two and if you have people from

759
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:18,160
diverse group in a room the groom trust

760
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:21,279
me will be full of ideas I have a lot of

761
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,368
ideas but if I don't know with whom to

762
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,410
share it will never be sustaining

763
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,329
and when we talk about all the Peyton's

764
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,490
innovations how does that happen

765
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:31,410
somebody has to think about it somebody

766
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,328
has to talk about it and then share it

767
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:38,848
with the rest of the world that's how we

768
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:41,400
move forward so I have a son and when I

769
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:44,900
preach a lot about diversity I want to

770
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,329
make sure that my son have role models

771
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,099
not just one it could be many he can

772
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:51,680
actually look up the people who he can

773
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,509
actually look up to the people who

774
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,589
supports diversity and inclusion who

775
00:35:54,509 --> 00:36:00,630
respect other people other people ideas

776
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:03,089
viewpoints so when he grows up he can

777
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,460
think that yes there are people who

778
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,470
support each other who knows what to do

779
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,569
when to do and how to support other

780
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,149
people if we start looking down at the

781
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:14,940
people trust me this is not what I

782
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:18,390
really want and the similar way if we

783
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:21,450
have cybersecurity we need people who

784
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:23,490
respect each other who actually care for

785
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:27,689
the other person who give them the room

786
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:31,140
to the other person to grow so here we

787
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,450
are how do we move forward as an

788
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,578
organization we need to make sure we

789
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,618
embrace that I were starts that should

790
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,630
be the first and foremost opportunity

791
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,329
and it's not just gonna be a beneficial

792
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,950
for the organization it's not gonna be

793
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:47,099
beneficial for the diverse candidates

794
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:49,109
and trust me it's never a charity never

795
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,489
ever a charity it's going to be always

796
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:57,180
beneficial for our organization for our

797
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:59,220
for our maybe growth monetary benefits

798
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,529
because everyone talks about monetary

799
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,660
benefits diversity bring money with

800
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:08,220
monetary benefits there are stats around

801
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:10,170
it unconscious bias we have to make sure

802
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,450
that we don't have preconceived notions

803
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,680
for certain groups or people that I'm

804
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,118
not going to be hiring from this state

805
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm not gonna be hiring from this state

806
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,059
I'm not gonna be hiring from this

807
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,019
country I'm not going to be hiring from

808
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:24,480
this particular age group this is never

809
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:27,988
going to work out we need to make sure

810
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,239
we have an inclusive culture and apart

811
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:32,869
from that we are not enforcing our own

812
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,670
beliefs on the people we have around

813
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:36,580
they have their own viewpoint listen to

814
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,900
it

815
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,900
might be they have something better say

816
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,900
might be there there's something nicest

817
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,480
there I have got amazing outputs from

818
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,180
the room I have been talking with a lot

819
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,370
of people from past couple of days and

820
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:55,480
even on them I talked I have received a

821
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:56,950
lot of amazing output as an employee the

822
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,470
other employees we work for certain

823
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:02,200
organization sometimes we we all work

824
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:05,859
for ourselves right there are people who

825
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,990
are senior CEOs who are the start of

826
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:12,310
startup CEOs then the company the people

827
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:15,609
who run the company and what do we need

828
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:18,520
to do when we hire people they will have

829
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:21,490
certain backgrounds we need to actually

830
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,050
open up our mind we need to embrace them

831
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:26,140
we need to welcome them with an open

832
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,960
mind they might not be from the same

833
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,910
background they might not be from the

834
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,130
similar culture they might not be with

835
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:36,460
the same experience when that person

836
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:39,070
isn't the team if we help him if we can

837
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,950
give him a warm hug or if we give him a

838
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,770
warm path trust me that person is going

839
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:49,089
to be helping you out respecting you way

840
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:53,020
too much apart from that we all have

841
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:55,150
made mistakes and they all will now when

842
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,640
a new person joins in can we just

843
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,310
embrace him and say okay if you have

844
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,830
made a mistake it's completely okay it's

845
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,360
completely fine we will learn from our

846
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,850
mistakes and we are there to help you

847
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,470
out if you make a mistake or if you are

848
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,799
if you have any doubts just let us know

849
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:14,770
we will be there to help you out apart

850
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,470
from that the example that I gave about

851
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:20,800
hiring from the same similar set of

852
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:23,290
people if you have a group of people you

853
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,000
know and you've been working around or

854
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,009
if you know it from the community or

855
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,010
from anywhere else I'm not saying it's

856
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:32,920
bad it's good knowing their people and

857
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:35,650
getting them in the room it's good but

858
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,780
how about getting to know more people

859
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,940
you might make new friends you might get

860
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:44,230
better ideas you might create your own

861
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:47,410
another company right so making sure

862
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,960
that we actually help people outside of

863
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:53,520
our circle talk to them

864
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,830
and the conferences people come to learn

865
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,050
Network trust me the first day that I

866
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,549
entered into the meetups people say do

867
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,050
networking do networking without

868
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,450
networking you're never going to be

869
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,640
survive surviving in information

870
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:10,000
security or security in general that's

871
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,848
the best way to be be part and even

872
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,210
because of the community I'm here or the

873
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:19,869
work that I got to do people actually

874
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,910
gave me an opportunity so that I can I

875
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:27,070
can contribute back to the society or

876
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:29,520
the community apart from that how about

877
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:33,010
going to the different security groups

878
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,990
there are multiple groups would say I am

879
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,760
working on IT security I am working on

880
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,859

881
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,260

working on their own things how about

884
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,680
bringing all of that together so in the

885
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,140
afternoon itself I was talking with the

886
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,940
francisco and he was saying that he has

887
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:55,109
been trying to pull again pull together

888
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,400
multiple opportunities multiple

889
00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:00,430
organizations together so that we all

890
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,369
can talk the same language security it's

891
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,770
never deaf say cops south security

892
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:07,630
application security or sock security we

893
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,150
all have to talk the same language and

894
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,849
we all trust me even when we say

895
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:15,339
different diverse the sections of

896
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:17,980
security again we are embracing security

897
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,540
we are embracing diversity in it and we

898
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,599
are including people from diverse groups

899
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:25,180
I was a soccer analyst I was nowhere

900
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:27,940
into application security but people

901
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,379
helped me out and I'm talking about

902
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,800
application security and giving

903
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,690
trainings that's the fun part and people

904
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:40,089
are loving it

905
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:40,660
yeah I hope they are but yes as a hiring

906
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:42,940
manager

907
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,430
trust me this person has the most

908
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,770
amazing job and has the most

909
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:51,160
responsibility when cyber leaders say

910
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:53,500
that we do not have people who are from

911
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,598
diverse background how do we do it we

912
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,369
can't do anything we can't have hire

913
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,849
these people we can't do anything we

914
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:03,160
cannot move forward but trust me this

915
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:07,240
person can help retain the

916
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,009
balint diverse groups and can also look

917
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,439
for the people who are the best suited

918
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:15,430
for the organization it could be from a

919
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,650
commerce background could be from a

920
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,890
psychology background so I'll give you

921
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:23,110
an example here now I know a friend

922
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,629
who's a psychologist trust me

923
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:30,100
psychologists and cyber security who

924
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:31,900
thinks about that but he is so wonderful

925
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,339
and OSINT which is open source

926
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,180
intelligence because we've been talking

927
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:41,410
about that lately and that person is so

928
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:43,210
good in connecting the dots and who can

929
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,819
think that and psychologists will say

930
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,850
that I am really amazing in social

931
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,280
engineering and Osen and I can get you

932
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,960
what you're looking for and the most

933
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,150
importantly sometimes you even don't

934
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,040
know what you are who you are at the

935
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,740
social media and you can do the mind map

936
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,400
and give you the whole result and what

937
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:05,620
people think of you think about that

938
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,020
cyber lawyers are the criminal justice

939
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:10,990
lawyers they work day in and day out

940
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,210
with cyber criminals getting to know

941
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,879
what the criminals mentality is and

942
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:18,730
especially when we say cyber criminals

943
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,300
are the criminals who are taking out lot

944
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,060
of data money and they're harming the

945
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,400
countries especially in the case of

946
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,620
nation-state actors we need people who

947
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,590
think out of the box who can actually

948
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:35,470
map the threat intelligence who can who

949
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,420
can profile the threat actors and there

950
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,069
are not there's not just one group there

951
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,070
are hundreds of security groups or

952
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:44,920
hacker groups actually trying to harm

953
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:47,020
all of it and hackers are actually I

954
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,260
mean the malicious hackers hackers are

955
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,509
good we all are hackers right right

956
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,810
we all are hackers we are hacking our

957
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,190
own companies and trying to secure that

958
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,529
especially when we say apps a conference

959
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:02,170
yes as an application security engineer

960
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:06,130
I try and hack my own company and save

961
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:10,000
it so that nobody else can hack it apart

962
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,650
from that when we say hiring that can

963
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,040
also be done at the conference like this

964
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,830
and as we have diverse groups people

965
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,900
might want to hire

966
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:19,910
you and I remember there are boots out

967
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,790
there downstairs near the Lincoln rooms

968
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:25,609
that we have a lot of organizations

969
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:27,380
coming not just for the promotions but

970
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:30,200
they might want to hire you so you can

971
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,300
just go and meet them up you might get a

972
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:37,669
nice opportunity there a job opportunity

973
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:40,220
here as a community this talk never is

974
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:43,250
never ever complete without saying that

975
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,549
because of the community I am here trust

976
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,190
me

977
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:48,860
without that I can never move ahead I

978
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,200
could have never done what I am doing

979
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,240
right now with the people in this in

980
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,450
this room talk about Harold talk about

981
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,790
Lisa I talk about Kelly Mike so many

982
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:02,270
other people talk about Zoe and Tanya

983
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:06,259
so there are so many people who are my

984
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:08,360
role models so I've got so much and just

985
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,910
because of the community the only thing

986
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,640
that we have to be very careful that we

987
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,330
greet people and be with the people with

988
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,799
a warm heart

989
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:21,200
if there is no warmness we would never

990
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,810
be able to survive we need people who

991
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,370
can say that yes I'm there to support

992

just send me a text I might not be able

997
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,600
to answer it right away but I might be

998
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,970
able to answer it at a later point might

999
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:44,180
be a day later or whenever I have access

1000
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:45,529
to it apart from that from the

1001
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,089
communities what I have learned that

1002
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,210
there are so many opportunities so many

1003
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:52,400
scholarships score so many grants that

1004
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,050
have been given to the people we just

1005
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,130
need to reach out to people that how to

1006
00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:00,560
get in there that's about it and there

1007
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,300
are things which are already there which

1008
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,490
people might not know if you know about

1009
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,470
it please share it with people please

1010
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,120
share it further and it's going to be in

1011
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:10,069
turn helping them out and they're

1012
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,500
they're going to be always thanking you

1013
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:15,050
I always thank my mentors that's why

1014
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:18,290
whenever the community work comes in I

1015
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:22,160
always say I'm gonna be talking about

1016
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:24,920
the my mentors and the people so the key

1017
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,839
takeaways this is not the lifestyle but

1018
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,900
I'm just gonna be saying that when we

1019
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:33,220
say

1020
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:36,550
versity how about realizing that rather

1021
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:39,069
than just hiring people from or women

1022
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,530
from the top schools how about we hiring

1023
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:44,110
people from diverse backgrounds as I

1024
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,580
said psychology or sent people from

1025
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,640
development background operations

1026
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,799
background to application security

1027
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,240
rather than hiring the the brightness of

1028
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,000
Millennials how about giving an

1029
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,180
opportunity to the people who have good

1030
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,350
experience or who have more like when we

1031
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:06,310
say age the people who are from the

1032
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:08,710
Armed Forces or maybe who have been in

1033
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,350
the industry for a quite long time trust

1034
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:14,110
me they can strive more than anyone else

1035
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:15,819
can they have experienced anything and

1036
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:18,310
everything starting from when the

1037
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,660
computers were coming in now when we

1038
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:23,310
have like full-fledged everything

1039
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:26,740
running with hundred Mbps and whatnot

1040
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:27,549
apart from that we need to be

1041
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,830
collaborative

1042
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,720
not just the organization's everyone

1043
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:35,620
need to be very collaborative there are

1044
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,419
organizations which are open like women

1045
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,609
Economic Forum who asked women a

1046
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,290
knapsack in for scigirls' Busiek Grace

1047
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:44,320
Hopper so many wonderful organizations

1048
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,820
are there they're trying to help it's

1049
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,630
just that we need to be ready to take

1050
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,740
help from them there's no shame in that

1051
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:56,350
everybody should be able to take help

1052
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:58,629
from and diversity is actually big is

1053
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:01,299
being invited to the party and inclusion

1054
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,860
is being actually asked to dance we need

1055
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,120
to make sure that we are dancing when

1056
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,600
we're talking about diversity and

1057
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,759
inclusion

1058
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,040
every time we hire a diverse candidate

1059
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,560
we always make sure we enjoy that we

1060
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,290
have some nice balloons cake something's

1061
