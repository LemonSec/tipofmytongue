beautiful austin texas actually a tope

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
void in austin texas it's it's very

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
challenging to uh to give these

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
presentations uh remotely and so hats

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,359
off to matt because i got to watch his

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
presentation i really enjoyed it so so

sit and help make phds and master

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,719
students for quite some time too before

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,840
being talked back out of my academia

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
days by one of my former students to

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
become a chief scientist

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,239
of forcepoint and then cto of siren um

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
if you wanna

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
have uh a little bit more about me you

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
can you can visit my website and come

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,840

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
um and yes

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
i am the cto of praetorian now

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
praetorian is an austin-based cyber

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
security company but we're actually um

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
what we would call remote first

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
so we are

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
you know about half the company works

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
remotely around the us

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
and we have a large and thriving

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
consulting and services practice as well

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
as develop our security products and

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
what i'm going to talk to you today

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,040
about is

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
i'm going to link up the things that we

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
see in the services side with some of

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,759
the tools um that we make um praetorian

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,040
as a company is is really very good at

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,320
what we do

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520
um

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
and you know we we're lucky enough to

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
have among our customers for example

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
folks like twitter and zoom so we're

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
we're working with some really security

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
savvy customers

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,399
um and one of the things that we try and

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,239
do is work um well with the community so

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,720
one of the things that we have is a deep

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,040
commitment to open source so everything

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
i'm going to tell you about today is

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
basically free you can go and download

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,879
it from github you can play with it you

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,239
can tell me you love it you can tell me

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,360
you hate it

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
um so it's an opportunity to talk about

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
some of the things that we're doing in

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
the open source world as well as um one

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
of the products that we have that also

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
has a uh a free sign up

66
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
and you can read more about all of that

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
at pretoria

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
so so what are we going to do let's take

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
some lessons from the real world

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
um based on some pretty high-end

71
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
security assessments that our engineers

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
carry out

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
let's look at how we chose to respond to

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480
those because one thing that that

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
happens is you see the same thing again

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
and again and again right so you know

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
it's

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
it's one thing to say oh we have this

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
command injection well when you see it

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
for the 30th time you start to wonder is

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
there a way to automate this and as part

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,920
of our services practice we've got a lot

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
of tooling that we use in our

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,239
engagements and now we're starting to

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,440
open source on that and make that

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,519
available to community and then i want

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,200
to close with just a couple of thoughts

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
on what we as a community need to do or

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,239
could do to perhaps sort of raise all

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
the boats in the security world because

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,599
this really is a community your problems

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
are my problems um both figuratively and

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,799
literally literally right when you get

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
compromised because of supply chain that

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
can lead to a problem for me so we're

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
all very connected and so even from a

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
purely selfish standpoint

98
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,080
figuring out how to raise the overall

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,239
sort of health of the eq system is a

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
beautiful thing so i want to start with

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
a quick caveat

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
everything

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
there's a couple of examples that i want

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,439
to show

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,000
um the details have been significantly

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
changed because obviously we take client

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
confidentiality

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
very very seriously um

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
so

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
um these are real examples but i decided

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,799
not to show the actual source code

112
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
because it's it's too identifiable so we

113
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,840
talked through these things at a high

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,560
level um but yeah

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
all three of these things are things

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,399
that we see all the time

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
so let's start with

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
with something simple

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
and and when i sat down with our one of

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
our technical directors and services i

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,199
said peter

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,800
what should we be talking about you know

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,639
what if you had

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,880
five minutes with with customers and you

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
could just sit down over a cup of coffee

126
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
at a wasp what what would you want to

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
talk about he said well you know one of

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
the interesting things that comes up is

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,040
versioning because customers feel very

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
differently about

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
things that we see that are out of date

132
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
so

133
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
one of the things we find all the time

134
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
if we're doing netseq is oh

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
you have an edit version uh out-of-date

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
version of nginx or oh

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,479
you have a

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,880
vulnerable burden version of apache or

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,120
an app sack do we see old libraries

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
built into things that have cps attached

141
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
to them you betcha

142
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
um what do we see in corpse act you want

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
to guess yeah we see things that are out

144
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
of date we see it all the time but in

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
our practice we've observed two

146
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
interesting things

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
one

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
is that pretorians customers tend to be

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
pretty security sampling right they're

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
pretty high-end in the services world

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
i guess i should rephrase they're more

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
mature in their security journey i think

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,639
that's a fairer way to think about it

154
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,000
right they've invested in that over a

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
period of time and they're engaged with

156
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,280
the company like praetorians they're

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,199
looking for very high-end

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,639
services

159
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,960
so typically they don't have a lot of

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
things that are old or when they do

161
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,360
it's because they've looked at the

162
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
assessment and said yes this thing's

163
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
vulnerable but we're not calling the

164
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
vulnerable part of it so it's not

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
exploitable and i think one of the

166
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
challenges that we see when we look at

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,919
versioning is that there are two kinds

168
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,360
of there well there are really three

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
kinds of customer there's the customer

170
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
who they've got all this out of date

171
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
stuff and they're very vulnerable right

172
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,479
those are typically not the customers

173
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,919
we're dealing with but but they're out

174
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,759
there right if you scan

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,880
you know

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
you you see these things

177
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,199
there's a reason why some very old bits

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,960
of windows malware are still around it's

179
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
because those old versions of windows

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
are still around so

181
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
versions version versions

182
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
our customers are security savvy

183
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,400
but it doesn't mean they've patched

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
everything sometimes they're so

185
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
security-savvy they patch what matters

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
they're optimizing for throughput and

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
that's difficult so that when you look

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
at something just because we see

189
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
something is old nowaday doesn't mean

190
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,880
that it's a risk and and it's a problem

191
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,319
because when somebody assesses your

192
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,240
security remotely sometimes they're

193
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
gonna ding you uh like if you think

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,759
about supply chain security they might

195
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
scan our environment and even though

196
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,160
nothing's actually exploitable

197
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
um it can be a problem the other thing

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
is that generally even when we see

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
something that's that's slightly older

200
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
may be vulnerable we generally don't

201
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
take the time to craft a vulnerability

202
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,840
for it because those vulnerabilities can

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
be very finicky and what we've

204
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,960
experienced is when we show that to a

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,400
customer the customer goes yeah okay you

206
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,919
ran something from metasploit no it's

207
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
really not what we did

208
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
but um

209
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,240
you know

210
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
it's not the sort of thing that the

211
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
customer is typically looking for and

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
the problem with that is that's anything

213
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
but a virtuous cycle right so a virtuous

214
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,520
cycle is when you go around and round it

215
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
and everything keeps getting better

216
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
this is a sort of broken cycle and i

217
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,039
think it's partly broken because the

218
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,680
tools that we as a community have don't

219
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,400
work very well for developers if you run

220
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
black duck or depth scan a nice open

221
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
source

222
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,919
version of things

223
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
to over your code base there's a pretty

224
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,479
good chance you could be confronted with

225
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
i don't know maybe a thousand things

226
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
that um

227
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
are out of date but and that's

228
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,199
overwhelming

229
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,520
it's like as a as a pilot right i'll use

230
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
another pilot analogy later but one of

231
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
the things they train you about flying

232
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
at night they're like how do you crash

233
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,919
land at night at night rich your

234
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
engine's out you're going down what do i

235
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
do and your flight starts to say well

236
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
richard you you descend

237
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
that best possible glide you point at

238
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,759
something dark not something that's

239
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,440
like a street light

240
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
and when you get to 50 feet you turn

241
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
your landing light on and if you don't

242
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
like what you see you turn it off again

243
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
because you're going down either way um

244
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
sometimes when we run these scanners the

245
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
the results that we get are overwhelming

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,599
and that can be

247
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,759
that can basically lead to the i turned

248
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,280
on the light i don't like what i see i

249
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
turn it back off again

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
um

251
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,919
and i think from another pilot analogy

252
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,279
one of the things they teach you is

253
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
aviate

254
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,120
navigate communicate i.e fly the plane

255
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
first and foremost if you have any spare

256
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
cycles

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
know where you are if you have any spare

258
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
cycles left after that talk to people on

259
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
the radio it's about priority um and

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
we're not good at prioritizing things

261
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,880
software as rot is ultimately a terminal

262
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
disease and it will get you um but it

263
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
can take a while and so figuring out how

264
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
to break the cycle with customers is

265
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
really interesting right because i've

266
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
even i've got very good customers who

267
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,120
are very very smart saying it's not

268
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,279
helpful to know about certain things

269
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
because we've already assessed it and we

270
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
know it's not risky we have other

271
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,399
customers who have no idea that we're

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
running something called

273
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
so defenders we feel your pain

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
how to fix it i believe the way is

275
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,720
automation

276
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
and

277
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
making security more accessible so for

278
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
those very high-end customers they've

279
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
got their arms around this the customers

280
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
who are less mature on their security

281
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
journey

282
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,399
um you know one of the things that we

283
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
can do is we have a system called

284
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
chariot chariot has a free tier where

285
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,959
anybody can sign up and you can connect

286
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
it to your

287
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,040
um github or bitbucket or whatever your

288
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,480
source code manager

289
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,120
system is and it will do all these scans

290
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
for you and it will give you the results

291
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,399
we'll let you prioritize them that will

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
make recommendations

293
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
and you can sign up for it for free it's

294
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
built around a lot of open source

295
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
tooling because we really believe that

296
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
in the long term open source is is the

297
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,320
future for doing security right

298
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
and the idea is that it's designed to

299
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,360
help

300
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,519
make security more available for all in

301
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,640
a way that that is uh easy and

302
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
convenient to use and we made the

303
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
decision to create a version of it like

304
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
i said that's free so if you want to go

305
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
play with it and see what you've got you

306
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,200
can be up and running in about 10 clicks

307
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
at the more mature version of that in

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
the industry by the way one of the other

309
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,279
reasons we made chariot is if you do a

310
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
penetration test for this or a security

311
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,800
assessment it's much more than a

312
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,640
penetration test what you'll see is

313
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
yes you'll get a report but your primary

314
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
point of interaction will be through

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
chariot

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,519
it's crazy to me that you wait three

317
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
weeks and then you get a written report

318
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,240
that you cut and paste into jira

319
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
with chariot as we find weaknesses or

320
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
issues in your software stack in real

321
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,040
time we can load them up into chariot

322
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,399
for you to look at so you're seeing

323
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
results in real time as we find them and

324
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
put them up and then you can choose that

325
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,680
they're actionable and push them

326
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,279
straight into your jira with one touch

327
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
of a mouse and we think that's how pen

328
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
testing should be done it's all about

329
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
saving people time because we're short

330
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,040
of people and we're short of time those

331
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
are the things that challenge us

332
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,920
so let's look at a a much more technical

333
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
um

334
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,640
issue that we ran into and this one was

335
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,320
really unusual i've never seen a bug

336
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
quite like this

337
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
so you'll see at the bottom of this

338
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
slide that we have

339
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,360
there a wasp top 10 and i bet everyone

340
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,399
on the school can tell me what the

341
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
number one thing is it's broken access

342
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
control

343
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,279
and we see it a lot it's number one for

344
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,240
a reason a wasp you're very smart yes it

345
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
is the number one thing

346
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,279
and

347
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,760
a really funky cool example of this we

348
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
saw was a customer who had a

349
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
multi-tenant environment who was

350
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
allowing customers to basically run sql

351
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
queries against their stuff or sql line

352
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
queries they were doing custom queries

353
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,079
on

354
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,480
customer owned data and the validation

355
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,360
of is this query okay was based on query

356
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
passing so understanding that query

357
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
understanding what it does and then

358
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,639
making certain that it was querying

359
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,160
something safe

360
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
so you know if you think about the

361
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
simplest form of a query it's select

362
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
thing from place right or select thing

363
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
that matches some other thing

364
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,680
from place

365
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
and provided that i'm allowed to access

366
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
place

367
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,600
there's no problem so the query parser

368
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
would look at this look at the queries

369
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,200
that came in and say is you know am i

370
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,160
querying from the places the place that

371
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
i'm allowed to access does that match my

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,279
tenant id and the answer would be yes

373
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
the challenge with this is that you

374
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
could nest queries and if you tried hard

375
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
enough you could confuse the query plus

376
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,040
set about the nested queries and it

377
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
would see the outer query decide that

378
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
you had access to that data and what

379
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
they could be go through

380
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,839
so

381
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,680
on first glance this sounds like sql

382
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
injection right but it's actually not

383
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
because the whole point is you're

384
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,680
supposed to be able to take that

385
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
the root cause is in fact not correctly

386
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
looking at subject object action and any

387
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
time we do that that's usually broken

388
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
access control

389
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
the the trick is that as we increase the

390
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
distance between the enforcement point

391
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,399
and the policy

392
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,120
uh

393
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
point there's more and more room to go

394
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
wrong in this case the distance is

395
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,320
increased by the complexity that's

396
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
that's present in the query it was a

397
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,839
really interesting volume because the

398
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
underlying subquery was actually from a

399
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,279
different system um which was which is

400
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,040
fascinating it's one of the few problems

401
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
i've seen that work that way

402
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
what's interesting to me is how do we

403
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
find queries like this well automation's

404
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
really difficult for this kind of query

405
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,199
um

406
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
because

407
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
it looks like sql injection and in fact

408
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
when we built the tool to solve for this

409
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
kind of thing we found this as sql

410
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
injection and it's not

411
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,399
um but what we did realize is that

412
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,320
automation what we need are tools that

413
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
are really really quiet

414
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
that are developer friendly so

415
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,519
we built a go vulnerability scanner that

416
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,800
has a very very very quiet um set of

417
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
footprints right it's called goku it's

418
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
available on

419
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
github it has a pretty permissive

420
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
license so you know you can go and do

421
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,920
cool things with it to your heart's

422
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,959
content

423
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,839
and and the philosophy is when we see

424
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,760
these complex vulnerabilities the

425
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
realization is that you have to catch

426
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
the simple ones simply

427
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
but the current

428
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,199
crop of static analysis tools has a

429
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,440
really hard time with that because

430
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
they're not very low noise and again

431
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
just like running a dependency scanner

432
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,959
it doesn't work for a for an engineer if

433
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,120
they keep getting prs blocked you need

434
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,079
tools that are low noise easy to use

435
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
because we don't need more tools we need

436
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,000
to use the tools we have um

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
we've had a lot of good contraction with

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
go-kart and received a lot of good

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,279
feedback so

440
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
i would i would like you to if you can

441
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,199
if you're a go shop

442
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,880
go on to github

443
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
download it tell me what you think of it

444
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,480
we use it ourselves uh in-house and it's

445
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
it finds real things and it's very very

446
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
quiet so you know

447
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
how do you deal with those more complex

448
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
volumes the answer is you move the

449
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,639
burden for finding the simple volumes to

450
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,279
machines and leave humans to do the more

451
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,839
complex

452
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,880
another

453
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,279
theme that we see a lot

454
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,160
is

455
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,240
vulnerabilities that

456
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
come around because of new technology so

457
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
it's an old vulnerability brought back

458
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,079
to life because of new technology so

459
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,759
command injection is a pretty old

460
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,320
vulnerability we all know how it works

461
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,800
no rocket science but we found some

462
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
really interesting examples as people

463
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,680
adopt terraform of command injection via

464
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,199
terraform

465
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,160
which was fascinating right i generally

466
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
don't think of terraform as an

467
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,480
opportunity to command inject with user

468
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,360
painted data but in the real world we've

469
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,279
seen examples where that's exactly what

470
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,320
could happen

471
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,199
so

472
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,800
one of the challenges with these new

473
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,199
tools as they enter the deaf subcalf

474
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
loop is we're not necessarily aware of

475
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
what best practices are and we have to

476
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
learn on the job so this was a sort of

477
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
interesting case where

478
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,839
where

479
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,519
a customer was calling local exec

480
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,880
um

481
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,279
with some tainted data so what is local

482
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,160
exec so we'll go to the hashicorp docs

483
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
the local exec provisioner um

484
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
invokes a local executable

485
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
after a resource is created so we create

486
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
the resource we create um

487
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
an execution within it in the process

488
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,279
running um

489
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,320
terraform not on the resource and so

490
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
this can be

491
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,639
very very dangerous indeed right so

492
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,800
detect controlling the parameters the

493
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
exact code

494
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,839
in in the resource and this is classic

495
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,959
command injection via tainted input and

496
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,799
so the takeaway is as you bring new

497
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,039
tools into your tool chain

498
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
right the moral of the story is as we

499
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,919
bring these new tools in yes they're

500
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,199
incredibly good for helping our security

501
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
right i use terraform i love terraform i

502
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
love a lot of the hashicorp stuff it's

503
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,880
really cool it allows me to deploy

504
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,640
things in a more secure way

505
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
but i have to learn all about best

506
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,720
practices again

507
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,559
for a very complex tool chain and these

508
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,559
are all big tools right we're not

509
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,039
talking about small little tools we're

510
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,520
talking about very powerful power tools

511
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,080
and so understanding what best practices

512
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,440
uh is difficult and it's a very

513
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,559
difficult learning curve for your

514
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,480
developers because your developers are

515
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
typically on the hook to develop not to

516
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
be experts in security so when

517
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
technology is moving rapidly and the

518
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
places we have misconfigurations

519
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,679
continues to rise

520
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,640
i think we do the only thing that we we

521
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
can do to solve the problem and that's

522
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
we embrace automation so one of the

523
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,600
things that we do in praetorian is as we

524
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,320
see new technologies come out where we

525
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
see great power for improving security

526
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
but also the opportunity to create new

527
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
vulnerabilities

528
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
we

529
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,760
create tools and automation to let you

530
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
know if there's a problem

531
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
so i'd like to introduce you to our

532
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,960
newest open source tool again freely

533
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,600
available on github

534
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
on get with a fairly uh permissive

535
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,919
license um

536
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
it's called snow camp and snow camp is a

537
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,360
vulnerability scanner for sdl now sdo is

538
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,280
a service mesh and what i don't

539
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,799
i won't assume everybody knows

540
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,200
everything about service meshes because

541
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
not everybody's using them what a

542
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
service mesh allows us to do essentially

543
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
in a sas application that's micro

544
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,760
service based is it allows you to handle

545
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,200
all the wiring as infrastructure so we

546
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
can do things like engage in neutral tls

547
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,200
authentication between between nodes

548
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
trivially with istio you can

549
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
introduce policies they're very

550
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
fine-grained with istio so if somebody

551
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,919
penetrates one of your parts there's

552
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,600
only a limited number of places that

553
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
that part can get to

554
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
uh you can even do it up to an including

555
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,520
endpoints you can do a b testing very

556
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
easy for this geo it's a power tool i

557
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,919
love it service meshes are great

558
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,559
they really can help your security but

559
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,480
you can also misconfigure them right

560
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,919
there's a lot of best practices that are

561
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
not necessarily well known

562
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
so snow cam will look through your

563
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,760
configuration and they can either do

564
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
this dynamically or as a static analysis

565
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,960
tool and tell you about places that you

566
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,120
may have misconfigured

567
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,799
um your

568
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,080
your stuff

569
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
right

570
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
um

571
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,160
so it's it's pretty uh it's pretty

572
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
powerful

573
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
um you useful stuff and again

574
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,080
freely available on github you can

575
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
download it and start using it today at

576
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
no charge we're very pleased with the

577
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
tool

578
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
so

579
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
some closing

580
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,880
thoughts

581
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,559
first of all

582
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
how do we get out of security health

583
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
right security's really hard um i'd like

584
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,880
to tell you that the glass oh i have a

585
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
glass here and now i will take a sip of

586
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,600
it now it's in my own

587
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,720
the glass actually is half full

588
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,799
at the high end of the world um

589
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,559
the

590
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,960
security is getting better right our

591
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,520
best clients our most security mature

592
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,000
clients are putting up systems that are

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
really very very difficult to uh to beat

594
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
and to find weaknesses and they're doing

595
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
an amazing job and we're seeing

596
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,320
you know a hardening where where it is

597
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
it is uh pretty difficult

598
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
to uh

599
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
to get in we we still usually you know

600
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,799
we're like the bounties we usually get

601
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,690
our man but but it's a lot of work um

602
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,880
[Music]

603
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
so things are getting better but there's

604
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
a lot of stuff out there and so it's

605
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
still pretty easier to be an attacking

606
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,360
defender so

607
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,039
you know some there's some bright points

608
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,520
in the horizon what's common is common

609
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
do make certain you've dealt with the os

610
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
top ten it is not the only thing you

611
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
have to deal with but at least please if

612
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
you take one thing away deal with the

613
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,559
oauth top 10 automatically right use

614
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,039
automation to allow your people to do

615
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,520
the more esoteric manually and then i

616
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
would argue we don't need more tools we

617
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
need tools the way that work the way we

618
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,200
already work so here's my security

619
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
industry analogy let's say i made you a

620
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
six-fingered glove

621
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,280
you'd try it on you'd be like oh this

622
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
this doesn't fit rich the security

623
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,480
industry half the time would tell you to

624
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,039
grow another finger instead of going gee

625
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
maybe we could make gloves better that's

626
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,559
not true the entire industry right i'm

627
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,960
not tiring at all with the same brush

628
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,440
but there is sometimes a tendency for

629
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,799
security to think they have the answer

630
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,440
not listen to their customers enough

631
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,159
so

632
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,039
you know

633
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,760
as a community how do we solve for it

634
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,120
first thing expect more from your

635
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,480
vendors um you know you you're paying us

636
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
a lot of money uh you should expect a

637
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
lot you should get a lot and you should

638
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
get things that solve your real pain

639
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,520
um

640
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,960
but be reasonable about it right we're

641
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
human we're drowning in security too uh

642
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
but no really raise the bar and vote

643
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
with your pocketbooks

644
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,039
vote with your eyeballs vote with your

645
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,159
pocketbooks

646
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,960
you have tremendous power as a community

647
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
to move the needle to shape the

648
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
community for something better

649
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
and so tell us what you need but tell us

650
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,559
clearly and tell us repeatedly because

651
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,640
repetition is kind of sometimes how we

652
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,520
learn

653
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,919
and then lastly engage in open source

654
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
wherever you can i'm a huge believer in

655
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
the open source movement free and open

656
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,559
source software um and when you run into

657
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
shortfalls don't get mad about it

658
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
help us help be part of the solution

659
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
let's say you download goku and you go

660
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
oh rich this thing's getting things

661
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
wrong here open an issue and we'll deal

662
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,559
with it or better yet if you've got some

663
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,720
programming time you know and you want

664
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,080
to program something over the weekend

665
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
fix the issue an issue with pr and we'll

666
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,559
take it pick your favorite project and

667
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,320
give it some love because these open

668
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,600
source projects

669
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
can be transformative transformational

670
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
and better open source

671
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,919
will make the whole world better i truly

672
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
believe that so i'll leave this slide up

673
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
with some resources and then gene

674
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,440
i kind of kind of took a few extra

675
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
seconds there but i'm still amazed i got

676
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
through that many slides in that amount

677
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,120
of time so

678
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
what can what can i tell you what else

679
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
do you want to hear about
