2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,640
thank you fiona

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,440
and good morning everybody or afternoon

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,200
evening night wherever people are

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,440
joining from in this virtual days

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,559
um

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,199
i am karthik i'm the cto at interspace

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,640
like leona said

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,199
we make salisha we we provide a solution

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
that makes it extremely easy to secure

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
your web applications and apis

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,599
and today i'm going to be talking about

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,080
an application security playbook uh this

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,519
is something that is gleaned like what

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,399
is a playbook a playbook is basically a

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
set of best practices um that

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,000
in in our case we've actually come up

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,079
with after you know

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,719
years of working uh working securing web

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,920
applications

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
so we just want to highlight i just want

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
to highlight some

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,960
uh some of the some of the things we've

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,039
learned over time and these are the kind

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,480
of things that

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
any application should do to um to

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,399
actually

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,960
be secure

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
let's see if this works

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,559
cool

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,519
so

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
let me first talk about you know the key

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,600
trends in the application and what's

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
leading to that explosion

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
so one trend definitely is there's a

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
trend uh towards digitization now this

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
is not a new trend

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
this has been happening for a while now

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,600
but

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
the last two years of the pandemic have

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
definitely accelerated this trend even

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,439
more so

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
um businesses that would not probably

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,320
have considered digitizing

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
you know were almost forced to do it

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,799
for survival or to service their

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
customers effectively or what have you

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,799
so right now any business is probably

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,320
either digitizing or thinking about

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,439
digitizing really soon

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,600
um partly because of this again a trend

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
that's been happening for a while but

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,399
again uh it's it's also feeding off this

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,360
of the last two years uh more more

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
application or more business is

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
digitizing another trend that is

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
actually um that's that's helping here

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
is cloud computing

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
this makes things faster it's not just

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
price actually it's the ease of

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,920
deployment it's it's it's how easy it is

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
to spin up i spin up services and um and

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
machines and

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,319
all the infrastructure that goes along

65
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,879
with actually digitizing your business

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
has become very much easier because of

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
cloud computing

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
there is price also but that probably

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
wasn't the primary driving factor it's

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,560
more the ease of business that that

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
drove that

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,160
and the third trend around this is

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,959
aggregated services and open api

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,760
um like there is open api for banking if

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
you're in fintech there's open apis and

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
aggregated services for so many things

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
right from identity and management to

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,920
live chat and everything so this means

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
that the business

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
can actually focus on their core

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,879
business or

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,680
mostly the core business and

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
use services built by somebody else to

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
do certain things that that that is

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
needed to have the business running but

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
it's not really their core competency so

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
these three things together has actually

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
the trends are continuing of course

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
there's aps for everything and this is

90
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
actually leading to more and more

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
applications being developed

92
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,599
quickly um

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
for this audience i probably won't go

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
into what is application security i

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,560
think everybody knows what's application

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
security

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
here the only thing that i'm going to

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,720
actually focus on is is the bullet point

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,239
a little bit below which is the concept

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,319
of shared responsibility and the reason

101
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,360
i'm going to talk a little bit about

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
this is that i have actually heard from

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
some people that hey i am on the cloud

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
and they are secure so why do i need to

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,400
care

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,440
and um that's that's that's true to a

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
point which is that uh which is why

108
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
public uh cloud vendors um actually talk

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
about the concept of uh shared

110
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,599
responsibility aws in fact has a whole

111
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,640
um

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
in a document about this uh this shared

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,760
responsibility so the cloud vendor is

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,319
responsible for the infrastructure

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
which means any infrastructure level

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,599
attacks and vulnerabilities they will

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,080
take care of it so uh if you're talking

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
about you know thin flood or tcp level

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,239
attacks these are things that the cloud

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,639
vendor will uh will happily you know

121
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
block absorb without an issue kind of

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
stuff

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
but

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,680
the applications hosted on the cloud

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
is actually your responsibility

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,040
and uh just like bugs in the code uh

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
fixing is your responsibility security

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,199
of that of the application at the

129
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,960
application layer

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
is definitely the business

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,759
responsibility

132
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
so this is why we need to talk about

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
application security and uh and you know

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,040
businesses need to need to take

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
application securities seriously

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
okay let me let's look at the challenges

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
why is it difficult to actually secure

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
applications

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
firstly there is many moving parts now

140
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
this is actually part of the part of the

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
trends that we talked about earlier

142
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
many moving parts is because there's

143
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,479
multiple third-party

144
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,560
services and apis that you may be

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,919
integrating with

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
um even if you're not even for building

147
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
everything in-house or a vast portion of

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
your of your

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
components in-house there will be

150
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,639
multiple services multiple

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
micro services and components

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
potentially by different teams and

153
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,880
definitely with different deployment

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
timelines and development cycles so it

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
is complex you know most likely you're

156
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
using more than one technology within

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
your within your application so this is

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,639
uh this is this is definitely what makes

159
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
it more complicated here

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,560
the other uh another uh factor here is

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
that security is a speciality

162
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
it's not you might have a top-notch

163
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
engineering team but that doesn't mean

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,960
that they're security experts it's not

165
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
it's not

166
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
it's not just smart engineers security

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
is a speciality

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
and

169
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,840
the

170
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,039
of course well you know well while

171
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
people can be trained and people can

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
learn this stuff

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
the problem for most organizations that

174
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
are not already you know well already

175
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
have a big security uh team

176
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
is that um there's not a lot of time to

177
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,199
train um

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
train security experts

179
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
the attacks are not happening six months

180
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
from now and a year from now the attacks

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
are happening now you need to be already

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120
on your toes to block it now

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
and

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
the threat is real this is not we're not

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
talking about uh you know

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
that oh you know i'm too small why would

187
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,039
they come after me or i work in this

188
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,639
particular type of business you know i'm

189
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,240
not really a target for attack i'm not a

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
bank it doesn't work like that almost

191
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,680
anything any application that is

192
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
on the internet will will and is a

193
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
target will be or is a target

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
for attacks

195
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
we did this exercise some time back i

196
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,759
think um where you know we put an

197
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
application up and it is minutes before

198
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
it's attacked things are discovered

199
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,599
their bots discovering and attacking

200
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,759
very very quickly

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,000
and the last thing is that

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
uh you know ddos uh is also a very very

203
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
uh we we see this attack a lot

204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
and in many cases it's it's also uh you

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,919
know uh kind of for money you know it is

206
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
obviously nation states and other things

207
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
which which go after uh certain uh

208
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
certain sites but it's also for money

209
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,319
which is uh more or less like you know

210
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
blackmail or ransom which is that you

211
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
know either you pay us or else we're

212
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
going to launch an attack and bring down

213
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
and make your site unavailable just

214
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
before a key date or something like that

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,240
so these these this is what we're seeing

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
happening in application security and

217
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,919
why it is uh you know a little

218
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,560
challenging for people to

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
offer businesses to actually uh this

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
thing you know secured

221
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960
all right so let me give you a very very

222
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,759
high level playbook from what we see of

223
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
how things are happening

224
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
um

225
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,639
so number one thing is you know first of

226
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,160
all you know take control of what what

227
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
you can do and what you can do is know

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
your applications

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,479
list down

230
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,319
your applications all your public facing

231
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,319
applications list on the components

232
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
they're using the services they're using

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
whether internal or external

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
just this exercise provides a lot of

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
value and you'll you'll you will realize

236
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
things that hey you know like what about

237
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,120
this api who's securing it and things

238
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
like that so this is a very key part it

239
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
sounds simple but this is this is this

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,159
is a definite first step towards doing

241
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,839
it like this is discovery know what you

242
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,399
have

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
once you know what you have the next

244
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
step is to do a security assessment on

245
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,760
it you need to find out okay i know

246
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
these are applications and these are the

247
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
services and apis that i'm that i'm

248
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
exposing

249
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
where is my risk within these

250
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
applications

251
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
and how do i protect against it so these

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
this is this is this is part of it that

253
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
that you have to do the very next step

254
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,399
right which is that

255
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
figure out where your risk is figure out

256
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,600
um

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,279
you know where to prioritize your

258
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
protection or mitigating controls and

259
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
things like that

260
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
now again uh talking about security and

261
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
expertise

262
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
this is where you will partner with

263
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
security vendors or system integrators

264
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
and and people like that

265
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
but what you want to look uh look at is

266
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
is vendors that

267
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
provide a managed service or provide

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
some management to what they sell you

269
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
as opposed to just giving a tool and

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
then um yeah

271
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,519
and then

272
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
you know supporting the tool that is if

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
you find the thing that hey i don't know

274
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
how to run it they'll tell you how to

275
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
run it but the security decisions and

276
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,320
discussions and understanding is all

277
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,519
your own

278
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,839
this is not going to work out as well

279
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,800
just giving you a list of

280
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
vulnerabilities just telling you hey you

281
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
can turn on whatever protection you want

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,120
we don't believe that's a great uh great

283
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
great strategy once again because of the

284
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,240
security expertise question

285
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
so partner with vendors who who can give

286
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
you uh who can manage your

287
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
vulnerabilities and your protection as

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
well

289
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
these things are talking about tools and

290
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,720
solutions

291
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
but the the next point i'm talking about

292
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,519
is more a culture

293
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,560
this is the transparency right the what

294
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
what we've seen or what everybody's seen

295
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
over the last uh you know years of

296
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,279
breaches with the best of best of uh

297
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
intent whatever best of uh care taken

298
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
they are breaches sometimes and when

299
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
that happens what affects a business's

300
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
brand value or what affects um

301
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
uh you know how how the company does

302
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
going ahead how the customers react to

303
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
it is often transparency it's it's do we

304
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,959
trust this company that they're trying

305
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,399
to do the right thing have they done the

306
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,839
right things and still things happen and

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
how have they uh now i trust them to

308
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
actually fix those holes and and take

309
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,600
better care in the future so

310
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
transparency is very very key uh to

311
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
building trust so that people realize

312
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
that you're not trying to hide other

313
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
breaches or other things or other

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,000
vulnerabilities in the in your

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,079
application

316
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,600
and finally um what about what when the

317
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,959
you know look at continuous risk

318
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,480
detection

319
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
this is not security assessments it's

320
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,000
not a one-time thing and then you you

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
build it or you know once in six month

322
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,480
thing it is continuous uh continuous can

323
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
of course mean different things

324
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
you know automated scans can run much

325
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
much more frequently and then there's a

326
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
manual pen testing which is also

327
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
necessary but that

328
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360
may be at a different time time frame

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
but still periodic

330
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,200
and you have to have a web application

331
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
firewall which will which will block

332
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
your uh you know which will safeguard

333
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
your applications in a mitigating

334
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,440
control as well as save your apis

335
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
so these are the five things though the

336
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,880
five most key things we think

337
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,959
are important to your application

338
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
security uh playbook

339
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
okay this is looking at the same thing

340
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
just putting it down in into a into a

341
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
into a you know a bulleted list kind of

342
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
format so that it's easy to look at what

343
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
to execute and how to execute it

344
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
so just like we said discovery so this

345
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,519
means getting an inventory of of of your

346
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,200
own and other other services you

347
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,959
integrate with

348
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,800
do the security

349
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,959
assessments so you find out what is your

350
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
risk posture what is most at risk

351
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
add the mitigating control with your web

352
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
application firewall

353
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
and

354
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,200
make sure that your vendor your oem

355
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
provides you a proper solution we

356
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
believe solutions make more uh make have

357
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
have a better impact or make more sense

358
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,639
for um for businesses

359
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,920
than just tools of aem oe um tools or

360
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,160
oem just giving you a bunch of tools

361
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
even if they have a common portal or

362
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,040
something

363
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
you need you need somebody who

364
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
understands security which will look at

365
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,000
the risk and put the appropriate

366
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
mitigating control while making sure it

367
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,839
doesn't affect your business so you know

368
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
this kind of balance and stuff has to be

369
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
done continuously

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
all these have to be done not just for

371
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
your applications also has to be done

372
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
for services

373
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,800
partners apis that you integrate with

374
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,440
and given all that the other other big

375
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,519
thing that that uh that a solution

376
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,160
should offer is simple reporting to all

377
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
the stakeholders this actually goes a

378
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
long way towards building that trust

379
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,760
thing you know internal confidence as

380
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
well as if

381
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,839
and you know

382
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,920
a breach of some sort happens

383
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
it will be

384
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
a much better way of being transparent

385
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,959
and

386
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
reacting to it faster mitigating it

387
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
faster and also

388
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,440
explaining to her to to customers that

389
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
hey these are the steps we've taken

390
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,720
before in spite of this this happened

391
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,839
and this is what we're going to do in

392
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
the future this kind of conversation

393
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
will become much quicker once you have

394
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
these things in place

395
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,639
so this reporting is also very important

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
okay so what are the desired outcomes

397
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
from from an application security you

398
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,240
know policy or uh mindset

399
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
so of course there's there's there

400
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
there's the obvious ones which is you

401
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
know i want to safeguard my application

402
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
i want to make sure that attackers do

403
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
not impact my business and yes you will

404
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
get all that of course that that is that

405
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
is part of why you're doing this but if

406
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
you look at it and put on the business

407
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,880
hat you know not just the uh not just

408
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
the security hat there there are higher

409
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
level uh reasons or business reasons uh

410
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
why you should do this as well

411
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
one it enables faster digitization

412
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
once you know you're secure you can

413
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
actually

414
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
uh move faster you can actually be more

415
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
attractive

416
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,959
um

417
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,360
the the development deployment the

418
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
engineering team also gets more agile

419
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
because they can leave security to

420
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,399
experts uh of course you know i'm not

421
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
saying don't fix the security bugs do

422
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,760
that but you have you know security

423
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
experts looking uh at it as well as uh

424
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
you know adding mitigating controls and

425
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,839
protection um you know at other places

426
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
so you can focus on your core business

427
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
cases and solving your business use

428
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
cases

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
this actually develops moves to an

430
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,079
extended cohesive ecosystem and this

431
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,000
means not just the ecosystem of

432
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
integrating with third-party libraries

433
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
and services this also means that all

434
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,480
your internal services teams as well as

435
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,839
your

436
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,600
you know extended

437
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,199
ecosystem

438
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,800
all talk the same language in terms of

439
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
security you all understand what the

440
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
risk is how the risk is being talked

441
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
about in a similar

442
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
vocabulary and that actually helps

443
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,440
all this means you can build delightful

444
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,279
customer experience built on trust built

445
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
on a bedrock of security which leads to

446
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
a high business growth so this is the

447
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
actual design outcome along the way not

448
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
just okay i'm preventing it from getting

449
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
attacked

450
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
so okay here's a slide where we talk

451
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,839
about a little plug for aptrana which is

452
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
our our technology which is the fully

453
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,920
managed web application security

454
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
solution like i said we believe in

455
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,079
solutions and not in just tools

456
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,959
and

457
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,519
here we have a managed wish detection

458
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,759
management protection managed risk

459
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
monitoring

460
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
and because security

461
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,959
you know we also want to make sure the

462
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
application is fast and provide speed we

463
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,839
also provide a cdn so you get site

464
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
acceleration as well

465
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,959
and

466
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
um this is the whole thing is that's why

467
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,839
our main thing that we say is that this

468
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,079
enables businesses to go digital

469
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,519
fearlessly i mean people are going

470
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
digital anywhere anyway

471
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,000
but this allows you to go fearlessly

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
with a smile on your face kind of stuff

473
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,480
and the next thing is that we do we do

474
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
have a combination of technology and

475
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,839
human intelligence and uh

476
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,120
the

477
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
this is this is important right there is

478
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,320
technology there is there is machines

479
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
making decisions and and fast and all

480
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
the stuff but

481
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
there are times when we do need to pull

482
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,679
in humans and a managed service has that

483
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
advantage so in fact this there's an

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
actual uh

485
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
example that happened sometime back

486
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,959
which is um there's a customer who came

487
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
to us uh because they were under the

488
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
house the high level of ddos and they

489
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,599
had um you know actually tried two other

490
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
vendors before they came to us and as

491
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
soon as they routed traffic was of

492
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
course we started clipping the ddos and

493
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
and blocking the bad traffic

494
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,000
but the botnet um does adjust and you

495
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
know it was it was adapting a little bit

496
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
so we pulled in the humans automatically

497
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
and uh when they looked at it they could

498
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
give a targeted rule

499
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,559
and literally cut the thing completely

500
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,240
you know at its feet

501
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
so this kind of stuff and so this kind

502
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
of stuff that we can do

503
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
is that that's why we say we need a

504
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,960
combination of technology and human

505
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
intelligence to get the biggest amount

506
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,919
of protection that you can

507
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,919
all right

508
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,080

533
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
applications are crucial to the business

534
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
especially now with the digitization

535
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,919
improving or increasing so much

536
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,080
applications are the responsibility of

537
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
the business not the infrastructure of

538
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
the cloud so security of the application

539
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
also the responsibility lies with the

540
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
business

541
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,720

542
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559

mitigate these are i mean obviously you

544
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,919
have to mitigate risk but also think

545
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,240
about security solutions as building

546
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
trust

547
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,799
