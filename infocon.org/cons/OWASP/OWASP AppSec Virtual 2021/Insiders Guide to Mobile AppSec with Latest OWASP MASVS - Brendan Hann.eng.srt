00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,680
all right so jumping into it hey

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,400
everyone uh my name is brendan hahn

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
uh and welcome to the insider's guide to

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,759
mobile appsec with the latest owasp

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,880
standard

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,119
or m-a-s-v-s

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,600
uh a little bit about me before we jump

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
into it uh my name is brendan han like i

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
said i'm the product marketing manager

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
at now secure

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,280
uh and i have experience in web and

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
mobile appsec with a focus on helping

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
organizations deliver innovative secure

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
applications at scale

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
using devsecops uh at the end of the day

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
i'm a security enthusiast with a passion

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
for development velocity uh and at now

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,079
secure we're on a mission to save the

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
world from unsafe mobile apps which is

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
why i'm here today to talk to you about

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,879
the ms m-a-s-v-s

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,800
so

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,920
the mis-vs uh is important because

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
mobile uh apps are driving innovation

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
across industries right so between

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,280
uh you know all-state doing things like

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
accident claims arvr shopping delivery

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,760
innovations and more mobile apps are

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
delivering new experiences

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
and the challenge that comes with that

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
is unpredictable security blockers

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
so what's going to block your next

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,400
release

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,560
for mobile apps both google and apple

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
have created app store requirements uh

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,240
that can actually block you from

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
uploading your app to

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
the google play and apple app stores

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
respectively uh internal security

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,799
testing and governance requirements and

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
governance requirements can both block

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,320
your release

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
um

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
and that assumes that it's actually a

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
completed application that it's ready

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
for release uh if your features haven't

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
been fully built or you have bugs that

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,439
you need to fix both of those can

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,000
delay your release as well so

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
it might be all of the above

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
um

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
so we've talked about how mobile apps

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,840
present unique challenges uh and there

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
are some really scary statistics that

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,959
come with that fact uh

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
even though mobile now accounts for

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
almost 70 percent of web traffic uh and

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,480
there was a 90 spike of mobile apps load

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
downloaded to the pin due to the

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
pandemic uh 85 percent of mobile apps

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
failed to pass the oauth mobile top 10

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
uh and 70 percent of mobile apps

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
personally uh identifiable information

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,160
uh that could i violate gdpr or ccpa

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
to further drive this point home uh if

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
this was a

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,120
room full of people i would ask you to

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
raise your hand uh who uses any and or

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,959
all of the apps uh on the screen right

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,560
now

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
uh most people

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
uh use some if not all of them uh but

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,599
what's scary

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,560
is

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,440
there's very real risk

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
with these apps so

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
um

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,599
all of the apps in the yellow square uh

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,680
have known breaches within the past

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
couple of years

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,640
to learn more

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
um you can

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
check out some of the free resources

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
that now secure has built uh included

87
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
the mo including the mobile risk tracker

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
which shows prevalent mobile app risks

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
by vertical uh and the breach tracker

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
which shows the most up-to-date list of

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
breaches so

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
um we've talked about how scary this

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
problem is

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
and part of it is that there are very

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,959
unique challenges

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,319
uh to

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
mobile

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
appsec and app development so there are

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
two different mobile operating systems

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
to consider whether you're building for

101
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
ios or android

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,239
you have to think about the different

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,959
languages frameworks libraries

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,360
there are constant updates unprotected

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
devices

106
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,239
and at the end of the day in order to

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,840
handle these

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
testing requires physical devices

109
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,159
which makes it harder to test

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
and

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,360
there's sophisticated automation that's

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
needed

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
but the good news is you can rely on the

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
owasp mma svs as a way to teach

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
developers what they need to know about

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
security and teach security about what

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
they need to test for

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,360
so the mobile attack surface is broad

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
uh attackers can take advantage of the

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
app itself

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
the hardware it's installed on

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
the network and cloud services it

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
utilizes

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
the data center in the app and app back

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,720
end that it actually relies on all of

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
these are potential avenues for

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,320
data leakage and attacking

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
um so there are actually five big areas

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
that attackers can take advantage of

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
uh there's the actual code that

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,600
developers write that is then uh that

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
whole code functionality box uh there's

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,240
data at rest

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
uh both of those exist on the physical

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
phone itself but once the app is running

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
you open a whole new can of worms right

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,919
so once the app is running attackers can

138
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
also look to capture data in motion from

139
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,520
insecure data transportation protocols

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
or abuse api backends to get the user

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,960
data

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
that's in your application

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,759
so

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,680
it's a very scary problem how do we

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
solve that

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,520
one of the first steps that now secure

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
recommends is reducing your actual

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,800
attack surface

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
so

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
you should be looking to write secure

151
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,479
code from the start protect data in rest

152
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,919
and in motion

153
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
and inspect your api back ends to get

154
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
visibility into potential insecurities

155
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,759
and we're going to talk more about

156
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,240
what mobile app security testing

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
actually entails now

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
and the misvs right so

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
clearly

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
mobile app security testing is a loaded

161
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
term uh in if we start in the middle app

162
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,360
security starts with understanding

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
security requirements of course this is

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
where awesome people like the people of

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,840
the o wasp uh have created the mas vs

166
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,520
the ms tg the mobile top 10 uh and some

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919
checklists so that you can understand

168
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,800
what

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,039
threats you really need to

170
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
address in your application

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
if we then look to the left uh mobile

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
has its own really fun unique set of

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,960
challenges that we've already talked a

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
little bit about

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
like your operating system coding

176
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
language the device that's being run on

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
and more

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,039
uh and then to the right if we think you

179
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,479
know mobile app

180
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,680
security

181
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
testing if we think about that testing

182
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,479
piece

183
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,520
um

184
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
that's really all about understanding

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,080
the assessment types that you need

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
in order to

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,599
fully assess your attack surface

188
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,919
so like i said there's good news here

189
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,080
there's a ton of owasp mobile security

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
project resources to help learn

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
these actually came as kind of an

192
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,759
evolution so the market started with the

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,120
mobile top 10

194
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
but realized it wasn't quite enough

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
uh the mobile app security verification

196
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,319
standards or misvs which we're going to

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
talk more about in depth shortly uh came

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,080
about

199
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,039
uh

200
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,280
and the testing guide and checklist are

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,919
other assets that owasp has produced in

202
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,720
order to kind of provide more practical

203
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,919
advice

204
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,800
on how to really act on the mas vs the

205
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,120
mstg

206
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
so

207
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,160
one of the things that the misvs does is

208
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
create clear tiers for different types

209
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,599
of apps

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,479
if we start in that top left box

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
mas vs l1

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,440
is the minimum security requirement

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
it's best for apps that have no

214
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,680
compliance or regulatory needs

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
and are more simple applications uh so

216
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
for this whole slide we're going to use

217
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
example apps in each one of these boxes

218
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
just to help drive the point home um

219
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,639
and

220
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,160
they're all going to be from healthcare

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
because healthcare is something that we

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,120
often think about as meeting better

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
security um or

224
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
being highly secure and

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
both of those are

226
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
in in a way true um but we're going to

227
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,479
be talking about different kinds of

228
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,800
health care and medical apps here um an

229
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
example of an l1 kind of app right so if

230
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
you're building an app

231
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
that's like this you'll need to achieve

232
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,958
at least mas vs l1 security levels um

233
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,479
so

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,958
that'll be something like a webmd search

235
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,679
app that app would have no pii or strong

236
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
intellectual intellectual property

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,080
so it only requires a certain level of

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
security scrutiny

239
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
once you start to get more complex the

240
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
security requirements that you need will

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
also uh

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
get more stringent right so

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
if we think about a weight monitoring

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,519
app

245
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,839
you then have an account you have pii

246
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,279
you have regulatory and compliance

247
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
requirements you may have credit card

248
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,640
information if it's a paid app uh and

249
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,320
more right if if you have my name

250
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
date of birth location

251
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,680
where i eat food all of those kinds of

252
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
things

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
that requires some more defense in depth

254
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
and

255
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
it will require

256
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,200
more security than just an l1 level app

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
on the right side of this diagram we'll

258
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
see l1 plus r and l2 plus r

259
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
plus r just means that it's plus reverse

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
engineering resilience

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
which

262
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,440
is primarily to protect ip

263
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,279
but also is to prevent tampering right

264
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,720
so

265
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
for an l1 plus r app if we think about

266
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,320
a medical formulary app that explains to

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
doctors what medicine to mix

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
and how to make it that ip really has to

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
be protected

270
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
because

271
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
if an attacker were to maliciously

272
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
modify that application a doctor could

273
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
get the wrong recipe for medicine or

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
give the wrong mix of medicine to a

275
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
patient uh and that could be ineffective

276
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,120
or way worse deadly um so that's l one

277
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
plus r l two plus r is something that

278
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,000
has pii uh and also needs to protect ip

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,320
so a healthcare drug delivery app for

280
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
example will have pii around where

281
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
someone lives what their name is what

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
their credit card information is and

283
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
what medicine they take uh this also

284
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,959
needs to be protected from um

285
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,720
from reverse engineering because if not

286
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
then someone can change the medicine

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,040
being delivered to a customer uh and

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,240
that can also be life threatening

289
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,519
so

290
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,440
big differences right

291
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,800
uh l1 expects basic security

292
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,160
um and that those best practices be met

293
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,600
l2 requires uh deeper defense with

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
protection from things like lost device

295
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,040
uh

296
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,320
requiring cert pinning and mfa uh and

297
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,040
then

298
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,959
anything on the right side

299
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
uh has a plus r on it which means it

300
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
needs to be hardened

301
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
and resilient against reverse

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
engineering

303
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,839
the

304
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
other side of the masbs

305
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,519
is these eight domains

306
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,360
these are some more detailed

307
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,720
requirements uh that security finding to

308
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
be mapped to uh and next we're going to

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
talk about the top five areas that now

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
secure sees

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
as

312
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
problem areas that you can be focused on

313
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
to make the biggest impact

314
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,320
on your mobile app security program as

315
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
quickly as possible

316
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
it covers so the eight domains cover

317
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
everything from architecture and design

318
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
data storage and privacy cryptography

319
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
authentication network communication

320
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,959
environmental environmental interaction

321
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
code quality

322
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
and resiliency against reverse

323
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
engineering that should sound familiar

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,040
but

325
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
those are the full eight there are some

326
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
that we see as uh problems more

327
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,519
frequently uh so we're going to talk

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
about those next

329
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
so like i said where do you start what

330
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,880
are the top five focus areas for the

331
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
oasp masvs

332
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,040
well the first is data stored in an

333
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
insecure location

334
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,440
uh the analysis that now secure does of

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
apps publicly available in the mobile

336
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,320
app store shows that 50 of apps have

337
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
insecure data storage uh

338
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,720
which

339
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
is a scary statistic uh what that really

340
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
means is if an application has been

341
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,240
secured data storage uh an attacker can

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
use the device file system to steal

343
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,560
information from the app whether it's

344
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
through malware a stolen device a

345
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,880
malicious charger

346
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,320
anything along those lines

347
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,040
that app with insecure data storage can

348
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,959
lead to identity theft fraud uh any

349
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,240
other information stealing um it maps to

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
v2 and v3 of those domains that we

351
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,399
talked about earlier um

352
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,680
something that i'm going to pause and

353
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
take a second to talk about on this

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,839
slide is there are lots and lots and

355
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,000
lots of resources it's going to come out

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
more at the end of this presentation um

357
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
but we've linked resources on each one

358
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
of these pages uh for if you want to go

359
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
learn more these are all linked to

360
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
resources that you can go learn more at

361
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
so

362
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
those resources are there for you

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
as you embark on tackling data stored in

364
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,199
an insecure place

365
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,959
um

366
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,959
but some tips

367
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,680
to start with right so

368
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
from a development perspective you can

369
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
avoid writing sensitive data to a device

370
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
uh if you absolutely have to write

371
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
something to the device absolutely

372
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
encrypt it

373
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,519
if you're working with android

374
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
definitely use scoped storage

375
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,680
and avoid query strings and sensitive

376
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
data

377
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
from a securities perspective if you're

378
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,040
testing to make sure that data is stored

379
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
in a secure location uh be sure to test

380
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,120
the credentials and pii and files

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
make sure data is removed when an

382
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
application is moved to the background

383
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
and confirm that the required use

384
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,880
of a device password uh is is in place

385
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,680
so the second area for you to focus on

386
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,279
is improperly coded network calls

387
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
um

388
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,199
48

389
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,680
of mobile apps in the public app stores

390
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
have insecure data communication

391
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,519
um

392
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,199
what that really means

393
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,760
is that almost half of the apps that now

394
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,199
secure analyzes use http instead of

395
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,959
https

396
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,440
uh this means that apps are vulnerable

397
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,000
to malicious vpn attacks or other

398
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
network sniffing that occurs

399
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
uh and again can lead to identity theft

400
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
or fraud

401
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,639
we've seen instances in the past of

402
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
attacks that start with finding

403
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,040
credentials from insecure network calls

404
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
in a mobile app

405
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,880
and then the attackers then pivot into a

406
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
full-fledged attack with credential

407
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
stuffing

408
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
from a

409
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,639
more powerful pc for example so

410
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,759
um as we talk about mobile apps

411
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,040
it's important to think about the

412
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,519
impacts that can have on kind of the

413
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,120
entire world

414
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
and if you were to get

415
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,759
something from a mobile app that you can

416
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
then reuse elsewhere

417
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
that's a very real risk

418
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,839
so

419
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,360
to avoid this

420
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
be sure to use https instead of http uh

421
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,839
it's it's a quick fix

422
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,040
to change

423
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,560
um so highly recommend that

424
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,240
always generate your tls session after

425
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
an evaluation of validation and

426
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,440
of the dns name

427
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
and perform cert pinning for connections

428
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
that carry any regulated data

429
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,759
this is one of the best ways to prevent

430
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
a man in the middle attack

431
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
and for testing make sure you test your

432
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,040
tls insert painting protocols

433
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
the third

434
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
area of focus from the eight domains of

435
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,480
the msbs is insecure authentication or

436
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,399
authorization

437
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,279
so

438
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
uh this presentation has not had a lot

439
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,800
of good news so far uh we've had scary

440
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
statistics from the start uh we've

441
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
talked about people meddling with

442
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
medicine

443
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
and all of that scary stuff so here's

444
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,240
some good news for you uh only 14 of

445
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
mobile apps have insecure authentication

446
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
uh so if you're looking for an area to

447
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,480
focus less on

448
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
this is it

449
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
insecure authentication schemes are

450
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,119
still dangerous uh

451
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,160
they can allow for unauthorized access

452
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
or theft

453
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
um but generally speaking statistically

454
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
speaking it seems as though

455
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
uh off insecure authentication is

456
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,919
something that's

457
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
relatively under control

458
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
and something that we don't have to

459
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
worry too too much about so if you are

460
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
really strapped for security

461
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,960
capacity uh absolutely be sure

462
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,039
to focus in on those other areas that

463
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,480
we've talked about

464
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,039
this one is probably okay

465
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,240
but if you are part of that 14 of apps

466
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
there are some scary consequences

467
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
if this is something that you embark on

468
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,799
and something that you prioritize

469
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
here are some tips

470
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,080
devs should build sessions that time out

471
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
and clear

472
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
any memory

473
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,919
associated with user data and encryption

474
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,080
um

475
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,880
both of those are pretty standard

476
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
if you log into something

477
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
eventually you'll get logged out if you

478
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,320
sit there long enough

479
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
and

480
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
clearing the cache

481
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
of memory and

482
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
you know the user data uh is is also key

483
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
right so then

484
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
security can also test

485
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,880
uh for validation and what data is

486
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,840
staying in the memory locally um both of

487
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,160
those are

488
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
clear ways to abuse

489
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,039
authentication

490
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,559
so the fourth

491
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,640
uh of five so we're getting there uh

492
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,559
is insecure

493
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,799
insecure coding practices just more

494
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,000
generally

495
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
um

496
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
interesting statistic

497
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
47 of mobile apps have insecure

498
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,919
exploitable extraneous functionality

499
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,039
so it's insecure code in the apps that

500
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,160
isn't even used by the application

501
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
the most common instance

502
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
of this type of vulnerability that now

503
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
secure sees

504
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
is publishing an app with debug features

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
enabled uh this allows attackers to

506
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,440
reverse engineer the application to a

507
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,280
certain point

508
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,640
hypothetically uh just as a as a

509
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,799
hypothetical exercise of what could

510
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,559
actually happen with this

511
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
if an online retailer were to publish an

512
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
application that included the formula

513
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
that they use internally to generate

514
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
discount codes

515
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,520
someone could take advantage of that to

516
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
generate their own really steep

517
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
discounts

518
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,520
so make sure that if you have

519
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
any of that in your app you you know

520
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,480
turn off your debug flags and all of

521
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
that before you publish the app store

522
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,520
other things that you can do

523
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,240
uh is ensure your cryptography are

524
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,799
meeting your minimum standards uh sha-3

525
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,559
is the minimum now

526
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
utilize dynamic values and extend your

527
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,159
key length

528
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,679
at tests to make sure an app is signed

529
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,520
with valid cert

530
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
and is not a debug build

531
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,360
and does not have hard-coded keys built

532
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,280
in or coded in

533
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,320
to the application itself

534
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,120
so the fifth area

535
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
uh is

536
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,039
your reverse engineering and

537
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,480
anti-tampering

538
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
um we've talked about this as the plus r

539
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
and we've talked about this as one of

540
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
the domains uh but this should be the

541
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,480
fifth thing that you focus on the most

542
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,960
uh almost a third of the apps available

543
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,559
on app stores today

544
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
have exposure to renew reverse

545
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,039
engineering

546
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
this means that an attacker could steal

547
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,240
data ip or get unauthorized access to an

548
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,120
app

549
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,919
they can also learn more ways to exploit

550
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,760
the application once it is reverse

551
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,840
engineered

552
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,799
um

553
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,200
as they have kind of full reign over the

554
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
app at that point

555
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,080
so

556
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
how to harden your app

557
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,880
against reverse engineering

558
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
be sure to use third-party code

559
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,039
obfuscation tools specifically for

560
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,280
android apps ios

561
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
has a little bit more security built in

562
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
um but

563
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,919
certainly focus on this for both

564
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,880
operating systems

565
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,799
android also has the safety net api

566
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,240
which you can use to check for device

567
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,280
tampering

568
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,520
and then when testing make sure you look

569
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,600
for reversibility

570
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
via

571
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,480
jb root debugger and data or file

572
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
manipulation

573
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,039
just a note

574
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
on tamper proofing

575
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
so tamper proofing helps but only so

576
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,080
much

577
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,039
it won't fix security bugs in production

578
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,480
um

579
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,760
but it can help keep your app safe

580
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
for example if you have insecure network

581
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
connections tamper proofing will not

582
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,760
protect your app from those attacks

583
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
but it will help protect your app from

584
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,080
reverse engineering

585
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,159
so it's a way to

586
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
keep the good guys honest

587
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,399
but not necessarily stop the bad ones

588
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
so some key takeaways uh i've been

589
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,440
talking for a little bit uh and wanted

590
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
to do some key takeaways here

591
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
uh

592
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,559
what can you go do

593
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,120
uh first is to recognize and understand

594
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,280
that mobile app and web apps are very

595
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,880
different they have very unique

596
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,520
challenges uh and they

597
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,320
you know

598
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,960
face different uh threat landscapes

599
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,520
there's a lot there

600
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,679
get to know the oauth mobile project

601
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,640
more

602
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
and start exploring there are a ton a

603
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,799
ton a ton of resources on the masvs

604
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,840
and

605
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
other mobile projects that os has

606
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,120
presented

607
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,320
and

608
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
just look around there are there's a lot

609
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,159
of resources on this

610
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
um

611
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
you can also build your skills uh and

612
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,679
toolkit with free tools publicly

613
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,760
available open source tools

614
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
um

615
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
that will help sharpen your skills when

616
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,159
it comes to

617
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,720
either writing secure mobile apps uh if

618
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
you're on the coding side

619
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
or secure

620
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
testing the security of your mobile apps

621
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
if you're on the security side

622
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
um

623
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
there are uh eight requirements to help

624
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,919
break down this problem those those

625
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,240
eight domains that we talked about uh

626
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
and you can start with the big five that

627
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,120
we talked about today

628
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,760
uh you can even narrow down to three

629
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,279
uh if you really need to and then

630
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,720
um

631
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
the other

632
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
kind of thing that i'll say here the

633
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
other plug that i'll have here uh is

634
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,919
that the oauth mobile project is open

635
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
source uh so get involved

636
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,799
it's an open source project um so you

637
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,880
can absolutely be be an asset to to help

638
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,120
um

639
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
there's some bonus

640
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
uh content here

641
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,159
uh

642
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,120
at the end of this presentation uh

643
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,159
talking about cyclone dx so

644
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,880
uh the cyclone dx has its own session

645
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
here at global appsec i actually think

646
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
it's happening right now

647
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,320
um but wanted to cover off on it quickly

648
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,960
it's the new flagship project at a wasp

649
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
and it's the new industry standard for

650
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,000
s-bomb interpret

651
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,559
interoperability

652
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,760
hardware to say um

653
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,039
basically

654
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,279
uh in case you're unaware

655
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
s-bomb is a software bill of materials

656
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,440
uh a software bill of materials is an

657
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,400
extensive list of all of the components

658
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,559
inside of your application

659
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,799
if you think about it in terms of recipe

660
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,559
or or something along those lines it's

661
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,679
all of the

662
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
um

663
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
all of the ingredients

664
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,799
in your recipe all of the components in

665
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,240
your application think about those the

666
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
same way

667
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,840
and

668
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
cyclone dx is an industry standard

669
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
format

670
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,799
that's machine readable

671
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,200
that allows for organizations to get

672
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,760
greater visibility into the components

673
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,240
of their application kind of across

674
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,720
their app portfolio

675
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,559
so

676
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,960
that's cyclone dx

677
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
now secure firmly believes

678
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,200
that everyone should have that

679
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
visibility into their their components

680
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
um

681
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,200
we think that every organization should

682
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
have that visibility uh so you can get

683
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
some for free uh they won't be in

684
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
cyclone dx format but you can understand

685
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,960
what

686
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
um what components are in your app today

687
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
for free

688
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,320
and

689
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,520
as promised i talked a lot about further

690
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,960
learning resources and there's a lot

691
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,760
so we will talk about those

692
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
now

693
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
if you're trying to build your own

694
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,880
mobile app security tools or program

695
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
there are a ton of open source testing

696
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,960
resources and tools available

697
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,120
there's the m-a-s-v-s which is what this

698
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,799
presentation was about

699
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,200
uh there's the mstg

700
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
uh repo

701
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,000
uh

702
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,880
hacking playgrounds uh frida and radari

703
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
are both

704
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
publicly available

705
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,520
tools one is that frida is a dynamic

706
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
instrumentation toolkit

707
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
and radare is a portable reverse

708
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,480
engineering framework

709
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
both of those are free and publicly

710
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
available

711
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,159
you can also utilize

712
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
burp suite or

713
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
the zed attack proxy which also comes

714
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,039
from obas

715
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,960
if you've already built

716
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
something and are looking to automate

717
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,520
testing and scale

718
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
like i said there's the free mobile

719
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,200
s-bom

720
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,799
and security report that you can get

721
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,799
from now secure

722
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,360
we also have a workstation toolkit and a

723
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,039
platform that you can use to automate

724
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,240
so

725
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,159
there are even more resources

726
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:40,880
so

727
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,200
if you are looking for free training now

728
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
secure has now secure academy

729
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:46,960
which

730
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,919
is a completely free resource that you

731
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
can use to learn more about mobile

732
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,080
security and development and we also

733
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
have now secure connect coming up next

734
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,000
week next week which has a ton of

735
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,039
content around mobile security testing

736
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,000
um i've actually already mentioned both

737
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
of these

738
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,120
reports that you can get

739
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
um but we also have more free resources

740
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,360
for you uh the manager's guide to a wasp

741
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
mobile security project is essentially

742
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,200
the spark notes of the misvs and mstg

743
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
if you're looking to learn about it very

744
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,320
quickly

745
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,440
that is a good place to start

746
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
there's also

747
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,120
this top five

748
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,960
mobile app security issues document that

749
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,440
we've created um

750
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,360
it's going to cover the top five that we

751
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,960
talked about today

752
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
so if you have questions if you need

753
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
more information

754
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,960
if you want to share this out

755
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,399
absolutely do so

756
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,159
uh and then the other

757
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
uh thing that i'll plug on this slide is

758
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,799
that our r2 community also released an

759
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,760
android crackme um so that is a good way

760
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,440
to practice uh and understand how mobile

761
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,060
app security actually plays out

762
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,279
[Music]

763
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,159
and

764
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,840
if you're looking to learn more now

765
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
secure has a ton of options we have a

766
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,679
resource for you we are here as a

767
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,520
resource for you on your mobile appsec

768
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,480
journey

769
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
so with that

770
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,000
i'm a little bit over the
