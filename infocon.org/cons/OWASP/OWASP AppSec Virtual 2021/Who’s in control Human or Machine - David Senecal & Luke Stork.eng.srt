2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,520
hi everyone and thank you for uh for the

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,200
introduction um i'm sure that if you're

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,679
in the audience and managing a website

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,440
i'm sure that you're very familiar with

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,880
the topics that we're going to talk

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
about today which is but

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,199
over the years their numbers and

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,080
complexity has increased significantly

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,439
this meaning that us defenders had to go

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,840
in all lengths to to improve our

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,479
detection in order to be able to to keep

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,360
up and stay ahead as much as possible

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,239
uh in order to be able to uh to detect

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
them and defend the side against them

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,800
my name is david senecal i'm the vp of

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,480
project architecture

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,120
and research at arcos labs and i've been

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
spending the last 10 years of my

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,039
professional careers

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
chasing bots around the internet and

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,920
with me i've got a pleasure to uh to

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,879
have

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,800
luke stork

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
hi thanks david yeah i'm luke stork i've

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,760
been uh working in data science data

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,119
science and machine learning for about

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,200
the last five or six years

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
i started at the air force research lab

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
doing some human computer interface

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
research and then moved on to a

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
biometric startup in about the last year

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
i've been working with david on trying

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,280
to improve a product for detecting bot

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
and and human fraud

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
right so today let's talk about the

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
agenda so first you know we i talked

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,600
briefly about introducing the topic of

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
bots uh uh let's talk first about the

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,840
the type of attacks that we are seeing

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
and

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
second i think it's uh it would be good

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,479
to to kind of talk about as well uh what

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,960
drives the attack sort of sophistication

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
you know why do we see

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,439
uh the persistence in those attacks over

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
and over again

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
and like i said earlier i've been doing

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,360
this for for the last 10 years and over

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
time i've seen the attack evolve pretty

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
significantly and i want to give you an

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
insight about what i've seen over the

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
last 10 years where we were 10 years ago

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,160
and where we are now

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
and

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
as a follow-up then we'll we'll double

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,480
click

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
in some of the most complex and advanced

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,680
method that we're using today which is

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
behavioral detection

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
so without further ado let's look into

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
the type of attacks

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
so

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
when we talk about attacks we talk um

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
you sometimes hear about account

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
takeover fake account creations carding

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,879
denial of the inventory inventory

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,680
scraping but what do they really mean so

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,040
for example uh i can't i can't take over

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
typically those attacking takeover

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
really take place on the login endpoint

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
where attackers are typically buying uh

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,360
credentials that were stolen on the

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,519
internet and then posted

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,159
um posted on the dark web and there's a

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,560
lot of marketplace available out there

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
where you can actually buy credit uh

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
stolen credential and what attackers do

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
is that they buy those credentials and

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
keep replaying them over and over again

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,440
against multiple targets

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
taking advantage of the fact that a lot

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
of internet users actually end up

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
reusing the same username and password

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,239
across

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,120
a lot of website meaning that if

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
a credential is valid on one given

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
website where the credentials were

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
stolen chances are it's also valid on

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
other website and then once

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
they verify

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,840
that

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,440
a credential is valid then um they can

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
take over the account to actually resell

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,840
those verified accounts to somebody else

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
to take it to the next level and take

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
over the account

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
so luke what do you know about fake

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
account creation

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
yeah fake account creation is another

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,640
really common type of attack and it's

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
you know common on many different types

103
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,280
of platforms from you know e-commerce to

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
travel websites to you know uh what we

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,959
hear in the news like social media

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,799
accounts with fake accounts that you

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,519
know spread misinformation and and spam

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
so yeah it's a really common type of

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,400
abuse and it can happen in a number of

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
different forms you know you could have

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
a a human actor that that's coming in

112
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,918
there and just putting in fake

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,279
information and creating these accounts

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,560
one by one

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
or you could have an automated system

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
that that goes in um and and really

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
rapidly creates a high volume of

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,199
accounts um but but it's a particularly

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
bad type of attack because

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
it can only take one or two accounts say

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
on like like a gaming platform you have

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
one or two fake accounts that get

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
created um and and these accounts can

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
really be you know they can spam other

125
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
users and really degrade the user

126
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,479
experience for for everyone on the site

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
so so it's a really a really bad type of

128
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
attack that can happen so yeah and uh

129
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
you know one point to an additional

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
point is like once the fake account is

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
created they can potentially be used to

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
uh you know to to take to do a different

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
type of attack which for example coding

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
so they would we use the fake account to

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
actually test uh credit card numbers uh

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
to see to see if they're valid or not

137
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
and then valid then make purchase from

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
them uh or also uh try to do the similar

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
things with gift cards so that's you

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
know pretty much like

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
the second layer of that attack is it's

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
typically carving

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,120
so look what what do you know about

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
inventory scraping

145
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
yeah yeah it's it's another type of

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
attack and and you know it it might not

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
even be necessarily attack there's

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
there's a lot of you know benign

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,199
automation on on the internet and

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
actually you know most web traffic is is

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
this type of you know benign automation

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
that that um you know

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
just has these web scrapers that that go

154
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
around the web that aggregate

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,639
information that that figure out the

156
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,759
best price for goods and services so so

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,280
these types of automation aren't

158
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
necessarily bad and they help the

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
internet function but but what makes it

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
bad is is when when this automation goes

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,319
to to try to find information that that

162
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,919
we don't want to see it it tries to

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,840
scrape information personal information

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,560
from social media profiles or or or

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
tries to dig in further to get

166
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,479
information that we don't want to see so

167
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,000
um that that's where it really becomes

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
an attack and and and we want to be able

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
to detect and stop those cases yeah so

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
for example like web search engine

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,319
obviously is good traffic that we want

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
to see a web website owners do want web

173
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
search engine to actually go through

174
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,800
their site so that their content can be

175
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
indexed and made available to uh

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
to users but you know obviously when uh

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
that scraping is done by competitors

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
who's trying to take an advantage on the

179
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
pricing and so on uh that that's

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
definitely bad things and sometimes it

181
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,919
can lead to some various sales issues

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,199
for the website owner takes the travel

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
industry for example uh if too much of

184
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,080
the scraping is done and depending on

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
the workflow uh from the within the

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
website uh it can sometimes lead to

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,039
actually denial or event inventory

188
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,280
because the scraper is potentially

189
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
trying to you know check

190
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
uh the availability of say a

191
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
sit on a plane or room in a hotel

192
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,599
uh

193
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
while they do this

194
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
sometimes you have process where

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
the the actual room or the seat is kind

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
of locked for a little while and then

197
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
they can lock the whole inventory for

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
all legitimate other users who may

199
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,880
actually want to uh to purchase

200
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
those uh those available seats or room

201
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
uh so it can definitely lead to serious

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,440
uh you know add some sales

203
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,880
consequent consequences for for the

204
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,080
actual website owner

205
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
yeah so so you outlined all these types

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
of attacks but so dave you've been

207
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
working on this for a while like what

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
what what drives like this attack

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
sophistication what why why do they get

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,199
really really sophisticated

211
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,120
yeah so what i've learned typically is

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
really what drives a sophistication of

213
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,280
the attack is the

214
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
it's pretty much the the potential for

215
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
monetization of the containers being

216
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
abused so the the lower if the

217
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
potential for monetization is low then

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
potentially you'll see uh sophistication

219
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
of the attacks at you know that that's

220
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,479
pretty low as well and the persistence

221
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
is pretty persistent is pretty low so

222
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
you're gonna find like more basic

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,599
botnets who

224
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,599
will do do their things and as soon as

225
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,240
you got a decent defense in place then

226
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
they will go away and they will try to

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
uh to go after a different target

228
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,159
however if the

229
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
the potential for monetization is very

230
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
high uh you know let's say

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,519
by spending one hour and trying to get

232
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,760
the content and they can have a resale

233
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,599
value for a hundred dollars let's say or

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
even more then uh you know the the value

235
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,120
for them is so much uh that it's

236
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
actually they can make a good living out

237
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,000
of out of this so in that case

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,519
they will try

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,000
very hard to actually uh

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
defeat all detection in place and that's

241
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
where you're gonna see the most

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
sophisticated attacks uh with with you

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
know very high persistence you know i've

244
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
seen over the years

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
uh some accounts that i've been working

246
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
with where pretty much they're one of a

247
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
kind where you know they the value from

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
abusing logins or cracking an account or

249
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
abusing some gift card

250
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,040
or loyalty points um

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,519
program it's so lucrative that the

252
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,760
attackers will keep going at it no

253
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
matter how many how much defense that

254
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,120
you have in place

255
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
yeah

256
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
so what kind of

257
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
you have these really sophisticated um

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
attacks that happen so i i'm sure

259
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
there's kind of a spectrum of attacks

260
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
that that we see so like what what's a

261
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
good starting point like a really basic

262
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
form i guess

263
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
yeah i mean you cannot bring him back it

264
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
brings me back to like 10 years ago

265
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
where i started uh trying to uh to play

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,200
around defending against botnets and uh

267
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
you know at the time things were much

268
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
easier because the botnets were pretty

269
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,760
small fairly unsophisticated that we

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,399
were looking at like very fairly basic

271
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,480
scripts uh the number of nodes was in

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
the botnets was fairly limited you're

273
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,240
talking about like maybe a few dozens of

274
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
botnets or nodes within the botnet so in

275
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
that case you know defending was pretty

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,760
easy where pretty much ip blocking would

277
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
do it you know that was that wasn't

278
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
satire to actually do the inventory of

279
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
ips i would they would attacking you

280
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
because uh

281
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,640
it's easy to find them because you would

282
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,399
see like a very large number of requests

283
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,560
coming from very specific set of ips

284
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
where the rest you know it's pretty much

285
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
in the

286
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
in the lower much lower range so ip

287
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
blocking would do the trick rate

288
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
limiting as well would do the trick and

289
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,880
because

290
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
the script was so simplistic uh then you

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,519
know a set of custom rules would do the

292
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,519
trick as well because the the format of

293
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,240
the request would pronounce potentially

294
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
very different than the format of html

295
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
requests coming from a regular chrome or

296
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
firefox so then it's well easy enough to

297
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
uh to detect

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
makes sense so okay so you got these i

299
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
guess dumbbots but what what's like the

300
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
next next stage from there how do they

301
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
get you know more sophisticated yeah so

302
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,519
basically the level of sophistication

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
increase as your level of detection

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
increases so then the next stage when

305
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
you've got all this you know very basic

306
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
detection in place typically what you'll

307
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,839
see is that the botnet will evolve they

308
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,800
become larger to evade your ip blocking

309
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
it's harder for you to do the inventory

310
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,600
and then because the botnet is larger

311
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
we're talking about maybe a few hundred

312
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
nodes within the botnet then in that

313
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
case rate limiting becomes less

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
effective because each node within the

315
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
botnet is able to only make a few

316
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
requests per

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
per minute or per second and you know it

318
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,279
feels it it's blends in uh with the the

319
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
you know the rest of the crowd

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
uh

321
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,079
so to defend against this then um

322
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,839
you know that's where ip intelligence

323
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
comes in because where are the blocking

324
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
right limiting will fail if you look at

325
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
the traffic from a longer period of time

326
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
if you look at the reputation of an ip

327
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,279
of a longer period of time so what you

328
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,680
get typically from ip intelligence then

329
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
in that case you will be able to uh to

330
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,440
kind of differentiate between

331
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
potentially the you know these detect

332
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
the nodes within the bot nets but that's

333
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,839
that's not enough because um you know

334
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,600
another thing that you need to do is

335
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
typically those basic bots they don't

336
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
run javascript so what you can do is

337
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
actually inject

338
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
some some javascript challenge into your

339
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
code

340
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,680
to be able to validate whether they do

341
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
run javascript or not and if they do

342
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,120
then you want to collect the

343
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
fingerprints from them to kind of you

344
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
know look at the device characteristic

345
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,279
and these other things

346
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,880
to kind of see what kind of system

347
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,519
you're dealing with

348
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,320
okay so we got you know 100 node botnet

349
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
that can run javascript what's what's

350
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
the next level of sophistication from

351
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
here

352
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,680
right so yeah of course you know my job

353
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
is never over and our job is never over

354
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
right so you know once now you you're

355
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,079
happy you kind of dealt with your larger

356
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,000
botnet you feel like you you've done it

357
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
all and you've taken care of the problem

358
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,040
fortunately that's not the case because

359
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,839
for again if the the the incentive is

360
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,680
there then the attackers will go above

361
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
and beyond

362
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,959
to try to defeat your detection so the

363
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
next stage is actually the botnet go

364
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
even goes even larger you know we were

365
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,399
talking about a few hundred nodes now

366
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,000
we're talking about a few thousand nodes

367
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,839
and it's actually not uncommon to

368
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,839
actually see botnets that are you know

369
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
have more than ten thousand nodes uh

370
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
within the within the network so that's

371
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
you know then that case ip intelligence

372
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
becomes you know that that doesn't that

373
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
it's not very efficient

374
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,079
um

375
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,760
so

376
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
and as well um

377
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,639
you know

378
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
when we test for whether the clown super

379
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
javascript our one way or one of the

380
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,199
basic way to know whether the classes

381
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,680
for javascript or not is if we see that

382
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,279
they're sending a fingerprint then

383
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,360
that's like okay now you you're good

384
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
you're you're giving us a thing your

385
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,839
fingerprint therefore you must be uh

386
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,560
running javascript but it's easy enough

387
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
for an attacker to actually simulate

388
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,320
sending a fingerprint they know that

389
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,399
well that's what we expect uh so

390
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,839
therefore they're going to just give us

391
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
a fingerprint and

392
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
and sometimes what they do is like they

393
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,279
randomize certain values within the

394
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
device characters things that we want to

395
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
collect actually it's very common

396
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,240
and

397
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
so that to to kind of defeat any

398
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
detection in place that would pinpoint

399
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
on very specific characteristic like

400
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
particular version of browser os or you

401
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,600
know certain characteristics so then in

402
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
that case uh in terms of detection you

403
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
again you have to advance a lot more

404
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,160
like a simple rule engine for looking at

405
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
specific specific characteristics or

406
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
anomalies uh won't do it you need

407
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,800
something a bit more advanced with like

408
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,279
device intelligence for example who can

409
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,440
recognize you know legitimate system

410
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
versus non-estimate system meaning html

411
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
fingerprint versus non-instrument

412
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
fingerprints

413
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
proof of work as well is a good way to

414
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,980
force the cloud to actually

415
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,399
[Music]

416
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
run the javascript because proof of work

417
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
will is based on the javascript ability

418
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
to to kind of resolve a cryptographic

419
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
challenge and the cryptography challenge

420
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,639
will be unique every time so it cannot

421
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,279
become pre-complete pre-computed so in

422
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
that case uh you know it's a good way to

423
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
to really force a client to to run

424
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,440
javascript and of course you need to

425
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
also be sure you have some replay

426
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
detection in place uh because you know

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
some attackers will be clever enough to

428
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,320
kind of replay a good fingerprint and

429
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
you need to be able to recognize that as

430
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,079
well

431
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,399
okay so we have really really large

432
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,440
botnets now that can run javascript and

433
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
spoof legitimate device signatures but

434
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,519
like how does it get any more

435
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,120
sophisticated from there

436
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
oh it always gets the most sophisticated

437
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,399
and

438
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
you know once you really push them to

439
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
run javascript then they go headless

440
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
browsers because headless browser of

441
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
course they can run javascript all day

442
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
long so then your proof of work becomes

443
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
ineffective device intel also becomes

444
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,199
somewhat ineffective because in that

445
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
case the finger the

446
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,440
the signature of the that the headless

447
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,839
browser send is valid you know like

448
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,199
headless chrome the same as chrome

449
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,720
internal fingerprint or there's very

450
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,160
little difference something you can make

451
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,199
out

452
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,160
um

453
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
so that then you know you really need to

454
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,839
uh to kind of step up your headless

455
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,279
browser detection

456
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
and then you also need to look at how

457
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,079
the user is interacting with the system

458
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,480
with the with the machine that that

459
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
you're receiving your request from

460
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
and uh how it's interacting with the

461
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,040
website of all so that's where we start

462
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
talking about behavioral detection which

463
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,880
is you know the bulk of our topic today

464
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,600
and that's why you come in look so luck

465
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
look sorry um tell us about behavioral

466
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
detection what what does it mean what is

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,959
it like

468
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,800
yeah yeah there's there's a couple

469
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
different sides of that there's for

470
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
behavioral detection there's behavioral

471
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,639
biometrics um which which is we'll touch

472
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,959
on a bit later um and then kind of a

473
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,959
broader more more simplistic arm of

474
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
behavioral detection which is user

475
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
behavioral analysis

476
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
um and this is kind of just a high-level

477
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,000
method that that looks at a way a user

478
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,799
interacts with a web service um and this

479
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
can be you know just just the series of

480
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,359
steps they take when they're you know

481
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
logging into an account or or making a

482
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
purchase just just those high level

483
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,919
contextual interactions is kind of what

484
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
comprises user behavioral analysis um it

485
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,799
also can take into consideration you

486
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,080
know the their geolocation and uh the

487
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
the timing of the visits and and the the

488
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
frequency of page interaction so so

489
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,799
those those really high level metrics

490
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,160
okay and so what about uh behavioral

491
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
biometrics and what's um

492
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,679
what does it mean really what what are

493
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,280
we looking at

494
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
yeah yeah so so behavioral biometric

495
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
detection is different from behavioral

496
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,799
analysis because we're looking at like

497
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,760
the actual ways that a user interacts

498
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,080
with their device so for like a

499
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,919
traditional desktop session we're

500
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,160
looking at these uh mouse and keyboard

501
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
events the actual you know frequency of

502
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
these typing events the the speed of

503
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
their mouse motion and and those sort of

504
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,200
things and then for the the mobile side

505
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
of things we're we're looking at the the

506
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,679
touch interactions on their phone um and

507
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
even more complex systems can look at

508
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
you know motion sensor events and and

509
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760
that sort of thing

510
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
right so we're going to dig uh double

511
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
click on each one of this detection

512
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,919
method to really you know give give some

513
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
insight to our audience about what you

514
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,919
know what that means and what the really

515
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,760
text to kind of handle these solo

516
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,799
signals

517
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
uh but before we do that let's go over

518
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,520
like you know kind of discuss the use

519
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,799
case we're trying to resolve with

520
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,880
behavioral detection so again you know

521
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
botnet detection is definitely uh one

522
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,679
one good use case to be really really be

523
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
able to differentiate to kind of by

524
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,840
seeing how the

525
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,679
the client is interacting with the site

526
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,840
or the machine then we can differentiate

527
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,960
between automation and and human but

528
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
also by by looking at how the

529
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,640
interactions happening we can

530
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
potentially also start differentiating

531
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
between legitimate users and people who

532
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
want to start committing fraud so you

533
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
cannot get maybe a bit of a sense of the

534
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,520
intent as well uh but not only that um

535
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,799
that's also a good way to to evaluate um

536
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,919
you know for for legitimate users that

537
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
has no bad behaviors and they're just

538
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,520
doing the stuff that we expect the

539
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
regular users to do

540
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,240
then

541
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,679
to be able to better

542
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,320
identify them so that we can give them a

543
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
better user experience when they're

544
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,799
returning to the site

545
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,280
so let's uh dig deeper into the user

546
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,160
behavior analysis so you know look tell

547
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
us tell us more

548
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,880
yeah yeah so so a deeper dive into this

549
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
this aspect of behavioral detection um

550
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
and again we're looking at these high

551
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,400
level contextual interactions um and and

552
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
kind of here on on the right we have a

553
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
like a heat map of mouse motion so a lot

554
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,320
of these metrics kind of overlap with uh

555
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,559
techniques that marketers use to to

556
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
examine you know interactions with with

557
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,679
ads or or you know user experience

558
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
researchers that want to know how how

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
effectively a user can navigate through

560
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
a website so a lot of those same metrics

561
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
can be used on on the security side of

562
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,400
things to to to verify like the

563
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
authentic the authenticity of a user

564
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,480
session so

565
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,159
kind of more more granularity into those

566
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
metrics where we're going to be looking

567
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,919
at like the number of pages that that

568
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
they visited maybe maybe the the

569
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
sequence of events that that led them up

570
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,640
to this session and that can be really

571
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
telling for for um kind of a contextual

572
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,039
point of view you know if if you're

573
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
seeing a lot of sessions that you know

574
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
just just begin their their browsing

575
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
session with with this page over and

576
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
over again you know that that might be a

577
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,520
red flag for for for um detection um and

578
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,679
again like on that same note the visit

579
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,080
frequency to a page or are they you know

580
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,039
trying to

581
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,880
visit a login page you know

582
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
10 times a day 20 times a day that's

583
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
that that could be a red flag as well

584
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,159
um

585
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,559
and again the the time spent per visit

586
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
and per page is you know a key metric

587
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,520
because

588
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,039
like david outlined earlier we have

589
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,600
these really complex automated systems

590
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
and and they're financially motivated so

591
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
they want to be really efficient with

592
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,480
how they navigate these web pages so so

593
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,760
they're going to be they're going to do

594
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,840
these actions as quick as they can to to

595
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,559
really um improve their margins on the

596
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,240
fraud they're trying to commit so the

597
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
time spent per page is is really key

598
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
because normal user browsing you know

599
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,919
you're going to scroll down a page

600
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,120
you're going to pause you're going to

601
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
hover you're going to read it's you just

602
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
don't see see that type of behavior for

603
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,600
for really really large automated

604
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
systems um

605
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,840
yeah and you know the one point of you

606
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,919
making like on the how the user is

607
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,679
browsing the website how is it accessing

608
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,200
a particular resource i've seen that

609
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
many many times in the past where

610
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
especially on the case of account

611
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
takeover or credential stuffing attack

612
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,679
where they're replaying a large list of

613
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,080
username and password all too often what

614
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,440
you're saying is just they're simply

615
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
making a post request with a login

616
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
they're not even know going in any user

617
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,240
web page before not the home page not

618
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
browsing any product if it's a

619
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,880
commercial and not even loading the the

620
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
login form itself uh directly all you

621
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
see is a post request so that's

622
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,559
definitely can can be a good

623
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
way to tell uh you know where we're

624
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
dealing with uh legitimate activity or

625
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,679
not

626
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,280
yeah yeah just it just misses that

627
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,840
context going up to that event yeah yeah

628
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
so now let's talk a bit more about the

629
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,720
vivo biometrics so let's talk about uh

630
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,480
you know the sort of data points that we

631
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,720
want to uh to collect in that case from

632
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,159
you know depending on the type of client

633
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,720
because imaging between um you know

634
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,000
desktop laptop brow

635
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
mobile devices and even in our case at

636
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,919
our course we're actually dealing with

637
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,400
like even game console and smart tvs so

638
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,559
then the interaction with those type of

639
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,880
device completely different so

640
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
what does it look like from a point of

641
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
view of uh you know desktop and laptop

642
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
more traditional devices

643
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,960
yeah yeah so that's that's exactly

644
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
that's where behavior biometrics

645
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
traditionally originated was kind of

646
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,679
these this desktop session of these

647
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,120
mouse and keyboard events we're looking

648
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
at you know the frequency of keystrokes

649
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
and and the the speed of the mouse

650
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,159
motion that's that's the traditional

651
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,480
form of behavioral biometrics yeah

652
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
and then we go on to the

653
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
the kind of the mobile world where um

654
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
we're gonna we don't have those those

655
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
mouse events or those those key events

656
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,280
necessarily so we're gonna have to look

657
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,960
at you know touch interactions on the

658
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
device and and those motion sensor

659
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,360
events to give to give context to that

660
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,120
user session yeah

661
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,960
yeah that can be a bit tricky with

662
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
mobile because you can actually hook up

663
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,600
as well a keyboard or mouse to a mobile

664
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,440
device where sometimes would not you

665
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,279
know test kind of a bit of a

666
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
blur sometime and you do also have some

667
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,320
laptops now that actually do support uh

668
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,640
touch on the on the screen so

669
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
yeah that that's a great point it's not

670
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,000
really

671
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
you can't cleanly separate devices into

672
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
mobile and desktop necessarily anymore

673
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,799
it's it's kind of a hybrid you have you

674
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,720
know yeah touchscreen interactions and

675
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
it can be difficult to differentiate

676
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
yeah for sure so what about uh you know

677
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,919
to smart tvs game console what do we get

678
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,320
out of those like when i'm interacting

679
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,240
with my remote on my smart tv to try to

680
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,559
log in on on netflix for example what

681
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,240
kind of interaction can you get out of

682
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
that

683
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
yeah yeah and again this is a whole

684
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
nother world for for data collection

685
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
here for like game controllers a lot of

686
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
those events get get translated down

687
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
into you know key press events and that

688
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,679
sort of thing so so we can interpret

689
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,559
that information that way but you know

690
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,000
there's a whole other world that's

691
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,840
coming with these iot devices i mean you

692
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,240
have your thermostats and doorbells and

693
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,120
you know

694
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,679
your refrigerator interactions so it

695
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,360
just it's a whole world of different

696
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,640
interactions that we're dealing with

697
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,440
yeah

698
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
yeah now the

699
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
fundaments for us

700
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,679
right

701
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,000
all right cool so um

702
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
right so i mean obviously rich rich

703
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,400
amount of data tons of data here but you

704
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
know how do we sample what what's the

705
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
right sampling of that that sort of data

706
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
yeah yeah and this is a really important

707
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
point to have a successful behavioral

708
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
biometric implementation it's it's all

709
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,320
about how you sample the data um

710
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
because these these these types of

711
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,640
events have a huge volume of data you

712
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
can't you simply can't adjust it all

713
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,600
like you would ruin the client

714
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
experience you would overload your

715
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,039
database and you wouldn't even be able

716
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,640
to get the information you want so you

717
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
have to really be smart about how you

718
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
sample it and in the first and and kind

719
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,799
of simplest way to do that is in an

720
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
unconstrained way across you know say a

721
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,039
web page you you're going to sample this

722
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,600
information at maybe you know a one to

723
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
two second interval

724
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,919
um

725
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
per event and you would just collect you

726
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,919
know whatever mouse events happen in

727
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,000
that window whatever key oppressed

728
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,159
events happen in that window and you

729
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,200
would just make sure that they're

730
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
consistent with what what the client

731
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,559
should be sending you

732
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,600
and

733
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,760
another form of this um

734
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,039
the other the other side of the point i

735
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,679
guess is constrained sampling

736
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,080
and this is when you have a specific

737
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,440
window that that you're looking to

738
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
collect these events in um and this is

739
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,039
you know say during password entry or um

740
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
like in our case during during a captcha

741
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
session so your you have the specified

742
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
window and you're you're you're going to

743
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,520
collect all these events and you're

744
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
going to make sure that they're they're

745
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
consistent and they have the information

746
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,279
that you want

747
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
and and again you you you just can't

748
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
collect all the data so so you really

749
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
have to narrow down that window that

750
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,039
you're focusing on

751
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
well typically how you know what's the

752
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,559
sample side you're looking at how many

753
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,039
events are good enough uh

754
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
to to have like a good good sample to

755
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,120
work with

756
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,799
yeah there's definitely a spectrum i

757
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,279
mean for for simple bot detection you

758
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,600
know a case would be just just make sure

759
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,760
the client sends you mouse events just

760
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,520
make sure that those events are there

761
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
that that's the simplest case and then

762
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,039
like like we'll touch on a little bit

763
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,120
later like um if you want really

764
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,720
sophisticated bot detection you're going

765
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
to have to collect more data you're

766
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,559
going to have to look at you know the

767
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,400
the time series of that data to make

768
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
sure that that it actually looks like

769
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
it's human so um basically like like

770
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
your earlier point the more

771
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,799
sophisticated you want your detection to

772
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,559
be the more data you're going to have to

773
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,679
collect

774
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,559
okay so let's look now at uh you know

775
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720
how we use that data right so now we got

776
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,480
let's say look at we are looking at our

777
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,640
mouse mouse mouse mouse data right

778
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,279
so how what can we do with that

779
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
yeah yeah so so the simplest form of

780
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,600
looking at mouse motion of data is is

781
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
just the timing just looking at the

782
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
trajectory of a mouse or touchpad

783
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,159
interaction and here on the left we have

784
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,880
you know a simple human interaction this

785
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
this is the mouse x coordinate um on the

786
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,640
y-axis versus time on the right so this

787
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,399
is just someone clicking at the top of a

788
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,279
page and moving their mouse uh to the

789
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,120
right a little bit and you can kind of

790
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
see on this trajectory here it's

791
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
uh it's it's not really even you kind of

792
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,760
get lumps of those coordinates um

793
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
it's it's kind of uh you get those kind

794
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
of curvy things at the end it's a little

795
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
bit chaotic and

796
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,080
not not the cleanest necessarily and

797
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
then here on on the right uh we have a a

798
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,840
machine profile on the same web page

799
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
that was just um

800
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,679
this would be the the really dumb bot

801
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,360
that david outlined earlier that that's

802
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,440
just explicitly programmed to click

803
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
certain events and you can see it's just

804
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
really clean uh the events happen at a

805
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
specified interval

806
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
um you don't you don't have that really

807
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,559
rich time series trajectory

808
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,520
okay okay so time motion is one thing so

809
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
what else what else can we use

810
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
yeah yeah and again as we move up this

811
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,919
sophistication line here to detect more

812
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,080
sophisticated bots we can look at the

813
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,480
velocity of the mouse motion so

814
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
um on the left here with the the human

815
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
motion that that same motion that we're

816
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
looking at on the last slide uh the

817
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,520
velocity profile of this you can kind of

818
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720
see these peaks and valleys it's it it

819
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,679
moves quickly and slowly it's it's it's

820
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
not not really clean not linear um

821
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,799
and that's that's typical human web

822
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,640
interactions they're they're chaotic and

823
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
messy there's there's really no rhyme or

824
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
reason for events sometimes it's it's

825
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
it's it's kind of jagged in peaks and

826
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,200
valleys yeah right and and then on on

827
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
the right for for the machine

828
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,960
interaction you're going to get really

829
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,279
linear events um for these simplistic

830
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
interactions and um it'll be a

831
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,600
consistent velocity from from one point

832
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,679
to another and you're not going to see

833
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,399
that that that sort of the rich profile

834
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
that you do on the left

835
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,720
all right all right cool fascinating so

836
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,440
and so what about acceleration

837
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,240
yep taking it another degree further so

838
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,080
say you have a sophisticated bot that

839
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,240
can you know move at a

840
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
a

841
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,159
you know non-constant velocity um we can

842
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
examine the acceleration profile of the

843
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,960
mouse motion so again this is that same

844
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,320
time series trajectory that we're

845
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,039
looking at from the first slide um and

846
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,120
the acceleration profiles it's really

847
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
telling so

848
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,799
with with this human motion you see that

849
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,480
kind of jitter there

850
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,200
um it's it's it's uneven lots of peaks

851
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,039
and valleys and and that's what we want

852
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,880
to see for a normal a normal human

853
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,640
interaction with with a touch pad or

854
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,480
mouse um

855
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
and then on the the machine on the right

856
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,880
again even the acceleration profile you

857
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,399
have those those really linear um

858
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
types of trajectories and and you don't

859
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,799
kind of get that the those jagged geeks

860
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,080
and balance

861
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
yeah i like you know you can definitely

862
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
see some kind of pulse on the left well

863
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,039
it's on the right

864
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,960
uh yeah there's definitely no pulse the

865
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
guys is on the live support right there

866
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,039
yeah there's signs of life on the left

867
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,960
for sure

868
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
all right um

869
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,679
now

870
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,000
so a mouse movement obviously uh you

871
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
know

872
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,880
we get a ton of those when it comes to

873
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,360
laptop and desktop devices

874
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,240
uh but now let's look at the mobile

875
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,399
world so touch event you know what do

876
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,919
you what do you get out of that is that

877
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
as rich as what we would get from a

878
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,399
mouse event

879
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,840
yeah yeah so

880
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,000
it depends you know typically with touch

881
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,159
interactions you don't have that the

882
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,799
full trajectory of of like a mouse

883
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
motion event so so with the touch

884
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,799
interaction you don't get to see where

885
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,120
that interaction began and where it

886
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,679
ended um because you just you have those

887
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,919
those single points on a screen so like

888
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,480
like with the human here on the left um

889
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,240
yeah we we don't have that trajectory

890
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,000
but you can kind of see there's there's

891
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,159
a couple points clustered together there

892
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,159
they're they're kind of smudges they're

893
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,880
they're uneven um the time won't be

894
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
constant in between these touch

895
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
interaction events um so that's what

896
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
we're kind of looking for for for human

897
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
touch events

898
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
and then on the right with a machine

899
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,480
touch profile what we would be looking

900
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,120
for just missing events altogether if

901
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,480
you say you're

902
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,360
a

903
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,159
mobile device with a touch screen um and

904
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,799
you're sending only these events as

905
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,039
mouse events you know that that will be

906
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,240
a rule that we're looking for for

907
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,360
detection

908
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,120
um and then again looking looking for

909
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
only these those those single data point

910
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,880
coordinates instead of kind of

911
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
the smudge interactions

912
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,600
right

913
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,679
yeah i mean obviously the touch event is

914
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,399
probably easier for for bots to to kind

915
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
of fake in that scenario because you

916
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
have far less to work with and

917
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,880
then your algorithm won't be as uh as

918
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,440
accurate um

919
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
so

920
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
go ahead there's even research that

921
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,399
that's trying to tie motion sensor

922
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
events like accelerometer and gyroscope

923
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,080
to these touch screen interactions to to

924
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,760
make sure they're legitimate as well so

925
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,519
so there's there's another dimension

926
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,679
that could be even taken further yeah

927
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,600
right so yeah that's a topic we want to

928
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,519
we won't touch uh too much today but

929
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,200
yeah definitely in the case of mobile

930
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,159
then potentially you have the

931
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,240
opportunity to have much richer

932
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,200
um

933
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
signals that you can work with to kind

934
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,720
of see how the user actually interact

935
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,039
you know handle this device and and then

936
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,559
to compensate for this lack of

937
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,799
interaction on the touch on the screen

938
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,720
event right

939
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
yeah okay cool now let's talk about um

940
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,760
you know keyboard like you know we all

941
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
have keyboard we all day in day out and

942
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,240
on the time of pandemics typing away at

943
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,760
our keyboard so there's probably some

944
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,279
rich interaction we can get out of that

945
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,200
so what do we collect exactly do you

946
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,440
really collect my what i'm typing or do

947
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
you collect something else

948
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,919
no no and that's a good point david and

949
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,200
we should have highlighted this early

950
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,279
this this is we don't want to collect

951
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,600
what a user is typing we we want to

952
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,399
collect

953
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,640
the the dynamics of the events but we

954
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,080
don't want the content you know and

955
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,519
that's a liability to even have the

956
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,679
content for your website like you just

957
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,960
don't want to collect that information

958
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
and it doesn't help with your purpose

959
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,559
for detection either so so so what we

960
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,360
collect with with key presses is the the

961
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
the timing of the keystroke so you know

962
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,640
how long a key is held down

963
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,200
and then the the difference between that

964
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
key press event and the next one so so

965
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,000
that that that down time in between the

966
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,639
next key and the other one and

967
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,719
you know this this is really rich that

968
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,879
just the the temporal interactions the

969
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,199
user has on their keyboard is is really

970
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,000
telling so so you can use that for

971
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,399
both bot detection whereas you know

972
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,159
a bot you know you might not even have

973
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,320
those key press events at all that that

974
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,119
information might just you know

975
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,520
automatically be entered into forms um

976
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,839
for like human fraud detection it might

977
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,320
be a very quick you might see a lot of

978
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,839
copy paste events

979
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,320
um and then like like you we touched on

980
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,879
earlier for saying user authentication

981
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,639
uh someone's typing pattern can

982
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,119
potentially be uniquely identified so

983
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,119
that's that's another point

984
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,879
yeah well i feel much better than now

985
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,480
you're not snooping on everything that

986
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,159
i'm happening over email

987
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
yeah

988
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
yeah i mean it's definitely a point that

989
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
we need to make sure that that we're

990
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,560
making uh all of this detection of

991
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,240
course has to follow uh you know

992
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,960
regulation like gdpr and ccpa in

993
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,320
california and

994
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
uh and you know where we can't we can't

995
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
collect whatever we want but we need to

996
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,800
collect enough so that we can we we are

997
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,760
able to be able to build detection

998
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,839
around

999
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,800
it um

1000
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,000
now you know okay so i mean the biggest

1001
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,160
problem that we have in the industry in

1002
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
terms of you know when we detect when we

1003
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
launch a new detection zos at the end of

1004
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,520
the day um the most common way for

1005
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,680
attackers is to do spoofing

1006
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,119
so spoofing or behavioral um sorry

1007
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,280
spoofing of device characteristics and

1008
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
the data we're collecting software

1009
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,520
through fingerprint uh fingerprinting

1010
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
with javascript it's very common i've

1011
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,680
seen that for many years do we see the

1012
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,599
same problem with uh

1013
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,760
behavioral biometrics and how do we

1014
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
handle this

1015
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,680
yeah yeah and of course for for any

1016
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
detection system you're

1017
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
the data is going to be spoofed for it

1018
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
it's it's it's just known it's just a

1019
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,839
cat and mouse game no matter what if

1020
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,800
you're looking for device

1021
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,320
characteristics the attacker is going to

1022
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,800
spoof those it's it's just it's just how

1023
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,960
it happens so yeah of course behavior

1024
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,359
biometric data gets gets spoofed um very

1025
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,079
often um and there's a lot of different

1026
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,720
ways to spoof it as well um

1027
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
probably the most common and easiest way

1028
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
to do this is to

1029
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,119
uh just just record the normal user

1030
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,520
interaction so an attacker might just

1031
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,000
you know collect their mouse events as

1032
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
they go to create an account and play

1033
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
those back into their automation system

1034
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,240
so

1035
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,760
that that's a really common and probably

1036
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,599
the easiest way to do it

1037
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,440
but but we can we can detect those

1038
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
events by looking for these type of of

1039
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,760
replay events so i'm just looking for

1040
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
that that exact same input that was um

1041
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,079
sent before you know you can detect that

1042
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,359
very easily

1043
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,839
um and then the the next stage of that

1044
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,119
would be kind of

1045
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
the attacker might modify that signal

1046
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,119
just put a little bit of noise in there

1047
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,320
for that same replay session um and

1048
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,880
again with with some filtration and kind

1049
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
of statistical techniques um that sort

1050
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,760
of replay attack can be detected as well

1051
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,599
and then there's you know on the most

1052
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,000
sophisticated side of things there's

1053
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,839
you know there's behavioral biometric

1054
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,599
systems you know

1055
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,040
you know machine learning systems that

1056
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,400
can generate mouse mouse coordinates and

1057
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
they can generate realistic keystroke

1058
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,520
like

1059
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,560
like realistic keystroke events so um it

1060
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,880
can get really sophisticated but again

1061
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,119
there has to be that that monetization

1062
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,440
incentive to do that to spend the time

1063
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,000
to implement one of those systems

1064
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,920
yeah and i guess that's you know then

1065
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
that means that we're gonna have to come

1066
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
up with something new after behavioral

1067
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,800
biometric and behavioral detection we

1068
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,119
have to come up to something new uh to

1069
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,240
be to be able to go beyond uh you know

1070
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
the fact that you know over time they're

1071
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
going to get better the attackers are

1072
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,440
going to get better at detecting all

1073
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
this uh no sorry the the replaying and

1074
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,880
uh simulating all this uh behavior that

1075
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,440
we're doing it's indefinitely increase

1076
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
the cost for the attacker so then it's

1077
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
you know but again it's uh based on the

1078
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,640
motivation uh the higher motivation the

1079
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
most likely is they're going to uh

1080
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
uh to to be able to go to go that way

1081
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,720
um but at least we are raising the bar

1082
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,680
yeah and that that's also still good

1083
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,800
overall

1084
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
yeah that that's a great point just that

1085
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,839
that monetization pro potential is is is

1086
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,040
really what what drives the

1087
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,680
sophistication yeah yeah so let's talk a

1088
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,359
little bit about the the pros of the

1089
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,200
cones of behavioral detection because it

1090
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,720
sounds very complicated it sounds very

1091
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,359
promising but it sounds very complex so

1092
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,480
tell us about you know the pros of pvr

1093
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
detection

1094
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
yeah yeah we'll start with the pros for

1095
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,880
this and in really the main benefit of

1096
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
behavioral biometrics is that they're

1097
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,040
passive that they happen

1098
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,520
naturally in the background um it's it's

1099
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,280
not a captcha that you're imposing on

1100
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,440
the user it's not additional friction

1101
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
when when a user goes to make a purchase

1102
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,920
it's it it really doesn't reduce the

1103
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
user experience at all so um that's

1104
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
that's really the main pro of them you

1105
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,400
know there's no friction

1106
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
um so so in addition to that kind of

1107
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,000
passive detection mode um

1108
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,440
another benefit is that they're they're

1109
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,760
really unique and independent from other

1110
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,599
forms of you know traditional detection

1111
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,920
that david talked about earlier it's

1112
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,839
it's it's an independent signal from

1113
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,640
like your your ip information

1114
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,040
um it's an independent signal from you

1115
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
know what whatever device that you're

1116
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,160
using um and it can really act as a you

1117
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,240
know differentiator for detection

1118
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,760
systems um

1119
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
and then another pro for for behavioral

1120
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,320
detection implementations is they're

1121
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,400
they're really hard to spoof in an

1122
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,880
intelligent way um you know you can do

1123
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,520
those simplistic replay attacks but

1124
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,599
if if you really have a good behavioral

1125
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,720
biometric system um it's the bar is

1126
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,040
pretty high for for attackers to to to

1127
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,280
really to spoof that stuff in a a

1128
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,040
complex way and they they really have to

1129
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,760
be motivated and it has to be a a system

1130
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,680
with that that monetization potential

1131
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,599
for them to to really use those the

1132
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,359
smart methods

1133
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,200
yeah definitely yeah

1134
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,920
so now let's uh let's talk about the

1135
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,200
inconvenience of behavioral biometric

1136
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,440
yeah yeah

1137
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,359
right right and it's not a perfect world

1138
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,800
so on the other side of the coin there's

1139
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,640
there's many cons to uh behavior

1140
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,280
biometric implementation um the the main

1141
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,560
one is it's uh really complex there's a

1142
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
lot of development that needs to go in

1143
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,359
up front

1144
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,040
these systems really need to be

1145
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,520
maintained like the the way you sample

1146
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,599
the data needs to be

1147
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
implemented in a smart way to begin with

1148
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,520
it needs to be maintained across you

1149
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,560
know

1150
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,480
dozens hundreds however many devices

1151
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,079
that that you're going to see across

1152
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,640
this um and then you have to be able to

1153
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,240
store that data um in an intelligent way

1154
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,040
and it's it's it's very very complicated

1155
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,720
and then once you have all that data in

1156
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,079
your database

1157
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
you're going to have to be able to

1158
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
perform computation on it you're going

1159
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,160
to have to be able to filter it to be

1160
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,319
able to find the events that you want so

1161
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,839
it's it's

1162
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,760
really data intensive computationally

1163
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
intensive

1164
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,839
um

1165
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,839
and then also on the last point um like

1166
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,440
we touched on a bit earlier there's

1167
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,359
there's privacy concerns so

1168
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,280
um initially when you're sampling this

1169
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,839
data you don't want to collect any pii

1170
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,200
information you don't want to collect

1171
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,800
these these explicit key key events and

1172
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,240
you really have to be smart about what

1173
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
data you're collecting so with all the

1174
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,319
benefits it brings there's there's a lot

1175
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,480
of uh maintenance and cons on the other

1176
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,160
side of the coin

1177
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,520
yep well it sounds like you're going to

1178
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,760
be very busy for the next uh few months

1179
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,920
or even years luke

1180
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,839
yeah

1181
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
definitely uh so one uh one aspect that

1182
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,920
you brought up earlier on is like what

1183
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
we talked about briefly is like you know

1184
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,079
in a way it's frictionless system and

1185
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
potentially it can help for user

1186
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
authentication so

1187
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,839
tell us about you know how behavioral

1188
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
detection at the end helped with user

1189
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,280
authentication

1190
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
yeah yeah good point and this is a bit

1191
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
separate from from you know bot

1192
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,119
detection and human fraud detection this

1193
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,520
is a bit of a separate avenue in itself

1194
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
but but it can also help to you know

1195
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
streamline the user experience and and

1196
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,599
you know help them not see captchas and

1197
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,760
and really make make the web experience

1198
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,560
a bit better so um the way kind of

1199
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,280
behavioral profiling works for you know

1200
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,960
when when a user has an account with a

1201
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,359
web service they'll you know interact

1202
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,319
with that account for the first time um

1203
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,680
say they're they're registering for an

1204
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,520
account and and maybe they log in for

1205
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,880
the first time

1206
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,440
um we're gonna check to see if if this

1207
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,839
user exists in the database at all

1208
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,359
did they have a profile have they

1209
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,640
collected data on them before um and if

1210
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,640
if that's not the case we're going to go

1211
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,079
on the right side of this flowchart here

1212
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
and

1213
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,119
we're going to collect data from that

1214
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,000
session and either store that in a local

1215
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,240
or remote database and then the user

1216
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,560
carries on with that transaction so the

1217
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,040
next time they they use the service or

1218
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
interact with with the website

1219
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,319
we're going to go through that same

1220
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,119
check

1221
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,560
and we'll do this

1222
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,040
a number of times until that user has

1223
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,880
enough enough data collected on them

1224
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
enough you know keystroke events until

1225
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
we know you know what time of day they

1226
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,240
usually use the service um you know what

1227
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,079
what geolocation that they typically

1228
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
come from

1229
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,200
and then once we have enough of that

1230
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,599
that rich data set um you know we can

1231
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,960
use some sort of um basic statistics or

1232
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,839
or thresholding to learn that profile

1233
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,920
and then the next time that they

1234
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
use this service we're going to run

1235
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,560
their information through that profile

1236
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,960
and then either you know authenticate or

1237
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,920
reject them or what's more likely is

1238
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
there's kind of a confidence score for

1239
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,319
that user so when that user goes into

1240
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,640
that web interaction you know it would

1241
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,119
be you know a score from 0 to 100 that

1242
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,680
you know we're 75 percent sure that that

1243
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
this is actually you interacting with

1244
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,079
this website and then other other

1245
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,079
methods like akasha could come into play

1246
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,400
or or whatever it may be

1247
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,599
right right

1248
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,599
yeah i mean if i you know what what i

1249
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,680
like about the behavioral detection

1250
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,319
overall is like you know it has it opens

1251
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,319
possibilities it has several

1252
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,880
applications that's why we wanted to

1253
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,800
kind of share this kind of use case

1254
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,200
around authentication but

1255
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,280
you know in general of course

1256
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,240
you know that the button

1257
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
overall is you know it's good for bottom

1258
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,960
human for detection uh one one thing is

1259
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,119
important to uh to remind as well is

1260
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,720
that you know basically behavioral

1261
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,480
detection on its own you know it's not

1262
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,680
typically

1263
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,400
uh you know it's a layer within a system

1264
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,920
that that you're you're deploying

1265
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
typically just having like behavioral

1266
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,720
detection on its own um may not get

1267
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,040
enough context uh to to be able to be

1268
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,200
successful so typically behavioral

1269
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,319
detection uh is deployed within a system

1270
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,839
that includes things like device

1271
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,839
intelligence that i mentioned earlier as

1272
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,440
part of some of the board detection

1273
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,560
techniques where you can learn uh what

1274
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,680
you know what

1275
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,599
what's a good

1276
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,280
what good what are good what good

1277
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,920
device document device what's your

1278
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,520
fingerprint look like in the internet

1279
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,680
ecosystem and that's evolved very very

1280
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,240
rapidly because you know every so often

1281
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,280
you got

1282
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
the google apple and the end of the

1283
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,079
world who would release new version of

1284
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,720
their product and that in it in a sense

1285
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,680
uh may constantly evolved the internal

1286
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,920
ecosystem so having a good device

1287
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,880
intelligence system um as part of the

1288
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,680
detection is is kind of a mess then as

1289
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,160
for context as well having

1290
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,800
network and ip intelligence to really

1291
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
know where the user is coming from what

1292
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,760
kind of

1293
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
networks are coming from whether it's a

1294
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,319
data center or residential or if it's a

1295
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,800
proxy or vpn or this sort of rich

1296
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,599
metadata that you can get from from ip

1297
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,200
intelligence kind of help kind of bring

1298
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,599
the context that can then be used as

1299
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,079
part of user behavior analysis so device

1300
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,640
intelligent network uh

1301
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,839
ip intelligence is and is definitely a

1302
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,800
key points used as part of user behavior

1303
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,040
analysis to be able to understand like

1304
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
based on what the user is doing and

1305
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
based on their device and based on where

1306
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,040
they are they're coming from um you know

1307
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,640
kind of make some sense about what

1308
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,880
they're doing and make a determination

1309
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,920
be

1310
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,480
between whether they're human but uh

1311
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,560
good immune or bad human so potentially

1312
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,160
bad units right

1313
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
and uh behavioral biometric as well

1314
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,240
comes in uh to to kind of you know

1315
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,880
reinforce all these signals of

1316
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,520
uh device intelligence device intel ip

1317
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,119
intel and user behavior analysis uh but

1318
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,640
of course you know all of this needs to

1319
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,040
be processed in a fairly complex way so

1320
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
that's where machine learning comes in

1321
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,520
and that's where you know luke comes in

1322
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,760
um you know and doing all the data

1323
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,640
science around it uh also some some

1324
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,119
sometimes some simple statistical model

1325
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,440
uh can actually uh you know do the trick

1326
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,760
and really help

1327
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,160
provide a good level of accuracy so it's

1328
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,560
really a system and you know here i've

1329
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,440
just

1330
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,520
highlighted a few of the methods that

1331
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
we're typically using there's always you

1332
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,079
know a few additional like

1333
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,319
you know ray control and uh you know

1334
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,079
velocity and these sort of things that

1335
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,599
that comes into play

1336
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,280
uh but of all we want to kind of bring

1337
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,760
your homes and this is

1338
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,040
a complex uh system to put together and

1339
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,319
uh

1340
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,520
yeah so that's great and uh so thank you

1341
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
luke for participating in this

1342
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,839
conversation i think we've we've learned

1343
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,240
a great deal from um

1344
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,960
behavioral detection uh today

1345
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
and with that i think we have some time

1346
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,839
to take some questions
