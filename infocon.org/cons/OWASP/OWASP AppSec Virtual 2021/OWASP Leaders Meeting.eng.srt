one location that's reviewed and updated

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,079
and it's on the website under the about

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,400
and if you the drop down arrow will come

39

down i'll say policies but a large

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,759
majority of the policies have been um

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240
updated and renewed and these are just

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
some of the ones that i know that

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,240
chapters and projects will be using or

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
handbook for leaders

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
um the chapter policy replaced the

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
handbook with the criteria and the

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,440

92
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
and this was harold

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,239
okay so i do attend a fair number of the

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,840
project committees

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
meetings

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
they meet at the pretty much

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,519
the last but generally the fourth

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,040
tuesday of every month

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
again they have their own email address

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,599
and

101
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,680
home page

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
they are currently looking at vendor

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,159
neutrality best practices uh there is a

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
draft document out and about at the

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,040
moment

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
um the reality is uh os has a very long

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,920
history of

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
vendor neutrality meaning every vendor

109
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
has the same access the same opportunity

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,238
it does not mean no vendors we do have a

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
segment of our community that are

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
against any vendors but that is not

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
realistic and realistically the best way

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
to avoid a lot of conflict is just

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
simply to accept the fact that as long

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
as every vendor has the same opportunity

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
that's where we need to land the project

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
committee is actually looking at this

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
from the point of view of projects so if

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,600
you want to be involved in that please

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
join the project committee

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
they're also working on a contributor

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
agreement which is essentially to make

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,160
sure that the code that you submit or

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
the text you submit

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
as a contributor author or

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
as a project lead you are actually

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
legally entitled to

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
give to us

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
um

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
it's i don't think it's much more than

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,120
that it's literally just making sure

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
that we're not going to get copyright

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
strikes or take down notices or anything

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
like that

136
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,759
they're also working on the project

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,600
handbook which like the chapter handbook

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
and the events in the box is a set of

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,840
really good guidance for

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,280
well-run projects so if you

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
and want to get involved please look at

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
the project handbook and

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960

expectations as to what is the best way

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
uh is it best to attach it to a upset

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,560
global is it best to have a separate

168

we're also doing marketing there's an

183
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
effort behind the scenes to improve the

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
iowa's foundation's marketing and a key

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
element of that is actually project

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
visibility we have lots of projects but

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,759
not all of them get a share of the

188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,599
limelight and we've got some real hidden

189
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,639
gems

190
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,919
so

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,720
the the main goal for us here is to

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,680
uh you know if you're interested you can

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
get into the project spotlight series

194
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
that bandana is running but if you don't

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
you want to get some marketing out there

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
for your project please contact us

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
there's also heaps of dead projects

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,479
projects that have not been worked on

199
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,560
for some time uh that may have

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
vulnerabilities or our current best

201
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
practice

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,479
in the similar way that we went through

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,199
this process with chapters the goal is

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
not to kill every single project that

205
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
has not been had a commit i mean that

206
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
would kill the os top 10 every you know

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,599
in the last year before its release

208
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
because we don't change anything really

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
for the in the last year but what we

210
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
want is more activity and more active

211
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
and vibrant projects and maybe we can

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,720
get you some more um community to help

213
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
so don't think about it as a clean up as

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,280
it is a reactivation

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
so if you are running

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
a um a project

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
or have your eyes on one that hasn't

218
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
been touched in a very long time

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,120
and you feel like you could actually

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
help please talk to us we would prefer

221
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,800
to have

222
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,680

233
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,080
found on the os website again at the top

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
of the

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,519
website page you'll see the logo on the

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
left and across the top there's um chap

237
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
the word chapter projects

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,120
and about if you click on the about

239

you'll get a menu and you'll see

240
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
committees listed there in that menu

241
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,440
one of the ones that i'll highlight here

242
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
as the education and training committee

243
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
are actually actively working on a

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
tertiary and industry curriculum

245
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
um and so if you want to learn about

246
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
that and help

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
they're very very interested and

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,399
obviously once that's done there's some

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,959
scope to work on certification we're not

250
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,560
there yet and in fact it's early days

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
for the curriculum uh adrian winkles is

252
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
talking at this conference if you've had

253
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
a chance to watch his talk

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
i think it'd be incredibly valuable uh

255
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,839
if you can help contribute to that

256
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,640
oh one last one the compliance committee

257
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
is looking for new compliance committee

258
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,519
members at the moment we've only got one

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,160
compliance committee member and fiona

260
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,399
it's not currently a very onerous duty

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
uh but it's an important one and we must

262
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
have one for whistleblowing and other

263
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
activities so

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
uh if you are interested in um

265
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
understanding more about our bylaws and

266
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
the

267
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
complaints

268
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,079
procedures and actually help make our

269
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,040
community less toxic please

270
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
reach out to fiona collins on myself and

271
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,240
i'll get you in contact with fiona

272
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
great um so here are some of the shared

273
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
services that the os foundation provides

274
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,519
to all chapters projects and committees

275
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,000
we have a meetup pro account which has

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,360
an api

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
attached to it to help connect the os

278
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,959
website to the meetup so it'll mirror

279
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,760
the

280
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
meetings that are posted on that um to

281
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
the os web page so that leaders don't

282
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
have to manually

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,959
you know populate that so

284
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,920
less data entry and they also have a new

285
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,839
coveted safety measure

286
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,839
under the manage uh

287
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,600
manager group button

288
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
which if you click on that and you start

289
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
when you're setting up your meeting if

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,360
once hopefully

291
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,399
we ever go

292
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
in person again it has a lot of um cool

293
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
features in there like you know if you

294
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800
require you know vaccinations and masks

295
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
and um that you're going to be taking

296
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,279
temperatures and stuff like that so it's

297
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
a really cool feature that they uh they

298
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,760
added with um with this uh covet

299
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
you know virus going around um

300
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,399
focused and customer friendly coming

342
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
soon

343
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,000
looking forward to that

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
um i'm actually in the process um harold

345
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
has been negotiating with streamyard

346
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
and he has also been looking at some

347
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,639
alternative services but we are very

348
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
close to signing an agreement

349
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,399
and once that happens we've got some

350
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,760
technical stuff in the background that

351
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
we need to work on

352
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
but it is our goal to get stream yard

353
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
into the hands of chapter leaders and

354
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
others who need it

355
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,600
within the next

356
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,399
well

357
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
hopefully before the end of the year

358
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,760
okay

359
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
now um i'll just uh

360
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,199
restate if you raise your hand um

361
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,120
there's a little

362
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,880
raise hand button that should be on the

363
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
bottom of your screen uh click that and

364
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
we will get to your questions in order

365
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,959
um you'll be promoted into the video and

366
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,880
your audio will become visible

367
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
i think you can stop sharing the slides

368
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,519
too and i think we'll see everybody

369
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,530
yep did that possible

370
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,040
[Music]

371
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,959
oh no

372
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,600
okay the other way you can do it is you

373
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
can just type things into the chat

374
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,639
oh we got two people so kevin um kevin

375
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,720
wall can we have kevin come up

376
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
you just have to unmute yourself kevin i

377
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
think

378
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
you can now

379
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,399
there he is

380
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
hi

381
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
yeah one of the things that i've been

382
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
asking for

383
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
um

384
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
and this actually kind of related

385
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
to the talk that i'm giving i mean

386
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
because i discuss it as one of the

387
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
things that was bad about the whole east

388
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
happy experience

389
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,880
was

390
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,399
that it's really hard to find help

391
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,000
in a specific niche area

392
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
amongst the owasp leaders

393
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,399
and i'll give you like examples i had

394
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,519
one we first went from google code

395
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,000
to and which used svn to get and github

396
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
right that was a big transition for me

397
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,079
and i'm like

398
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,320
didn't know how to do stuff and pretty

399
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,959
much everybody who knew

400
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
kind of just left

401
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,320
right so

402
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,199
that transition just worked terribly the

403
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
other thing was like we went also from

404
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
ant which i knew very well to maven

405
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,920
right another big transition i tried to

406
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,079
reach out to people how do you do

407
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,040
releases you know in maven because like

408
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,959
all the stuff that it was supposed to

409
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,519
work with the palm it wasn't working and

410
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
it took like years and years to just

411
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,720
figure out and finally dave wickers

412
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,279
figured it out for anti-sammy because he

413
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,759
took over that for a charm

414
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,800
and um

415
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
you know he was able to manage it and i

416
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
think one of the things that i would

417
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,440
love to see

418
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,199
is a place where

419
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,320
people can just volunteer to say

420
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
you know i consider myself knowledgeable

421
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
about this and i'm willing to help other

422
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,800
projects

423
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,040
with it you know so like for instance if

424
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,199
somebody needed help with cryptography i

425
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,000
would be willing to help with that right

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
because i've had a lot of experience

427
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
with the apple you know applied

428
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,639
cryptography

429
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,440
um

430
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
but like at the time i didn't know

431
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,399
anything about maven i didn't know

432
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
anything about yet i didn't know

433
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,680
anything about like how to do releases

434
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
to maven central

435
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,440
and so that's kind of where and i've

436
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,759
been asking or bringing this up like for

437
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,800
three

438
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,399
three years and it's like it's never

439
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
gone anywhere i mean it's like nobody

440
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,959
said no but it's just like

441
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,639
i don't know how to start that is that

442
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,920
like something that you do with a

443
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
committee or i mean it seems to me it's

444
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
like you just put a sign up you know

445
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,160
page on somewhere on the oauth site and

446
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,879
get people to

447
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
we actually do have a speaker's bureau

448
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,079
that we set up as just a very simple csv

449
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
file under the chapter committee i think

450
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,319
a very similar way of approaching this

451
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
would be to do a similar thing under the

452
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,280
project committee um so

453
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
let me

454
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
take that to the project committee i

455
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,199
think that's a really good idea but also

456
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
we are in the process of

457
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
you know now that we've actually

458
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
standardized what a student chapter is

459
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,960
we've got a number of new student

460
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
chapters maybe it's really worthwhile

461
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
to

462
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
have outreach from each project who's

463
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
interested in this stuff saying i need a

464
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
graduate student or i need an undergrad

465
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
who's interested in xyz um can you that

466
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,080
would be awesome that would be awesome

467
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
too because i mean i mean we definitely

468
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
we have three people

469
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,919
that try to keep

470
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,320
ethappy chugging along and

471
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
and you know and it's like i don't know

472
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,200
if you knew i'm not trying to complain

473
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,039
but like

474
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
my son got hit by a car

475
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,000
back in

476
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
in in september and that's kind of like

477
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,080
been my full-time focus trying to get

478
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
him you know well

479
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,919
and so

480
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,520
so the other one that i'd actually say

481
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,919
is if it's something that you're deeply

482
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,360
passionate about

483
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,720
project leaders we are looking at grants

484
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
and so what you like to do

485
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
is say i need to do x y and z i think if

486
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
i could get x amount of funding for this

487
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
i could work on this full time and this

488
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,880
is the result

489
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,280
that's under the grants policy

490
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
please work with harold because we

491
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,559
definitely need a list that we can shop

492
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,320
around when we do fundraising with our

493
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,000
corporate members and others

494
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
um we don't have any list at the moment

495
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,360
to say

496
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
zappy is looking for a three-month

497
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
sabbatical and it could be funded for

498
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,480
this amount of money

499
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,919
okay

500
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,300
um

501
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,480
[Music]

502
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,960
i don't see any other hands that's all i

503
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440

okay other other questions

506
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,799
because otherwise i'm going to talk

507
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,600
about expenses

508
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320

510
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
is that you who's the os foundation well

511
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,840
it's normally done

512
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,320

513
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160

515
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
is it doing

516
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
yet i just raised my hand because no one

517
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,240
did to see if it was working because

518
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,039
when you were saying no one was doing it

519
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,080
yeah

520
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
that so i raised my hand to make sure it

521
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,840
was working

522
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,039

523
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,280

or do you shall we tell you i was just

525
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,320
thinking of what they said before about

526
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,000
students and stuff

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
since lisa's opened so many student

528
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
chapters you can actually email the

529
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,360
chapter on meetup and see if it gets any

530
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,400
response until you get the list

531
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
together

532
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
if they wanted to reach out you know

533
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,840
since they're all on the meetup page

534
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,159
on the dashboard you can look up student

535
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,760
chapters and

536
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,360
reach out that way until you get the

537
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,559

538
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,919

545
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,280

546
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
dawn do you want to just describe what

547
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,480

548
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,039

549
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,960
uh since we have the 20th anniversary

550
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
we'll keep up till the end of the year

551
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
uh we have some bait you know the

552
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
standard logos on a lot of different

553
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
merchandise

554
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,919
so what i'm trying to do i've reached

555
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,120
out because i'm

556
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,919
the contact person for the dia committee

557
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,840
we're going to do a logo for that and

558
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
i'm trying to look at some not the

559
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
standard logos almost

560
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,679
if some people haven't seen like the def

561
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,320
con ones we did years ago some with

562
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,240
colors somewhat pop some different

563
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,360
things

564
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
i'm willing to do merchandise for

565
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,240
projects but all logos have to have the

566
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,799
word oh wasp on it somewhere or the wasp

567
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,440
i can't just you know some of the

568
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,919
previous ones don't have os on it so i

569
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,840
will put it on zazzle

570
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
and people can purchase it and people

571
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,240
when you go on zazzle if you're

572
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
interested in purchase something they

573
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
always have a discount code so look for

574
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
the discount code

575
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
they always have one

576
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,880
but anyone who's interested in wants to

577
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,760
see something on merchandise just email

578
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
me give me some ideas if you have a logo

579
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,440
send it to me or we're going to start in

580
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
january

581
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
uh doing some new logos so

582
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,039
you know some fun you know

583
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,840
maybe short term or different things i'm

584
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,080
asking them to come up with a standard

585
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
chapter logo

586
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,080
and so lisa did one with a globe which

587
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,440
was pretty cool

588
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
so we're going to work around that but

589
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,559
any suggestions anything your general

590
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
projects harold's fiddling around with

591
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
some stuff

592
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,880
i'm all ears just email me and we can

593
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,039
have a ton of different things up

594
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,720
excellent

595
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
we're also looking in the operating plan

596
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,120
for next year to actually address

597
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,000
the very heavily requested

598
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
chat to swag

599
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,080
you don't need to

600
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
hand out swag to get people to come to

601
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
your meetings

602
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,039
what we want to do is actually come up

603
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,679
with some guidelines and the best way

604
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,720
with the chapter committee on addressing

605
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
the desired need for

606
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
merchandise

607
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
now

608
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
it doesn't make sense to give everyone

609
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
free hoodies

610
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
but it does make sense to give away free

611
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,919
stickers and

612
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,919
um

613
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,120
yeah

614
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,799
we're just trying to figure it out so if

615
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,720
you're interested in helping

616
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,159
how do we do this

617
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,600
please come to the chapter committee

618
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
meetings because i think that's probably

619
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,880
the best place to discuss it

620
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,240
and also if you have any suggestions for

621
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
types of merchandise that we can sell

622
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,240
that you think would be a good seller

623
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,760
for owasps

624
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,400
um reach out to me

625
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
and we can come up with some things

626
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
andrew do you want to talk in this i

627
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,400
don't can't answer the questions about

628
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,360
books

629
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,520
for lean uh

630
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
putting you know like the projects

631
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,760
that people put books up

632
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,039
for selling

633
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,480
yeah so

634
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,039
um if you're a project leader who's

635
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,760
doing documentation like the asvs the

636
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
top 10 and others

637
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,559
um

638
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,360
we have lean pub available to us we're

639
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
trying to do a test run at the moment

640
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,120
if

641
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
it's really

642
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
interesting i try putting up the asvs

643
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
403

644
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
but it's really pinnicky about image

645
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,840
formats so we might need some assistance

646
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,440
with someone who's got a bit more time

647
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
than myself uh in how do we generate the

648
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,679
images correctly to get it published

649
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
through lean pub

650
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,400
so for kevin kevin's asked

651
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,919
speaking of merchandise how about

652
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520

654
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,360

659
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,279
because the united states postal service

660
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
will not take pins

661
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
in a standard envelope

662
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,919

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,159
too

680
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,399
yay

681
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,440
so

682
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,120
uh if you can arm me that'd be awesome

683
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,880
oh there you go excellent i didn't

684
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,559
realize i needed to become a panelist in

685
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,320
order to do this

686
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
right uh yeah i'm with the portland

687
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,039
chapter and um we're putting we're

688
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,480
cooperating with some other chapters to

689
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
put on a um

690
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
an apsec conference for the pacific

691
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,480
northwest we did a first run of that in

692
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,360
june

693
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,840
um and

694
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,960
uh there are people on the co on the

695
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
committees who know a lot more about it

696
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
than i do so it's uh you're not my only

697
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,159
lifeline here but as long as i had your

698
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,080
attention i thought i would ask what

699
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
should i know if i'm planning an oasp

700
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
event where should i look is there an

701
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,039
events committee an events project guide

702
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,840
obviously expenses policy i i heard that

703
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
yeah so thank you for the excellent

704
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,640
segue we just renewed our events policy

705
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,120
there is an events town hall on

706
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
november 30 that i think you and your

707
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,279
team should definitely come there's

708
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,279
actually in three different time zones

709
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
um we need to explain what the new

710
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
events policy does one of the things it

711
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
does is that event leaders are leaders

712
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,559
in their own right you don't have to be

713
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,840
a chapter leader you don't have to be a

714
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
project leader

715
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,679
the other part of it is that it clearly

716
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,720
explains that the budgeting process now

717
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
we as a foundation need to come up with

718
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
some better budgeting tools

719
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
because we get all sorts of interesting

720
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,360
budgets some of which are very very

721
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,679
rubbery

722
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,880
and

723
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,320
one of the things about the new expense

724
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,559
policy is you can have a a regional

725
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,600
event that literally makes no money you

726
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,840
can make one cent and we'll approve it

727
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,360
but you need to have a budget to prove

728
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,320
that you'll make one cent

729
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
the the reason for this is we

730
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,880
are very limited budget for the next

731
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
couple of years

732
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,399
we're doing better than we expected now

733
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,039
but not so much that i'm gonna unleash

734
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,159
the taps

735
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,159
so our expenses policy is along the

736
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
lines of if you had it written down in

737
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
your budget you can expense it

738
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,880
um

739
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
but fundamentally

740
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,640
the other parts of the new expense

741
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
policy is we've got revised trainer

742
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,399
splits it's much fairer to both the

743
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,000
trainer but also the event organizers so

744
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,840
if you're trying to do something along

745
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
the lines of

746
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,399
fundraise for your local chapter

747
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,940
you can actually um

748
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,120
[Music]

749
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,799
you'll you'll be better off is what i'm

750
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,880
trying to say

751
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,640
the second part of that is it talks

752
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
about the ways that you can use that

753
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,480
money so part of the problem with the

754
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
irs is we need to move money into our

755
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
mission it can't just sit in our bank

756
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,799
account

757
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,200
and previously we would have probably

758
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,760
failed an irs compliance order not a

759
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,240
financial audit we keep on passing those

760
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
with flying colors

761
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,960
what we

762
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
weren't good at was spending our money

763
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,880
on mission so

764
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
the events policy is now aligned with

765
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,399
that so the event organizers get to

766
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,799
choose how the money is spent

767
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,120
but what won't happen is the money

768
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,200
sticking around

769
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
so if you're interested before the town

770
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
hall please go and read the events

771
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
policy um the events team uh kelly and

772
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,159
lauren

773
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:42,880
are

774
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
extraordinary busy today and tomorrow

775
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,880
and they've got a training session next

776
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,559
week so please give them a little bit of

777
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,799
leeway to answer any questions but if

778
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,240
you do have any questions they're the

779
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,399
right people to ask

780
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,720
lastly we are interested in having an

781
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,559
events committee it's just that when

782
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
i've asked for participation before no

783
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
one stepped up so if your team is

784
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
actually interested we just need three

785
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,600
os members to establish a committee

786
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
put a charter up

787
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,600
and then we can take it to the board i

788
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
would love to see an events committee

789
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,320
because we have so many tremendous

790
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,559
events all around the world and i do

791
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,440
believe

792
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
that

793
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,799
it would be ideal to have events

794
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,480
represented with their own committee

795
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,000
oh i think we got harold

796
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
hello mr harold

797
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,440
okay so brian i hope that answered your

798
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
question um but if it doesn't please do

799
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,279

800

30. it'll be held at

801
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,760
three different time zones so that we

802
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,919
cover all of the major places around the

803
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,000
world the only sort of if you're in the

804
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,320
marianas probably not so much but it

805
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,360
should work for everyone

806
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,559
okay um

807
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,120
i'm just looking oh this one new message

808
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,799
yep thank you brian

809
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,159

um

811
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,600
so a new message we are just about out

of time okay that's fine um

813

so the last part is yes we have done a

814
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
lot of reform of a lot of policies these

815
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
last 18 months

816
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,840
to

817
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,679
center our activities around the

818
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,799
community

819
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,039
and i want to see that continue we have

820
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,720
a few policies which haven't been looked

821
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,279
at yet but we will do them next year i

822
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,720
want to make sure that our policies are

823
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,480
fresh relevant and community focused so

824
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,000
if you are interested in doing that

825
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
please do

826
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,159

going to be running we are here for the

832
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,159

goes wrong and it's on fire

841
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,120
he tries to put the fire out

842
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,480
but he's primarily yeah

843
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,320
he's it

844
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,559
but his primary job is to assist project

845
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,039
leaders so as a project leader if you're

846

if you want to learn more about what it

883
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,080
actually involves

884
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,320
pretty much you come to a meeting once a

885
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,279
month do some work between the meetings

886
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,240
and

887
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
try to encourage people to hold more

888
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
active and greater and more vibrant

889
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,399
meetings

890
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
one quick last question

891
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,880
since

892
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,399
we've ran the last two um

893
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,120
you know global app sex

894
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
virtually

895
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,039
are we considering when the next time

896
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,600
when we start like meeting you know in

897
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,440
person to also hold a virtual component

898
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,080
along with it so that the people who

899
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
can't like afford to like say fly from

900
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,279
europe or whatever still can participate

901
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,760
yeah our plan is because we're expecting

902
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
cobra to still be around as an endemic

903
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,840
issue for some time we'll have um

904
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,120
hybrid approach to our global events

905
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,679
um i don't think i don't know that we

906
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,440
will have hybrid

907
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,799
uh speakers

908
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,360
uh that is up to the events team right

909
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
now yeah but i meant the the

910
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,159
participation i think we could draw in

911
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
extra people i mean i know just like for

912
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,120
some people it's cost prohibitive like

913
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,799
to fly from europe

914
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,200
or you know asia or wherever to the

915
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,399
united states if they want to

916
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,360
participate yep so

917
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,359
so just very briefly we're actually

918
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,199
holding in-person events in dublin and

919
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,599
san francisco next year and it is a

920
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,159
really good point um about hybrid

921
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,239
attendance some people can't travel

922
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,000
because they don't meet the requirements

923
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,040
of

924
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,359
the us government or the eu

925
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,000
to enter and we don't want to stop them

926
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,040
participating just because

927
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
of whatever reason but also yeah

928
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,280
absolutely part of our job is to make

929
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,040
sure everyone can afford

930
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,918
our events so um i think that's a really

931
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,599
good point i'll bring it up with kelly

932
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,560
and hopefully she can touch on it at the

933
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,119
events town hall okay excellent thanks
