[Music]

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,279
and let me give you the background on

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,800
this particular one this is absent

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,559
champions and

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,080
uh when the pandemic started last year

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,400
we had gone through this process of of

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
you know really transitioning to zoom

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
calls and not travel

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,599
and we were we we just rolled off of rsa

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,160
2021

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
and i think black hat had been canceled

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
in person so this is like late spring

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
early summer and we're just trying to

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,200
think of things to do that were

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
interesting intellectually and

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,800
uh

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
this was one of the things that came out

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
of that it was an idea that uh

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,680
that absent champions which we had known

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
and seen and and experienced and worked

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
with

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,640
numerous

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,239
companies on this

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,920
had never the whole concept had never

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
really been measured in any way

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
and that even though these this whole

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
concept of a champions program was a

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,559
thing

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
nobody had ever quantified the numbers

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
so this was an idea to do that

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
uh and i'll go i'll give you the quick

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
background of what we did and it was a

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,080
tremendous lift it took the better part

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
of last year and up to this spring

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
and uh

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
and it will you know for those that are

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,360
appstick people managers this is real

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
real stuff uh that can help well my

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
background uh absec person forever i've

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
been in the business for about 22 years

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
and probably primarily what i do is i

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,600
help

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
appsec managers with these programs and

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
i'm an advisor

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,759
on software risk for sizzos and csos

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,600
that's primarily what i do

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,400
the vast majority of sizzos are not

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
developers or absent people by

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
background so i ended up being that

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
translation layer

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,439
between the hardcore osmonapsec

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,640
you know energies and activities to

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,439
a less technical non-developer

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,360
leadership so making the business case

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,000
for this stuff so do a lot of speaking

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
and this was the project that we ended

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
up doing i said this is a cool one i

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
also did a for two or three years in a

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
row

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,360
a a surveys on developers and the impact

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
of training and presented those at

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,959
numerous uh appsec usas uh probably now

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
about six or seven years ago so i did uh

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,239
developer surveys on the impact of

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
of uh you know a

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
a security class and on their you know

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
ability to

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,560
to write more secure code so let me talk

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,920
about the the survey itself as i

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
mentioned it was something that we came

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,959
up with

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,480
and it became a thing it became a big

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
deal we way underestimated how much time

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
and energy was put into this

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
my original

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
background in my original undergraduate

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
degree was political science so i had a

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
at least a technical bent from a survey

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
and questionnaire standpoint and how to

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,360
collect data i'm also an mba person so

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
you know

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
technical in a from a business

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
standpoint and from a number crunching

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,920
standpoint and knew how to develop a

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
hypothesis and questions that could be

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
measured so i'll talk about today is the

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,000
survey itself

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
the questions that i asked and how i

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,519
asked them

90
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,200
the preliminary results or the results

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,959
that they came out of study and then

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,640
leave enough time for questions and

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,519
answers i hope

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,360
so the first thing i did is we we did

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
what's called a structured a research

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,239
approach

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,799
which involved a set of interviews

98
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,040
because i recognized

99
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,879
that that you know yes you could send

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
out a

101
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,280
you know a survey monkey and get certain

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
sets of data back which were interesting

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
but

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
given the early stage nature and kind of

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
the emerging stage nature of uh aztec

106
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,799
champions that maybe some of the more

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,200
interesting observations would be

108
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,680
from follow-on questions so

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
what i ended up doing is having a series

110
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
of interviews and really picking

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,599
the the programs

112
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
was part of it because i wanted to not

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
get sample bias and so i'll talk about

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
that a bit

115
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
but we wanted to really capture the best

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,959
practices stuff that we saw in the field

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
the common practices

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,280
identify some of the common challenges

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
things that people experience and put

120
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,799
numbers to that

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
and then trying to see if there's any

122
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
commonalities out there around

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
you know pipelines cloud security

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,680
demands like the organization itself

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
and uh you know so what we ended up

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
doing is we focused on

127
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
people their apsec managers people that

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
are program owners

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
subject matter experts

130
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,479
and

131
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
regardless of their title regardless of

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
their role and that was a starting point

133
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
like people that knew this stuff that

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
had a program so so if they didn't have

135
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
a program we threw them out

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
or one it was very interesting if they

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
called it a napstick champions program

138
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
was a glorified developer training

139
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,919
program we threw that out too so

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
you know perhaps the starting point for

141
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
the the discussion is an absolute

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
champions program itself is the use of a

143
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,479
centralized security team

144
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
typically reporting to the security

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
organization

146
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
that is using concepts of influence and

147
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
managerial leverage to influence a much

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,919
larger

149
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
development team that doesn't report to

150
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
them so absent of formal kind of uh

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
command and control as they say

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
not ability to compel them to do a lot

153
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,039
but the use of a you know a small

154
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,919
tight knit team to influence lots more

155
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,720
people so what i end up doing

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
is uh having several interviews teeing

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
it up getting the business justification

158
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
getting them to participate because

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
here's the other thing if you deal with

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
big companies not all of them want to

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,039
share data any data you know so

162
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
we had a few that were very interested

163
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
to be great members i probably talked to

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
50 companies

165
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
i ended up getting 26

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
that i got i went through this whole

167
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
drill with but like there was a lot of

168
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
people that didn't you know they

169
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
couldn't get corporate now they're ciso

170
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,800
or couldn't get corporate pr to do this

171
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
so they their corporate policy wasn't to

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
participate

173
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,960
so

174
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
again the output would be a research

175
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
report and a published white paper which

176
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
i've got

177
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
a final draft of and that's one of the

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
things that if you're interested in this

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
topic

180
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
i'm publishing that in the next 30 days

181
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,039
so um

182
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,319
the background is i had it mostly done

183
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
in the spring after working on it all

184
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
last year i did the writing and

185
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
iterations and then we got bought out by

186
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
coal fire denim group did and the

187
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,759
marketing folks were like wait a second

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,319
this is kind of cool to send out so they

189
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,440
put it on their marketing um uh you know

190
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
dock it and embargoed it and here we are

191
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,759
it's november so like anxious to get it

192
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
out but it's pretty cool you like it if

193
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
you're interested so

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
so the candidates for the survey like

195
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
again you know given the bias of sample

196
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,800
sampling i wanted to focus on a few

197
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
common attributes for the starting point

198
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
again they had a full-time application

199
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
security staff you know regardless of

200
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
what their job titles were they had

201
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
somebody

202
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
that managed the risk of software

203
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,599
full-time and that that throws a lot of

204
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
companies out and i said as i mentioned

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,599
earlier we did 26 that were either

206
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,560
building at the earlier stages are built

207
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,479
if i if i got people that were thinking

208
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,880
about it everything would be zeros uh so

209
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
there were a few in there that were at

210
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
earlier stages

211
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
the industries represented as you might

212
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
imagine

213
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
are some of the larger ones that had

214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
complex

215
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
development efforts they had lots and

216
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,639
lots of teams

217
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
that probably regulated certainly had

218
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
supply chain pressures so that's the

219
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
pharma's banks tech telecom

220
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,759
financial services no public sector so

221
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
no governments

222
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
um not a really small medium-sized

223
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,160
business the smaller companies

224
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,879
probably more sass and you know had more

225
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
of a sass or like fintech flavor to them

226
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,720
if that makes sense they they didn't

227
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
have

228
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,000
10 000 seats or 10 000 people but they

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
were

230
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
super paranoid because that's what they

231
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,400
did so over 50 of the the 26 had 10 000

232
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
seats or above so these are big pro you

233
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
know at big abstech programs where the

234
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
use case probably is

235
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
five or six or seven uh apsec people

236
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
um you know

237
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,039
and then thousands of developers so one

238
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
of the questions i ask i'll get to is

239
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,039
what's that ratio between the two

240
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,400
because i thought that was interesting

241
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,919
so that's the background of the

242
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
candidates for the survey as i mentioned

243
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
i had to get to talk about 50 to get to

244
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
26 and um

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,840
as i mentioned there's a few in there

246
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
that you know i'm like very promising

247
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,039
candidates that were like oh wait a

248
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
second that's just a

249
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,039
trading program uh and they didn't have

250
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
any other components of apps like

251
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,000
champion stuff

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
so i asked four types of questions

253
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,958
and again like when you go in to do one

254
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,919
of these things you have certain

255
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
hypotheses and certain

256
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
um ideas and given that i've been in

257
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
apps that can work with companies and

258
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
programs i had you know this was not the

259
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
first time i'd done this i had some idea

260
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
um some of the questions turned out to

261
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,320
be more interesting uh the responses

262
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,519
turned out to be more interesting than

263
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,959
others but the first set of questions

264
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
around the organizations itself you know

265
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,880
more than how many devs how many apps

266
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,959
people how many teams

267
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,160
you know where do they kind of think

268
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
they were maturity wise

269
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
you know on on a kind of bastardized

270
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,600
cmmi schedule you know uh uh

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
you know maturity level uh also about

272
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
about environments about how many you

273
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
know had pipelines and cloud you know

274
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
how many were having their apps uh

275
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
resident in the cloud or you know like

276
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
look more traditional on-prem

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
i asked two questions about times time

278
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
how long did these programs take to

279
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
build how long have they been in place

280
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
and i got some interesting answers there

281
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,279
that i didn't anticipate to be quite

282
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,160
candid

283
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
i asked about program attributes itself

284
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,360
did they have a mandate did this did it

285
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,120
look like

286
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,080
the

287
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
trusted computing memo from bill gates

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,240
over 20 years ago where bill gates woke

289
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
up one day and said thou shalt write

290
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
software more securely

291
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
or did it come up organically from the

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
development team as a comparison were

293
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,120
there standards in place how did these

294
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
organizations recruit abstech champions

295
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
for the dev teams was their training and

296
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
tools and again this is interesting

297
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,079
because in order to accrue the value

298
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,600
of scale and again we're talking

299
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
scalability leverage here because

300
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,440
you have a handful of people trying to

301
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
influence potentially thousands without

302
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
that proper set of tools and

303
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
documentation

304
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
it's all an anecdote

305
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,399
and so i asked questions around then and

306
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,160
then around that and then i asked two

307
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
questions around roi that were very

308
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,200
simple and broad you know are you

309
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
achieving results and if so how do you

310
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
measure those results in an roi fashion

311
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
the thing that came out of this is most

312
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
certainly there is

313
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
uh you know areas for future research

314
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
and additional questions and there is

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,480
some sense that we'll probably end up

316
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
doing this again because there's just so

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
much left on the table and i'll get that

318
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
sense hopefully in the questions and

319
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,360
answers they'll come out

320
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
um so

321
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
this is an interesting one the first

322
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,600
question i asked around organizational

323
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,959
background was like how do you

324
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,640
characterize your asset champions

325
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
program and i

326
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
gave some attributes of this

327
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
and one of them i asked was you know

328
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,519
like like do you consider yourself

329
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
mature you know maturing and they're you

330
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
know like like are you doing regular

331
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
scanning if you looked at like a bsim or

332
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
open sam or do you feel like you are

333
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
have you done that at all

334
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
um so i gave some broad you know

335
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
editorial discretion here and um and in

336
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
these questions if they

337
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
told me that they looked a particular

338
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,480
way and then the rest of the responses

339
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
didn't look that way i would go back and

340
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
double back like if they said oh yeah

341
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,079
we're optimizing and they're using like

342
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,040
one

343
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,360
uh dash scanner and not doing anything

344
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
else no threat modeling no requirements

345
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,279
no about you know no

346
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,519
uh so i there's you know some sanity

347
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
there so that was the first thing um

348
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
so the average most of people said they

349
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
were maturing uh some of the newer ones

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,279
said they're emerging as you might

351
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,279
imagine there were only two or three i

352
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,880
think in the whole

353
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
survey that said they were mature there

354
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
was none above that so interesting

355
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
okay so here's the numbers that came out

356
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
from the the 26 companies how many

357
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
developers do you have average the mean

358
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,920
was about 1600 which is a number that

359
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
really doesn't mean a lot right because

360
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
there's a lot of variants it's like

361
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
there's lots so thousands

362
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,160
in this case in nearly two thousand

363
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
so but a picture is starting to merge

364
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,079
here how many abstech staff do you

365
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,720
typically have 13 and then that

366
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
if you look at the small organizations

367
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,519
it's like okay the use case of a handful

368
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
of apsec people that hundreds or

369
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
thousands of dollars started to come out

370
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,399
from this

371
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
the other one i asked that really was

372
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
almost a not a throwaway question but

373
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
like didn't really have any meetings how

374
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
many champions did you have this was all

375
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,560
over the place depending on how

376
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,399
you know how they allocated them across

377
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,639
teams so it didn't really tell me much

378
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,399
and probably

379
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
begs further analysis i did ask how many

380
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
dev teams they had in general

381
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,800
and what i came to find out is sure

382
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
enough there's like cross matrices and

383
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
double counting problems so i just threw

384
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
that one out as a it just didn't strike

385
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,760
me as interesting but the thing that did

386
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,920
was in the programs

387
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
that self-identified as mature they had

388
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
a one to fifty

389
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,680
absec person to develop a ratio

390
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
and if you throw in the maturing ones

391
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,160
that goes to one one to 150 to one to

392
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,519
100

393
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,120
and then after that it was all over the

394
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,680
place right but like the mature maturing

395
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
programs were quite interesting the ones

396
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,760
that looked had other attributes of

397
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,040
goodness

398
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
and my understanding is that does track

399
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,120
with what the guys at synopsis have seen

400
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
in their bsim question so this is pretty

401
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
cool so that's a a key finding that

402
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
comes out in the report is like hey it's

403
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,680
one to 50. you know it's a number

404
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
um that is one that i want to do again

405
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
because that that jumped out and i

406
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,519
didn't expect that to be as cool as it

407
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,480
was

408
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
okay so we looked at other aspects of

409
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
testing to infer sophistication too

410
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
um

411
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
we asked you know like what kind of

412
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
tools and

413
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
tool sets did they ask uh we asked how

414
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
many apps were built in pipelines or

415
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
distributed i just built and distributed

416
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,720
pipelines so

417
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,240
about 61 said over half so but that was

418
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,760
almost all of them said of course that's

419
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,199
moving that way

420
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,600
um interesting the the the people that

421
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,199
were pretty much

422
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,279
uh more traditional certainly as it

423
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
related to cloud were the on-prem the

424
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
bigger on-prem financial banks the big

425
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
banks

426
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
but this is certainly going towards um

427
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,199
you know the the as you might imagine

428
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,519
pipelines in in in the cloud at what

429
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,959
percentage of your apps were hosted in

430
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
the cloud was divided

431
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,519
um 38 over said over 90. so that's an

432
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,480
example

433
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
but the key finding that jumped out of

434
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
this is everybody that said that they

435
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
were mature

436
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
uh had all three

437
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,920
types of major testing uh technologies

438
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,079
and a lot of them had i asked too so i

439
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,000
don't get an email from the guys at

440
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
contrast and so to type in different

441
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
places like that it was the key point

442
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
here as as analysts and others have said

443
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
is you you to really infer truth you

444
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
have to have

445
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
two or three types of technology

446
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,079
certainly sas and das probably sca even

447
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,800
better with i asked um and then and then

448
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,199
go from there so that that bore out in

449
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,360
these numbers is the mature ones had

450
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
that

451
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
and um

452
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
and that was one of the key findings

453
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
that came out so

454
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,800
all right

455
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
uh so here is an area that i asked

456
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,279
around

457
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,040
uh the time

458
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,199
how long did it take to build these

459
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
programs

460
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
and

461
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,839
about

462
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,000
like it's somewhere between

463
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
a year about half of instead about a

464
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
year up to a year

465
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,519
um and then about 20 said one plus year

466
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,480
uh and it's all over the place but it's

467
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
safe to say to get if you start tomorrow

468
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
it's at least a year and probably a year

469
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
to two years uh realistically to have

470
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,759
coverage across the teams

471
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,639
to

472
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
have material

473
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,639
impact and feedback from the teams

474
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,199
and uh but so that's about a you know a

475
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
year now the interesting one

476
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
uh i asked the next question well wait

477
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
and probably i probably should ask the

478
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
other one first i said like how long

479
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,279
have these programs been in place

480
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
sure enough we had a few that have been

481
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
out there in the fintech and financial

482
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,680
area

483
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,759
for over four years and it had multiple

484
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
iterations

485
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,519
uh that you know the majority were

486
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
somewhere in there two to three years or

487
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,639
a year

488
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,440
but

489
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,639
a good 27 said n a what that really was

490
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
was they didn't know

491
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,199
and uh so that's reflective of

492
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,040
substantial turnover

493
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
as you might imagine as you probably

494
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
have experienced anecdotally um

495
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
substantial pr progress uh excuse me

496
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,800
turnover from from developers and appsec

497
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
people they just didn't know the other

498
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
thing that came out as a secondary

499
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
question that i didn't anticipate here

500
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
and i included in the report

501
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,679
was about the issue about

502
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,079
uh programs that's that

503
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,400
had complete resets

504
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,079
um and just a little bit of a sidebar

505
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,000
here when i mean complete reset where

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
they were off and running for two years

507
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,799
and then had a key person leave or had a

508
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
leadership focus change or i mean who

509
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,919
knows maybe even a security incident

510
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
but they completely

511
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
lost somebody and it was a do-over

512
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
my assumption going in was that these

513
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
things always were going to be growing

514
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
and doing better and expanding and

515
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,559
having depth of coverage and that is in

516
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
fact not the case

517
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,000
in a in a big chunk of the organizations

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
they have total reset so that's

519
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
in the report itself i put a a little

520
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
aside to managers like these take care

521
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,679
and feeding like don't assume that

522
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,720
they'll have

523
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,320
organizational momentum so just an fyi

524
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
so another interesting thing you know

525
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
going in a hypothesis was that these

526
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,400
things kind of happen organically you

527
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,039
know the bill gates memo is an example

528
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,919
where

529
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,480
uh maybe not so much where he had strong

530
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,280
like hierarchical or down you know chain

531
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
of command guidance

532
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
but not so much in this

533
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
in the report

534
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,960
um the at least two-thirds said they had

535
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,400
nothing or

536
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
uh they had the sizzle mandate well i

537
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
mean like let's be candid if you don't

538
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,520
have the sizzle mandate you don't have

539
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
anything so like that's almost a you

540
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
know like a existential yes of course we

541
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
have the this is a mandate but the point

542
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,440
here is that most of them happen

543
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
organically

544
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,039
ironically these uh organizations have

545
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,200
these you know very smart technical

546
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
leaders who become

547
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
you know hacked the organization from

548
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,520
within and and grew it at these programs

549
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,440
with in many instances

550
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
very little

551
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
uh managerial oversight with very little

552
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
investment and certainly with little or

553
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,480
no uh mandate formal mandate so that's

554
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
pretty cool like they become a thing

555
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
uh without it you know being a thing at

556
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,320
the ceo cfo ceo level and i did ask that

557
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
question i think we only had one that

558
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
had um

559
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,799
the co the rest were the cto

560
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,400
okay that's that's now we're talking

561
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
this is where the development lived in

562
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
that organization but i think there was

563
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,919
only one that had cfo

564
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,720
cto excuse me cfo

565
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,679
co or ceo there were none that had ceo

566
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,440
so this is an important thing to

567
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
recognize somewhere in the in your

568
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,840
journey you have to have that you know

569
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
if you don't get it you should go back

570
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
two years into it trying to get it so

571
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
just a little aside

572
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
some other program

573
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,360
attributes do you have defined roles in

574
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,039
standards i asked that question and you

575
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,400
know majority said they did but it was

576
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
kind of i was expecting higher in that

577
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
62 percent they said

578
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,919
and the question there is like if you

579
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,200
don't have defined roles and standards

580
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
how do you scale this program how do you

581
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
communicate across all the dev teams is

582
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,880
it tribal knowledge is it conversation

583
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,720
is it oral history like like how do you

584
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
do that

585
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
uh the other thing is i asked the

586
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,240
question like how did you recruit and uh

587
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
the the majority there it's i sussed

588
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,240
this out in the report but we're

589
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
volunteered and voluntold

590
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
the assumption here is that the best way

591
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,799
to do this is to have them

592
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,000
volunteer

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,799
to be

594
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,840
bought in and not be told you know uh

595
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,640
but between those two that largely is

596
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
the way you recruit the preference by

597
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
far is volunteered if you uh there's a

598
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,679
whole series of discussions and i think

599
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,280
one of my colleagues presented on how

600
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,120
you build and recruit

601
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
i didn't get to see that but i'm going

602
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,840
to

603
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,600
and then you have a format for formal

604
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
training like is there an approach like

605
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
the majority didn't nor did they have

606
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
actual rewards programs and this is when

607
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
i say rewards i mean

608
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
you know a formal recognition program

609
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,480
broadly so if you don't have a formal

610
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
training program again how do you scale

611
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
how do you do it

612
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
that that was a little bit surprising

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
the rewards one is an opportunity missed

614
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
i would say and rewards doesn't mean

615
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
purely monetary or recognition but the

616
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,000
more sophisticated organizations did in

617
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,679
fact make it into

618
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,559
uh

619
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,720
into their performance management system

620
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
you know into their ratings as as

621
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,080
attributes

622
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,799
they also did formalize recognition even

623
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,960
if it wasn't monetary like

624
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
uh through peer recognition through

625
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
whatever just like hey great job dude

626
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
gamification

627
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,679
uh

628
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,919
that's a that's a i think a table stake

629
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,840
to be quite candid and probably further

630
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,720
you know

631
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
a a an opportunity for further

632
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,559
discussion and analysis

633
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
okay so how frequently did these leaders

634
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,039
the absence leaders communicate with

635
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
their champions most were constantly

636
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,320
most

637
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
and then at a minimum monthly right so

638
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,799
it was interesting because we asked this

639
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,799
question a lot of it's ad hoc too and

640
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
you can say well okay we used uh slack

641
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
okay of course everybody use slack or or

642
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,799
the equivalent slacker teams right

643
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,600
but

644
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,480
um

645
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
you know so 64 you slacking teams some

646
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,039
had some pretty cool portals that they

647
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,720
used um

648
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
you know so the gamification stuff uh

649
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
some of them use some of the platforms

650
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,559
that you might imagine the typical

651
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,200
tooling that help provide visibility

652
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,480
across the teams

653
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,320
but the interesting thing that that came

654
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,159
out of this that's in the report that i

655
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,320
didn't really capture in this uh

656
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,760
presentation was

657
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,280
a recognition that you have to have

658
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,640
slack in teams for kind of the

659
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
day-to-day chatter but that doesn't

660
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
substitute a formal

661
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
communication strategy to the to the

662
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,240
masses so

663
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,559
almost all of them used slacking teams

664
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,720
for day-to-day chatter and back and

665
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
forth and more direct guidance

666
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
but that was complemented by either a

667
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,799
monthly newsletter or email or an

668
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,039
in-person town hall type deal where they

669
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,760
can do recognition and stuff so those so

670
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
put that in there as a key

671
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
thing to remember if you're rolling out

672
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
these programs is yes you have to have

673
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
slack in teams and day-to-day uh

674
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
channels to provide prescriptive

675
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
guidance and scalability but you also

676
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
have to have that the human part which

677
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
is the communication

678
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,080
um okay so i'm gonna leave enough time

679
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
i'm gonna capture two or three more

680
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,640
things and then jump in the questions

681
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
and answers are you achieving your

682
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
desired outcomes this was the area that

683
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,760
um

684
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
i suspect it would turn out this way

685
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,799
but it was still disappointed so 42

686
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,039
percent said they were but like those

687
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,320
were soft uh it was soft responses

688
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,559
and uh for several of the product

689
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,720
security companies and

690
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
fintech companies they said yeah we feel

691
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
that we have but we've never got that

692
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
acknowledgement from our buyers for our

693
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
clients which would be more

694
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,280
be stronger

695
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,559
some of the

696
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,960
um anecdotes that came out of this

697
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,400
section or including the report were

698
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
pretty slick

699
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
for example a fintech

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
sizzo who said wait a second

701
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,159
i was asked on a due diligence call by

702
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,679
one of the big four banks about our

703
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,880
absence

704
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
program and then the app stick champion

705
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,799
specifically he just totally like hey he

706
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,159
has to have a hamster championship and

707
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,919
he went into a little

708
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,320
discussion uh sure enough they won the

709
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,799
big huge contract for that big bank

710
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
and uh the sales vp was like i don't

711
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
know what that absence champions program

712
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,279
is but keep doing that you know so that

713
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,520
that got a a pretty big

714
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,919
uh was a big deal for the sizzo enough

715
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
where he told me that in the in the

716
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,320
outbreak uh as a as a side story

717
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
so have you been able to quantify

718
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,640
you know any type of success uh

719
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
anecdotally and the numbers here point

720
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
to

721
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
uh areas for future improvement like um

722
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
i think it's safe to say

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,240
if it meant was it if it if it matters

724
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
it should be measured or something like

725
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,120
you

726
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,559
in a corporate environment where you're

727
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,240
competing for resources and attention

728
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,520
and time

729
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
this has got to be part of your program

730
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,919
even if not year one is the ability to

731
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,679
show successes through

732
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,919
you know lower bug count mean time to

733
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,120
fix

734
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,360
whatever you agree upon gamification um

735
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
you know

736
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,360
you've got to have something

737
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,279
okay so like i'm going to wrap up and

738
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,200
have plenty of time for questions

739
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
um there was some interesting things

740
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
that came out of this

741
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
people are still very evangelical as you

742
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
might imagine there's a strong belief in

743
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,480
these programs

744
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,080
but i still characterize them as

745
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,279
informal

746
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,760
immature and needing of additional

747
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,919
nurturing to be quite candid in

748
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,400
managerial oversight which is very uns

749
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
you know interesting but it's true

750
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,039
that the roi although was mostly

751
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,320
anecdotal and you know a case

752
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,880
for improvement and candidly was leaving

753
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,679
stuff on the uh on the table leaving an

754
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,200
opportunity there

755
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
as i mentioned a strong uh

756
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
observation was that we they had weak

757
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,000
managerial mandates across the the

758
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
the companies we uh surveyed

759
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
and that this interesting correlations

760
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,679
between the dev devs and app stick staff

761
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,360
and tooling and maturity

762
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
again sas das and sca i think we're

763
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,799
pretty slick

764
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
and like i said that it was a herculean

765
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,480
effort to grab that data and then make

766
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
something of it

767
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,559
uh

768
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,240
if those are if you're interested in

769
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
this please reach out afterwards because

770
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,600
i'd like to do this again i don't know

771
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,440
if i'd do it again

772
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,679
outside of an app a pandemic so it's

773
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,480
like a captive audience uh and it took

774
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
probably well hundreds of hours uh

775
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,640
and was pretty pretty much a heavy lift

776
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
uh there's some other relevance and and

777
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,279
i would just add to to close here

778
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,520
uh that if you're an apsec manager

779
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,559
leader

780
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
security architect sizzo

781
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
uh that you should re there's an andy

782
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
grove book on uh

783
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,240
just he's the former c ceo of intel

784
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,360
about

785
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
management and he talks about managerial

786
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
leverage which is the concept of

787
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
doing something once that has just a

788
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
widespread activity you know widespread

789
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
impact because you're able to get others

790
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,880
to do things for you understanding how

791
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
to apply that understanding that you're

792
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
in a weird way a marketing and sales

793
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,640
professional

794
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,559
promulgating these programs is there's a

795
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,400
lot of irony in there but it is i think

796
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
true the comparative data that came out

797
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,640
of this you can use

798
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
particularly as it relates to ratios and

799
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
to staffing

800
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
i think between what we've done and what

801
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,000
the other guys have done synopsis i

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
think it's pretty interesting

803
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,840
in order to gain leverage you should use

804
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,799
these incentives you should uh do

805
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,640
formalized training and you should

806
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,039
measure your roi i mean there's i don't

807
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,960
um i think you're leaving things on the

808
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
table if you don't

809
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
and uh

810
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
like ultimately we're successful not

811
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
when we're

812
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,480
a gatekeepers or builders or whatever

813
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
it's when we get

814
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,640
our software development brethren and

815
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
colleagues to view

816
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,320
you know the security of code as another

817
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
facet of quality

818
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,600
you know resiliency if you want to call

819
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,080
it that and with that uh so this is a

820
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
big deal there's a lot out there i hope

821
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,399
you've learned something uh i've already

822
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,880
got requests to continue to do this type

823
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
of thing or maybe even work on a

824
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,880
community interest around this topic so

825
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
uh with that i'm going to hand it over

826
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
to jackie i think we have plenty of time

827
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,760
here for questions
