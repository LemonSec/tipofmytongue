[Music]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,000
okay so hi just like jackie told you i'm

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,360
tonya jenka

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,400
and

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
i want to talk to you about

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,519
building security champions

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,720
so

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
i say i worded that really specifically

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,279
for a reason

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,199
not just because it's an oauth

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
conference and i always have a builder's

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,599
track

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,880
but because

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,199
you don't just get security champions

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,720
from anywhere you really have to build

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,399
them up into becoming champions

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,600
because if someone's already on the

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,880
security team they're already an

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,239
advocate they're already interested

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,079
they're already in my if they're me

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,160
they're obsessed with security but if

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,320
you are trying to attract people to

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
become a champion for you i believe we

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
need to build them up into that spot so

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
that first of all they own that position

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
they're awesome at it they know what

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
they're doing but also so they feel

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
built up and powerful and empowered and

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
knowledgeable and ready to do the job

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
and we're going to talk about security

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,920
champions because we want to talk about

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
how to scale our security programs

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
and our teams but actually let me just

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
tell you the way that i'm gonna tell you

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
so

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
i like to tell you what i'm gonna tell

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
you then i tell you then i tell you what

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
i told you because i want you to leave

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
here and be knowledgeable on the topic

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
of security champions if you already are

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,000
knowledgeable about that then i want you

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
instead to have a ton of good ideas to

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
go back to your office with to do with

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,439
your champions

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,119
so i want to talk about

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,840
scaling our security team and scaling

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
our security program and by that i don't

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,640
mean hiring 25 more people

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
because that's really hard to do right

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
now not just financially but just

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
actually finding them and attracting

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
them and keeping them

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
i also want to talk about what the heck

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
i mean by a security champion and how we

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
can build them up into awesome

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
advocates for our program

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,880
so throughout this entire session we're

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,920
gonna follow a recipe that i made up

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
partially because i've just worked with

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
so many companies over security

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
champions in a consulting

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
fashion and then also like built my own

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
program so

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,959
and also i've just like every time i see

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
an article or talk about it i have to

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
watch it or read it because i always

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
want to know how to do this better

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
because i found this really powerful

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
okay so the first thing we do is recruit

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
people and we're going to explore each

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,599
one of these i'm just telling you the

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,040
recipe in advance so that you know

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
what's coming so we're going to recruit

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
people we're going to engage them and

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
get them interested we're going to teach

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
them all the stuff they need to know

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
we're going to make sure we recognize

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
and reward them so they first of all

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
feel good about what they're doing and

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,879
also want to keep doing it and then most

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,879
important we are not going to stop so

82
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,760
this is uh the the biggest problem i see

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
with security champions program is they

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
start out hot

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
fast energetic like a sprinter um but

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
then it turns out it's not a sprint it's

87
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,920
actually a marathon

88
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
and it's better to go slow and steady

89
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
and be consistent if you want to

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
i guess we're not finishing the race do

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,599
you know what i mean like you want to

92
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,599
keep going and keep going and keep going

93
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
and so we're going to talk about some

94
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
tricks for that

95
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,200
so

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
as you heard i am tanya i'm the ceo and

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,480
founder of we hack purple i'm known as

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
shex purple on the internet and i

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,680
actually do have a little bit of purple

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
in my hair but i cut a lot off

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,720
and so i have to fix that obviously um i

102
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,879
wrote a book and i've been in tech a

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,080
long time and i try to i like i

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
volunteer a lot um and basically i am a

105
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
nerd on the internet that's the main

106
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,360
focus of this slide tanya is a nerd and

107
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
she's on the internet and

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,519
and speakers do this slide because we

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,840
want you to know about us and know

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
and hopefully feel confident you know

111
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
this person seems to know what they're

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
doing it is worth sitting through this

113
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,680
talk i hope that you're at home where i

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,480
am right now it is raining and dark and

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,519
it's

116
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
just kind of chilly so

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
i have some slippers on i'm nice and

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
warm i'm totally going to have some hot

119
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
chocolate after this i hope you are like

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,000
nice and cozy and comfortable wherever

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,799
you are and you're ready to sit in on

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,918
this with me and also put questions in

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,680
the chat

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
okay

125
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,240
so

126
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
the problem so i'm one of those people

127
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
where i don't like talks where they just

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
describe lots of problems and they don't

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,000
have solutions so i'm always like here's

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
the problem i'm going to give you five

131
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
percent of my talk time

132
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,759
and then 95 is how do we solve this

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,040
problem

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
so if you are at an ooz conference or if

135
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
you just work in i.t

136
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
you're probably well aware there's not

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
enough security professionals to do all

138
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
the jobs and i always focus on

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
application security because i was a dev

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
uh until around seven or i'm losing

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
track of how many years ago

142
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
when i switched over full time into

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
security i was interested in it i was

144
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
learning more about it i joined the oaus

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
meetup i was doing the things reading

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
the books podcasts all the stuff and

147
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,759
then one day i took the jump and by that

148
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
i mean i i begged and begged and begged

149
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,199
the security team until they agreed that

150
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
i could join

151
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
um i make it sound like it's like this

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
decisive decision is more like i was

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
trying a really long time and then it

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,919
worked but there's not enough security

155
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,759
professionals to do all of the jobs

156
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,280
there's just not

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,639
and

158
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,039
like it's a problem and because we know

159
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,199
there's not enough to go around we try

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,000
to scale our team and there's a lot of

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
different ways you could scale like

162
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
through automation and i always like i

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
mean i am a computer nerd so i i

164
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
literally want to automate everything i

165
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
have a giant garden and i've automated

166
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
the watering and i've automated some

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
lights if it's a rainy day and all this

168
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
stuff because that's what i'm like so

169
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
automating you know doing coaching

170
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
um

171
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,319
having interns like there's a lot of

172
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
different ways that you can try

173
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,479
to make your program scale but one of

174
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
the ways that i've seen work and one of

175
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,720
the ways that

176
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
i find can change a security culture

177
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,479
overall

178
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
so it's not just that it scales my team

179
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
but it scales my program

180
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
and that's why i scale and so the one

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
we're going to talk about today is

182
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
security champion specifically so here

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,080
is a super

184
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,919
formal definition that you can find on

185
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,880
wikipedia except for i made it nicer so

186
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,560
a security champion

187
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
is a member of a team

188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,160
that takes on the responsibility of

189
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,639
acting as the primary advocate

190
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
for security within their own team and

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
acting as a first line of defense for

192
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
security issues within the team

193
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,120
but let's say that again in plain

194
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,479
english

195
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,560
they're the person who's super excited

196
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
they are pumped up they read the book

197
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
they fix the bug they

198
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,919
watch the video they show up to the

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
stream they go to all your lunch and

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,680
learns they ask all the questions

201
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
they're emailing you they swing by your

202
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
desk they talk to you on whatever chat

203
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,280
program

204
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,039
that person

205
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
that is the person that you want to be

206
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
your security champion if you're

207
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
ignoring those people

208
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,319
that person is your new best friend

209
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,039
so what is a security champion like what

210
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
does tonya mean by this like it's nice

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
you have some words put them on the

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
screen explain it to me so that i can

213
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
actually

214
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
picture it in my mind

215
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,080
so security champion is your

216
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
communicator

217
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
they deliver messages from the security

218
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
team to the dev team and this can apply

219
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,199
like you can have people on the finance

220
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,720
team that are security champions you

221
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
just teach them different things

222
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,840
and

223
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
just realize i'm feeling like a little

224
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
short it's kind of like up my chair a

225
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,759
bit there we go now i'm taller

226
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,840
um

227
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,479
they deliver messages they share they

228
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,360
teach

229
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
and they help so

230
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
they might be the person that's in

231
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
charge of your sas tool and use it all

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,879
the time and they fix all the bugs

233
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,919
around it

234
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,879
or

235
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
they triage the results and then you

236
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
know give out the bugs the team

237
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
they are the person on the team that is

238
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
basically the contact for security

239
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,280
oh

240
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
does that bring me to the next bullet

241
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
point yes it does so they're your

242
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,879
contacts so they deliver messages

243
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
to the security team they keep you up to

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
date on what's important they tell you

245
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,400
when there's problems they ask for help

246
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
which is super important because if they

247
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,160
aren't asking you for help do you know

248
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
who they're asking they're asking stack

249
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
overflow and stack overflows telling

250
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,159
them the worst possible answer i assure

251
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,039
you

252
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,599
um they are your advocate

253
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
so they perform security work

254
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
for their team but with your help

255
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
but more importantly they advocate on

256
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
behalf of security so i'm going to get a

257
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
bit more into what advocacy means or

258
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,440
being an advocate but basically

259
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
imagine i am the security person and i

260
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,519
come to your team and i go to talk to

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,120
you and i'm like blah blah blah i want

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
you to fix this and that and i found

263
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,519
lots of bugs and i need you to fix it

264
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,000
all yesterday and you're like gosh she's

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that's not helpful i'm not enjoying this

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
discussion but imagine it's a person on

267
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
your team who's in the cubicle next to

268
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
you who you trust and you've worked with

269
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
for a few years and they say hey so i

270
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
ran this thing and it

271
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
lit up like a christmas tree i'm kind of

272
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
concerned can we

273
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
take a look together and try to split

274
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
these up and

275
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
maybe we can make it less embarrassing

276
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
by the time the security team sees it

277
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
when a peer asks you to do something or

278
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
bring something to your attention or

279
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
reminds you it's very different than

280
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
when someone from another team

281
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,680
does that especially

282
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,800
i don't know if you know but the

283
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,080
security team doesn't always have a

284
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
great rep

285
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
everywhere i definitely when i was a dev

286
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,000
i remember thinking how inappropriate

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
would it be if i crawled under my desk

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
so they didn't see me

289
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
if i get caught how embarrassing is it

290
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,600
versus potentially missing them

291
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
and so

292
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,480
having them advocate for you is huge

293
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
so i want us to build security champions

294
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
i want us to build them up and so let's

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
start the recipe

296
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
okay so first we're gonna recruit

297
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,839
so

298
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,680
yeah i like i like the idea of like the

299
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
big muscle like yeah let's recruit our

300
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
champions but basically

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
we are going to try to draw them in and

302
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
attract them

303
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
so

304
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
first rule

305
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,519
most important role number one

306
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
don't volunteer or order or force

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
someone to become a champion

308
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,959
attract people instead

309
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,720
and i know you're thinking like oh

310
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
that's easier said than done yeah i know

311
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
it's more work it is more work to do a

312
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
good job

313
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
it's really easy to do a bad job of

314
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
things trust me i know you should see

315
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
some home renovations i've done

316
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
but if you want to do a good job

317
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
and you want to get good results you

318
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,440
want to attract people who are actually

319
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
interested actually passionate

320
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
who have time who want to learn and when

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
you force someone like oh bob was late

322
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,480
to the meeting ha ha he has to be the

323
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
security champion that's not going to be

324
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
your best champion let me tell you

325
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,079
the second

326
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,640
most important rule for recruiting is

327
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,279
ensuring that their manager is on board

328
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,360
because if they won't give them time to

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,959
do this work

330
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
and they find it annoying that they're

331
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
doing it or they're trying to discourage

332
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
them again

333
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,560
you're not going to get the best work

334
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
you can and on top of that your

335
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,440
champion's going to feel really

336
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,760
conflicted if you're like hey do you

337
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
have time this week that we could um you

338
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
know get together and go over like what

339
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
your team's working on but meanwhile

340
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
their manager is like i need you to stop

341
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
wasting so much time

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,560
like you know with the security team

343
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
it's

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
it's incongruent and so if you are

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
seeing this where you have managers that

346
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
aren't on board you need to persuade the

347
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
manager and then go to the employee

348
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
because otherwise they're in sort of an

349
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
unfair position it's not going to go

350
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
well

351
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
so how do we recruit some champions

352
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
so

353
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
recruiting is the first stage but when

354
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,600
we get to

355
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
engagement and we get to training this

356
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,839
sounds weird but you will continue to

357
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
recruit throughout those two stages

358
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,120
because the things you're doing are

359
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
interesting and people are going to talk

360
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
people are going to notice

361
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
and you doing those things will continue

362
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,079
to recruit but you need to get a couple

363
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,000
of people to start with and then your

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
program will grow as people hear about

365
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,279
it so the first thing i do is i ask for

366
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
volunteers i know it sounds really

367
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,279
obvious but let's say i'm having a lunch

368
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
and learn or there's an all staff

369
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,839
meeting i'll ask can i have five minutes

370
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,440
or less and i'll get up i'm like hi i'm

371
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,480
tanya i'm from the aptek team and i want

372
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,040
you to know we are starting

373
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
like we're starting a security champions

374
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,920
program so those are people and explain

375
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,519
briefly what it is and say if you are

376
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,839
interested at all no obligation just you

377
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,240
know message me on teams or slack or

378
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
whatever it is that you use

379
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,440
and

380
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,760
like let's talk and some people will

381
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
message you

382
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,079
provide opportunities for them to reveal

383
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,639
themselves so i'm going to just skip

384
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,800
down so like having a lunch and learn or

385
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
some sort of training or some sort of

386
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,839
workshop

387
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,360
whatever it is

388
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
people that show up some of them might

389
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,880
want to be champions

390
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,839
ask

391
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
whoever asks questions so if there's a

392
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
dev that's always emailing you and

393
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
asking you stuff

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
invite them to become a champion don't

395
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,839
pressure them to say i'm looking for

396
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,760
champions and you know you and i talk a

397
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
lot and i thought you might be perfect

398
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,279
for this

399
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
and i wanted to see if you might be

400
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
interested

401
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
it's a little bit like asking someone on

402
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,639
a date but there's way less pressure and

403
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,800
there's way less chance of you getting

404
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,399
slapped

405
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,279
so

406
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,279
if you can use really interesting titles

407
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,279
for things that helps you

408
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,000
get um good things too so i'm really bad

409
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
at creating talks like talk titles so i

410
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
remember i had one it was called modern

411
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
approaches to application security and

412
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
everyone's like that talk title sucks

413
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,480
and it got rejected a bunch of times and

414
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
then my friend's like make it cool so i

415
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
was like purple is the new black which

416
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
means nothing

417
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
and then i was like modern approaches to

418
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
application security underneath the

419
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
subtitle and it got accepted i'm like

420
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
yes it's just you need a cool title to

421
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
get people to show up and it's so true

422
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,040
and so i am learning this lesson um

423
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
another thing that i have on this slide

424
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,680
is

425
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,519
adding to your email signature i'm

426
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
looking for security champions is this

427
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,240
you ask me how so my friend lucas did

428
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
this and he found four people emailed

429
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,440
him and they're like what are you

430
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,199
talking about and then two of them

431
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
became champions

432
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
yeah

433
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
another thing that really helps you get

434
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
the recruitment going

435
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
is setting up a mantra for your team so

436
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,279
when i first switched to security

437
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,800
you know i was coming from the dev

438
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,279
background and i remember

439
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
immediately we started saying no to lots

440
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
of things and i was like okay i guess

441
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,639
that's what we do but one day i realized

442
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
i didn't have to do that and i could say

443
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
okay so doing it that way presents a lot

444
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
of risk what if we think of other ways

445
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
that we could accomplish the same thing

446
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
but have less risk

447
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,839
um

448
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,160
if i can do that are you cool with

449
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,760
considering other options and they're

450
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
usually like yeah

451
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,440
then we would brainstorm and then we

452
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
would almost always be able to come up

453
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
with a better way together or sometimes

454
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
i would say i need to do some research

455
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,399
can we meet you know in two days from

456
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
now and they'd be like okay

457
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,040
and when i started saying

458
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,839
stop saying no and instead i literally

459
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,079
had a meeting today and i said it's my

460
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,320
job to help you do your job securely so

461
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,199
it's my job to help you and your team

462
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,519
it really defuses things because that's

463
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
actually what my job is and when you

464
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
have that mantra of i am here to serve

465
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,880
you

466
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
it really changes the conversation from

467
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
the beginning and the your actions will

468
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
change when you have that mantra i have

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,399
this friend named ray and he writes this

470
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,600
blog called hella secure and he has an

471
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,399
article about this and he says his devs

472
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,240
are his customers

473
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
and when you treat them like that

474
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,440
um it it really changes and it sounds

475
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
weird but all of a sudden there's people

476
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,959
that are interested in becoming security

477
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
champions

478
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,519
okay

479
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,320
so like i said recruitment continues

480
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,880
past the recruitment phase so as we do

481
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,959
engagement and as we do the teaching and

482
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,440
recognition and rewarding all of these

483
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
things you'll end up getting more

484
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
volunteers so if you're like i only have

485
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,040
four champions but i need 10 try not to

486
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,920
freak out and start doing engagement

487
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,279
so

488
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,320
engagement to engage someone is to

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
occupy attract or involve them

490
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,040
and i want to do that in security stuff

491
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
and the other way that we could talk

492
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
about engaging is participating or

493
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
becoming involved with i want to become

494
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
involved with them i want to know what

495
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,319
they're working on i want to know how i

496
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,439
can help

497
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,520
because if i say is there anything that

498
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,119
i can help you with and they say no the

499
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
first four times but the fifth time

500
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,240
they're like actually

501
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,919
there's this thing

502
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,520
yes

503
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,439
and you can build trust and show them

504
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,199
you know stuff

505
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
and help them make more secure choices

506
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,280
okay

507
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,679
so what can we do to engage software

508
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
developers

509
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
i got hugely engaged and ridiculously

510
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
passionate when i was invited on a

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
security incident i was supposed to just

512
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
be an observer and i was just like this

513
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,919
is neat like

514
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,799
they're always rushing around and

515
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
keeping secrets and stuff and i gets and

516
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,320
then there was code and i was like oh

517
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
i'm reading the code and i'm like oh no

518
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
this is happening like you can just read

519
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
that and it was actually off skated code

520
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
but i'm such a big nerd i was like oh

521
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
this means this and i was like yeah i

522
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,919
can and then i wrote a powershell script

523
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,480
to like de-off-skate the whole thing and

524
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
they were really impressed and then i

525
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
got to join the investigation which was

526
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
so cool

527
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,120
if

528
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
you have a dev and it is their app

529
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
involve them in the incident

530
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
share appropriate secrets if you can

531
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
make sure you

532
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,679
deputize them or explain what need to

533
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,440
know is because you don't want them

534
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
running around telling everyone about

535
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
this exciting thing they learned it's

536
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,919
very important they don't run around

537
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,000
tell all the secrets so you have to

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
decide for your organization what's okay

539
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
to share and what's not so for instance

540
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,440
i worked in a very in an

541
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
above top secret environment doing ant

542
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
uh anti-terrorism activities

543
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,520
and i remember

544
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,760
someone tried to let someone in without

545
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,559
checking their id and i

546
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
yeah he was like my super senior

547
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
whatever and i

548
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,360
i tore him a good new one and then i

549
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
remember these three ladies came up and

550
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
they're like oh hey could you hold the

551
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
door i'm like no this is a secure

552
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
facility you will sign in like everyone

553
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,360
else and they're like oh well we're in

554
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
her when we forgot our past and i was

555
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
like do you think i care

556
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
and i was like this is a top secret

557
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,080
facility there's no way i'm letting you

558
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,919
in so all of you back up away from the

559
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,840
door before i open it and i'm like also

560
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
i'm calling security to come talk to you

561
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,679
so don't go anywhere and it turned out

562
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
that they were the super secret people

563
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
and they're coming to check on us and i

564
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
had inadvertently passed a really

565
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
important test and i was like sorry i

566
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,480
was so messy and they're like no that

567
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
was perfect

568
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,200
i was pretty embarrassed but sharing a

569
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
secret like that

570
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,760
is

571
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
a way to get people interested i mean

572
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
you could share better secrets but i

573
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,080
certainly can't in a live talk

574
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,640
um let your champion see everything

575
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
first if there's going to be a policy or

576
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
you got a cool new tool or you're

577
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
considering a tool get them involved in

578
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
that selection process show them be like

579
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
do you like this one do you like that

580
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
one what do you like the best about it

581
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
because they're going to be using it

582
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,559
right

583
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,440
anything that you can let them see first

584
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
helps engage them

585
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
create a mailing list so i'm big on

586
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,799
mailing lists um i have an email mailing

587
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,200
list like just for my nerdy stuff but i

588
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
mean at work like i'll have a lunch and

589
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
learn list and i'll email them once a

590
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
month and i'm going to tell them like

591
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,480
listen we have this new cheat sheet that

592
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
we made and we also have a lunch and

593
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,799
learn coming up and here's the invite

594
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,320
and then also i want to tell you that

595
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,080
next month we're going to do this and if

596
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
anyone wants to volunteer let me know

597
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
and it might sound silly and like

598
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
they're not like super pretty or

599
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
anything i'm not good at that stuff it's

600
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
just a bunch it's a wall of text

601
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
but people read it and some of them

602
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
volunteer and some of them ask questions

603
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
and i get

604
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,280
engagement more

605
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,080
i

606
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
like to meet with them once a month this

607
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
was my friend ray again that pointed

608
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,640
this out i didn't realize that i just

609
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,120
naturally do that that

610
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
i would need to see them once a month

611
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,400
like i'd always find some excuse to talk

612
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
to them but he actually just sets like a

613
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,799
one month repeating meeting

614
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,840
and

615
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
just have a list of questions that you

616
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
always ask so they know they're coming

617
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
like what are you working on what are

618
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,720
you going to work on like what can i

619
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
help you with you know do you want me to

620
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
help you prioritize some of the bugs i

621
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
see your team having like are you

622
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
finding false positives with my tools

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
have a list of things that you ask ready

624
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
and you can put an agenda so they know

625
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
they're coming

626
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,039
this is a lesson i had to learn um the

627
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,520
hard way you need to brace yourselves so

628
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
once you build trust with all these

629
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
awesome intelligent humans where you

630
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
work

631
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
someone's gonna tell you something so

632
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,799
someone's gonna say like hey tanya um

633
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
so there's this thing and it's

634
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
it's probably nothing

635
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,720
it's gonna be something bad and then you

636
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
find out you know there's this team

637
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
rolling their own crypto i've definitely

638
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
had this happen twice there's a team

639
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
where they're like sure we're putting

640
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,520
their syn number in a url but we're base

641
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,159
64 encoding that field first and like no

642
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,200
one would think to decode that

643
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
um and so you need to play it cool

644
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
because the first time someone

645
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,640
i built all this trust and then they

646
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,159
told me something or something really

647
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,400
bad and i freaked out and then they

648
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
didn't want to tell me anything again

649
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,159
for a long time so i've learned to be

650
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,039
like

651
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,559
oh yeah

652
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,520
sure

653
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
and just like pretend that i'm chill

654
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
because i don't have a poker face my

655
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
poker face is like

656
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
um yeah so brace yourself

657
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,840
for them potentially telling you stuff

658
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
and try not to freak out on them

659
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
i try to let them meet each other

660
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
because it's awesome if they know each

661
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,960
other then they can help each other

662
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,159
that's good

663
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,320
um i invite them to join security

664
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,039
communities so where i used to work

665
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,159
we would walk together to the oas meetup

666
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,840
not always but some of them would come

667
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,400
some months and when we had the ctf

668
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
a bunch of them formed a team it was

669
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,840
really awesome

670
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
and no they did not win first place but

671
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
they weren't last place and i thought

672
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
that was great because it was their

673
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
first ctf they'd ever been to

674
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
and so

675
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
inviting them to like a local b-sides

676
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
conference because it's free or if you

677
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,600
actually work at a place that has money

678
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
you could invite them to a conference

679
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
that costs money

680
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,559
um just getting them involved in

681
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,559
community things can really pique a lot

682
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,240
of extra interest and again make them

683
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,039
feel engaged

684
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,000
so

685
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
what do we teach our champs

686
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,360
right

687
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
um so there's one key thing i want you

688
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
to take away from the teaching thing and

689
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
then i'm going to tell you lots of stuff

690
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,520
because i run a training school

691
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,440
so i'm really big in this topic and i

692
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
try i was like gosh i have like way more

693
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
in this one section than the rest of the

694
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,559
sections but i guess i feel really

695
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,000
strongly about it

696
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
but

697
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,280
only teach them what they need to know

698
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,120
oh my gosh

699
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
i have reviewed so much training from

700
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
other people where i'm like why are you

701
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,679
just like why is there all this filler

702
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
like why are you teaching them this

703
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
random thing that they could search on

704
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
the internet or

705
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
like why are you showing them showdown

706
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,159
like showdown's cool it has nothing to

707
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
do with the secure coding course right i

708
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,799
feel like or like there i remember this

709
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,080
one

710
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,720
trainer it was like half a day on what

711
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
is symmetric versus asymmetric

712
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
encryption and the history of

713
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
diffie-hellman

714
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,559
and

715
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,159
they were not writing encryption

716
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,600
software so i'm like why do they need to

717
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
know this like please please please

718
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,919
please stop stop stop stop like if it's

719
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,320
one extra slide that's one thing but i

720
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
see like a half day out of a two day

721
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,120
training where i'm like this is all

722
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,240
filler just like trash all of this

723
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
another thing that i see people miss is

724
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,240
you need to teach them what you need

725
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
expect and want from them as champions

726
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
like if you had a job and there was no

727
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
job description

728
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,720
and there was no like clear stuff that

729
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
your boss expected from you

730
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,360
would you take that job no

731
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,799
like you're a security champion what

732
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,480
does that mean well it means that you

733
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,880
advocate what does that mean

734
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
like you need to say like i need you to

735
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,039
triage all the security bugs i need you

736
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,600
to validate these results and i need you

737
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
to do a code review on every new pull

738
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
request for secure code review so i'm

739
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
going to give you secure code training

740
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
and then i want you to review every new

741
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
pull request on behalf of your team and

742
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
just look for those things on the list i

743
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
gave you and push it back if it doesn't

744
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,279
meet it and that's that's what i am once

745
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,799
a month i want to have this meeting with

746
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,200
you and if you tell them exactly what

747
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
you want from them you are more likely

748
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,080
to get a yes

749
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,159
but let's talk about some topics and so

750
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,039
i'm gonna

751
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960
give you like three headline topics and

752
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,559
we're gonna dive into each one of those

753
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,640
topics a bit more

754
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
so secure coding and architecture or

755
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,919
secure design

756
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,880
your policies and tooling but let's get

757
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,279
a bit more so secure coding and

758
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,080
architecture or design whatever you that

759
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,320
person does because if they are making

760
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,720
apps versus designing architecture of

761
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
bigger things

762
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,200
so formal training is good but you can

763
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
give them training too i know i run a

764
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,559
training company and you're like look at

765
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,080
her she's doing public speaking right

766
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,799
now but i want to tell you that i

767
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,520
was so bad at it when i started it it's

768
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,480
really

769
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,000
my first talk is not good i'd say i got

770
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
really good by my 50th one

771
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,919
and so

772
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
you can learn too trust me um so i am a

773
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
big fan of threat modeling

774
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
so

775
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,279
if someone's going to be designing

776
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,279
things i want them to know at least the

777
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
basics of threat modeling

778
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
security architecture so like

779
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,799
whiteboarding out what's gonna happen

780
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,200
and it's like is this a problem is this

781
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,240
a good idea etc code review if they are

782
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
a person that proves code want them to

783
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
review it

784
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,880
how to fix popular bugs or where to find

785
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
the answer

786
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
you don't have to teach them how to fix

787
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
every bug you need to teach them how to

788
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,159
find the answer to fixing the bug

789
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,000
i think that we need to repeat technical

790
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
training once a year why because people

791
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,799
leave and new people join and things

792
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,000
change and people forget

793
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
your policies i know you're like that's

794
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,760
boring i agree reading policies on the

795
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,720
internet you know like white background

796
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
black text

797
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,600
that is not my idea of a great time

798
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
so i am a big fan of teaching the

799
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,159
policies instead so here for people who

800
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,919
want to read the thing and for people

801
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,120
who don't want to i'm going to have a

802
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
meeting and i'm going to lively tell you

803
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,440
why we are doing this thing and why we

804
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,640
need your help

805
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
so

806
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080
only talk to them about the policies or

807
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,760
standards or guidelines that actually

808
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
apply to them and doing their job don't

809
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,360
teach them a ton of crap that they don't

810
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
need to know

811
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
help them create guidelines that are

812
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,080
missing so uh one of my clients they're

813
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,600
like yeah a bunch of our devs are going

814
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,440
to do serverless so we came up with a

815
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,679
serverless best practices guide of what

816
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,360
we were hoping to see from them and gave

817
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,279
that to them they're like oh cool thanks

818
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,200
whenever there's documentation missing

819
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,880
try to help them create it even if it's

820
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,559
just a one-pager with some best

821
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,200
practices or known things that often go

822
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,559
wrong say just wanted to give you a

823
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,320
heads up about this like just you doing

824
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
that effort

825
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
shows that you're there and shows that

826
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
you want to be involved

827
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,039
and also i mean

828
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,600
that document might save your butt right

829
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,159
if they follow those best practices you

830
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,919
might be avoiding so many things you

831
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,159
don't even think about like in brian's

832
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,880
talk earlier when he was talking about

833
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
you know

834
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,960
design flaws and how that's a vague

835
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,919
topic it's like it is but it it makes up

836
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,760
a huge percentage of what's wrong with

837
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
applications and why they're insecure

838
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,320
and it's a really valid conversation i

839
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,799
always want to have

840
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,799
teach them how to be compliant with your

841
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,080
policies and help them get there

842
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
whenever i create a new secure coding

843
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,720
guideline i've ended up finding out that

844
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
there'll be some devs that are worried

845
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
they're going to get fired or worried

846
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,000
because they support a bunch of legacy

847
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
apps like how am i ever going to have

848
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
the time to fix those it's like i'm

849
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,120
going to help you we're going to come up

850
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
with a plan and this might mean we hire

851
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
a consultant to fix those bugs it might

852
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
mean you know i loan you a champion from

853
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,039
another team and there's some sort of

854
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,960
job shadow thing happen

855
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,080
um

856
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,919
there's a lot of options for things but

857
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,440
i want everyone to know like no one's

858
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
getting fired this policy is not stick

859
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,679
i'm going to run around and use so i can

860
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,000
fire people i don't like it's it's a

861
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,320
level that i want us to all move towards

862
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
being at so that i can sleep at night

863
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,240
and not all my hair is grey from working

864
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,480
here

865
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,120
i believe that every software developer

866
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
and technical person should be briefed

867
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
on what their role is during a security

868
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,159
incident

869
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,880
i have had software developers help desk

870
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,720
operations folks try their best to help

871
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,360
and ruin the chain of custody i've had

872
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,240
them

873
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,600
nickel

874
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,279
i went to the dentist one day so i

875
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,039
showed up late and all the executives

876
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,399
were basically just running around

877
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,799
screaming the sky is falling and it was

878
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,559
because a help desk person

879
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,320
who had never been briefed on what to do

880
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,919
during an incident and tried to manage

881
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,840
an incident themselves

882
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,080
and had told all the executives that one

883
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,600
of our buildings was infected with

884
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
malware even though the building was a

885
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,039
dumb building and it was made of

886
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,559
concrete and concrete doesn't get

887
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,600
malware

888
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,960
and it turned out there's just a lot of

889
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,520
canadians watching the olympics and it

890
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,360
was figure skating and we really dig

891
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,840
that here and it was just like lots of

892
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
people watching the olympics from their

893
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,840
desk that's all it was and if that help

894
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,000
desk person had known when they should

895
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,520
pass it over and what their role is

896
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
during an incident i wouldn't have had a

897
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,360
whole bunch of executives talking in the

898
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,039
elevator telling everyone else how one

899
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,919
of our buildings had caught malware

900
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
it took me weeks to get everyone to stop

901
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,360
saying that and explain over and over

902
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,159
again

903
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,640
seriously concrete can't anyway cannot

904
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
get malware um i'm a big fan of job

905
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,200
shadowing so it's like i'm gonna do

906
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
you know code review all day on this

907
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,559
does anyone want to join me

908
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,240
um i know some people are like that

909
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,200
sounds really boring but um i dig it so

910
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,240
there um and i am a big fan of holding

911
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
consultations so if i'm gonna write a

912
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,559
new secure coding guideline

913
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,559
i want everyone's opinion

914
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,000
you know i've created cheat sheet this

915
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,240
is draft one tell me how you feel what

916
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,559
do you think i want to know and then i

917
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,559
adjust because guess what all those devs

918
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,799
are smart that's why they're not our ex

919
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,919
dev

920
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,200
that's why they still work for us

921
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,880
because they're smart

922
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,600
okay tooling

923
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
so if you have tools you expect them to

924
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,760
use you want to know they're doing it

925
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,960
safely so i like to give my own training

926
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,039
on the tools i want them to use

927
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,640
again you're like tanya makes training

928
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,480
professionally but i did not always i

929
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
assure you my first training was not the

930
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,399
best i was like we're all going to click

931
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,919
here we're going to click the default

932
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,360
don't touch anything else i don't know

933
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
what will happen

934
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,200
and i was like don't touch this button

935
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,519
it's very dangerous

936
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,399
but i'm better at it now and the message

937
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,039
got across because my first champions

938
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,440
program all i wanted them to do was scan

939
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,039
it with zap

940
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,120
scan with all the default settings and

941
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,600
just fix the highs and criticals that's

942
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,840
it all i need from you just please do

943
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
that because i am the only pen tester

944
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,679
for all zillion of you

945
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,200
and if you could just not send me things

946
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
that are blazingly on fire

947
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,200
that would be great

948
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,640
can zap do way more than that yes it can

949
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,559
but it was enough training that all the

950
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,080
devs could do it and stuff started

951
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,399
showing up on my desk and it was a lot

952
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,200
nicer to look at

953
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
i want the devs to know what the output

954
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
means from my tools i don't want to be a

955
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,600
mystery i don't want them to receive it

956
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
and ask if it's in english or not

957
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,320
if i am expecting them to handle the

958
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,240
output directly i need to teach them how

959
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
to validate those results because i

960
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,919
don't want them chasing false positives

961
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,480
so i want to give some lessons on that

962
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,559
if i am expecting them to install the

963
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,480
tools so sometimes you can install

964
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,200
things for them but quite often you know

965
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
they're creating pipelines they're off

966
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,240
they're being devs they're creating and

967
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
building and doing all the stuff all the

968
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,640
time

969
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,600
and so

970
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,919
i might say okay so like here's how to

971
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,360
install it and here's the settings i

972
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,200
want to see like go forth and conquer

973
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,559
now

974
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,240
i always want to be a part of helping

975
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
them select the best tools if they will

976
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,159
allow me to be part of that conversation

977
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,320
i definitely want to be

978
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
um and i like to do lunch and learns or

979
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,600
hackathons or workshops or whatever

980
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,640
it is

981
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,159
it doesn't need to be perfect it doesn't

982
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
need to be amazing it doesn't need to be

983
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,480
a wasp global absec worthy

984
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,440
it just needs to be worthy of their time

985
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
and you just show them the things you

986
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,080
really need them to do and so i briefly

987
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,159
want to talk about coaching which is a

988
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,760
style of teaching

989
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,519
if you are not good in front of an

990
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,720
audience which

991
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,159
i i was

992
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,240
i was really terrified when i started

993
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,399
doing public speaking i really was i was

994
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,080
terrified um and it took me a while so i

995
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,159
did coaching instead

996
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,960
a lot and it turns out like a mix works

997
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,559
really well for me

998
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,440
and so coaching is a so so the kitty has

999
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
a lifesaver because it's powerful so

1000
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,279
like i thought that they looked like a

1001
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,200
jedi but they needed a lifesaver to make

1002
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,360
that clear but anyway so let's talk

1003
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,399
about how

1004
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,080
about what coaching means and then how

1005
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,000
you could do some so you don't have to

1006
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
stand up in front of all of your peers

1007
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,880
and say stuff

1008
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,960
you could do this instead

1009
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,760
so

1010
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,519
coaching means

1011
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,519
formal definition again

1012
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,000
enabling individuals and teams to

1013
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,079
achieve their full potential

1014
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,359
it means basically helping them make

1015
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,599
real lasting change

1016
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,359
right and what

1017
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,079
we want these people to change is their

1018
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,918
opinion and viewpoint and knowledge on

1019
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,199
security

1020
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,440
i want security to be extremely

1021
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,679
important to my champions i want them to

1022
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,079
be interested in it i want them to take

1023
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,399
it seriously and

1024
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
that will emanate to the rest of the

1025
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,639
team that's really important to me so if

1026
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,399
we want them to start practicing a

1027
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,239
secure system development life cycle we

1028
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
need to support them in getting there

1029
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,399
and if we want them to sing our the

1030
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,879
praises of security we need to

1031
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,960
constantly reinforce those values with

1032
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,280
them and coaching is a way where you get

1033
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,879
many touch points

1034
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
versus you know standing up in front of

1035
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
a crowd with a lot of people

1036
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
and so what can we how can we do some

1037
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,320
coaching so for champions specifically

1038
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
set up office hours you know every

1039
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,480
thursday from two to four i have office

1040
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,960
hours and my zoom or my team's meeting

1041
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
or whatever is just open

1042
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
i'm always there

1043
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,800
it's an open invitation for anyone to

1044
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,760
come and talk to me about security

1045
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,440
set up repeat meetings with each one of

1046
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,280
your champions each month

1047
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
and um like i said that was my friend

1048
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,119
ray's idea but it didn't occur to me

1049
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,040
that i would go talk to them all at

1050
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,119
least once per month and when he when i

1051
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,560
read it in his article i was like oh my

1052
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
gosh that's so true and you could just

1053
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,839
set up a meeting to make sure it happens

1054
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,000
instead of having to think about going

1055
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,079
to talk to them

1056
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,960
help them prioritize because it can be

1057
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,480
overwhelming

1058
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
i

1059
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
one of my clients scanned something that

1060
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,760
they had acquired and it had 43 000

1061
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,520
vulnerabilities and i don't know about

1062
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,480
you but i found that overwhelming and so

1063
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,160
instead i'm like okay so actually

1064
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
there's two types of vulnerabilities

1065
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,200
that i want them to do and it's like a

1066
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,599
copy paste fix and so i want to talk to

1067
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,599
them about the two bugs i need them to

1068
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,440
fix there just happens to be 101

1069
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,280
instances in total

1070
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,920
and then it was less scary

1071
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
whenever you can be available for your

1072
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,079
champions they are important to you and

1073
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,760
you should be important to them and if

1074
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,359
you don't make time for them they will

1075
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,880
feel that

1076
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
and they'll stop asking you

1077
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
and then bad things happen

1078
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,119
um i like to help them set goals and

1079
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,880
then help them achieve those goals and

1080
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,800
sometimes helping them achieve it is

1081
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
just asking them once a week hey did you

1082
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,720
get that thing working yet do you need

1083
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,640
me to come help oh no you don't need me

1084
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,800
to okay and then a week later hey did

1085
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,640
you get that thing working oh do you

1086
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,839
need my help okay i'll be there

1087
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,960
later um

1088
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,119
teach them specific skills or tools i

1089
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,200
like to basically ask them what they

1090
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,119
need or what they want and then try to

1091
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,079
help them

1092
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
do it and so maybe they're like you know

1093
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
what one day i'm hoping eventually to be

1094
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,480
an offensive security engineer or one

1095
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,119
day you know i'm hoping to be a cso or

1096
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,880
whatever their thing is if there's ways

1097
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
that you can help enable them in doing

1098
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,560
that thing or maybe they want to be a

1099
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
software architect someday and so

1100
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
learning all the threat modeling and

1101
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
security architecture will help them be

1102
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,040
awesome at that and so enable them

1103
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,839
and

1104
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,839
basically you win and they win and your

1105
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,240
organization wins

1106
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
briefly i want to talk about delegation

1107
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
i didn't know where to put this slide in

1108
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
this really isn't in the teaching

1109
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,119
section but i was like it needs to be in

1110
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,040
this presentation so i'm just gonna give

1111
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,800
her

1112
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
some things

1113
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,079
you should not do

1114
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,079
even if you know how you're like i know

1115
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,680
how to fix i know how to fix that

1116
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,839
security bug yeah i know you know how

1117
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,520
but there's one of you and there's 500

1118
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,440
of them and you don't have time to fix

1119
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
every bug

1120
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,400
it doesn't mean you should never fix

1121
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,560
bugs i'm telling you that sometimes you

1122
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
gotta delegate if someone's going to

1123
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,079
update a framework is that really your

1124
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,040
job

1125
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,800
planning releases and upgrades i don't

1126
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,119
feel that's our business like assigning

1127
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,680
who does what running every single scan

1128
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
implementing right like

1129
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
there's lots of things that just aren't

1130
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,760
our job and there's going to be too much

1131
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,839
work for you and so this is the type of

1132
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,839
stuff that maybe you want to delegate

1133
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,599
your awesome champions and maybe at

1134
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,880
first you do it with them you have a

1135
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,000
session and together you review those

1136
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,079
responses and requests and go through

1137
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,280
and see the problem together but

1138
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,800
eventually you want them to do it on

1139
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
their own

1140
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,800
things not to delegate this is really

1141
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,160
important some things should not be

1142
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
delegated i

1143
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,599
i remember some of my friends they're

1144
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
like oh that person is the delegator

1145
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,119
like what does that mean they're like

1146
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,800
they delegate their entire job like i

1147
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
literally don't know what they do all

1148
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,320
day they literally delegate 100 of their

1149
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,000
work and i was like oh that person's

1150
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
smart

1151
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,440
but some things should not be delegated

1152
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,920
so if you have a sas tool static

1153
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
application security testing tool until

1154
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,560
you have given training to your devs how

1155
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,400
to validate that stuff you should be

1156
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,079
validating it

1157
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,839
you get you got to give them

1158
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,920
training and work with them

1159
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,599
i've seen so many companies that get a

1160
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,200
sas tool they're like yeah you deal with

1161
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
it and then the sas tool gets like

1162
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
unplugged and no one's using it and

1163
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,560
you're paying a lot of money for nothing

1164
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
those tools are powerful and amazing but

1165
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
if you don't give training to your devs

1166
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,800
you're gonna get bad results

1167
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,280
giving security securities approval on

1168
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
literally anything

1169
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
no approvals unless they're from you i'm

1170
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
using a new tool without training

1171
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,880
training other champions

1172
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
we are looking for partnership and

1173
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,040
assistance not replacement i have seen

1174
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,240
it where

1175
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,480
people go a bit too far and delegate 100

1176
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,560
like way too much and you don't want

1177
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,240
that because then they don't need you

1178
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,680
anymore but also

1179
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,839
bad things can happen

1180
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,720
okay so the next two are recognition and

1181
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,079
rewards

1182
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,079
and so i'm doing both because you should

1183
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
do both so i am the type of person that

1184
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,880
really enjoys recognition so if someone

1185
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
tells my boss i did a good job and then

1186
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,680
my boss is like pat pat i am overjoyed i

1187
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,320
am so that person

1188
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,079
someone like put a gold star on

1189
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,320
something i'd be like yes versus

1190
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
someone's like oh we're gonna give you a

1191
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,320
50 gift certificate to like some

1192
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,800
restaurant i'm like yeah i have money i

1193
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
can eat there if i want to

1194
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,040
for me that's not as big of a reward as

1195
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,599
my peers or my boss

1196
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,000
knowing and expressing like knowing i

1197
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,599
did a good job expressing gratitude

1198
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,760
toward that so i am in the recognized

1199
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
category but a lot of people are a lot

1200
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,280
of them are in the reward category so we

1201
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,800
have to talk about both and you need to

1202
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,319
do both so it is important to recognize

1203
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,160
your champions we want them to know

1204
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,560
they're doing a good job and we do not

1205
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,079
want them to feel like they are doing

1206
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,359
two jobs and they're getting one

1207
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,680
paycheck we want them to know we are

1208
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
grateful we appreciate them we don't

1209
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,200
want them to feel like this kitty where

1210
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,119
they're just squish squished and not

1211
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,440
appreciated

1212
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,000
so how can we recognize them

1213
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,920
it sounds so silly but like literally

1214
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
right above me i have two little

1215
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,560
certificates that people made for me and

1216
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,240
i was like well obviously man put them

1217
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,720
on the wall is all excited

1218
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,680
um

1219
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,760
recognize them in front of their peers

1220
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,839
so this could mean having a special

1221
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,440
virtual background for security

1222
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,040
champions or putting a star next to

1223
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,839
their name in slack or teams

1224
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,440
doing something visual that makes it

1225
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,000
clear that person is a champion

1226
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,680
always put a note in their performance

1227
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,560
review to thank them for doing this work

1228
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,800
on top of the regular job

1229
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
always do that

1230
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
tell their boss every single time they

1231
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,000
do something big

1232
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,480
like yeah a couple weeks ago brad told

1233
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,560
me that there was this

1234
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
t he'd been you know to this developer

1235
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,480
lunch and this team was talking about

1236
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,560
how they'd rolled their own crypto

1237
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,319
and he told me about it and i went and

1238
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,599
approached that team and asked them to

1239
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,359
do a secure review and then i stumbled

1240
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,520
upon the thing that brad told me about

1241
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,040
and then i was able to course correct

1242
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,960
and now they're doing proper encryption

1243
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,119
and without brad i wouldn't have known

1244
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,560
you know in the security architecture

1245
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
thing they had marked it as encryption

1246
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
and it would have taken a while for us

1247
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,440
to figure that out and it might have

1248
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,319
been when we had an incident and so i am

1249
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,160
so happy that brad told me about this

1250
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,079
and trusted me with this information to

1251
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,760
know i would handle it well and not make

1252
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,960
him look like

1253
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,319
a snitch

1254
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,760
in front of his team when really what

1255
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,839
he's doing is the right thing and trying

1256
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,560
to fix a security problem right

1257
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,440
um

1258
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,200
sending them an email and telling them

1259
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
that you noticed that they did something

1260
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,720
good so if it's a thing they already

1261
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,000
told you about in the meeting you don't

1262
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,319
need to email them after and be like

1263
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,960
i noticed that but let's say you know

1264
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
someone's like yeah brad was telling me

1265
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,520
you know there that i should talk to you

1266
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
about this

1267
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,520
yes thank you write them a message and

1268
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
say thank you for their help these

1269
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,599
little things make a huge difference

1270
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,000
um one more thing is if you can make it

1271
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,839
clear in front of their peers

1272
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,079
that their role matters and like what

1273
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,400
their role is again this makes people

1274
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,200
feel good like i like it

1275
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,319
okay so rewarding them so i'm a big fan

1276
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,160
of rewarding good behavior instead of

1277
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,040
attempting to punish bad behavior

1278
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,880
and

1279
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,960
i like to reward whatever i can i

1280
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,480
remember i had an employee and they had

1281
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,119
messed up very very very badly and i was

1282
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,280
very upset with them and i remember

1283
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
saying i don't need to punish you

1284
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,640
because i know you're going to punish

1285
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,000
yourself way more than i ever would so

1286
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,680
tomorrow when you've cooled down let's

1287
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,040
have a discussion about how this can

1288
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,640
never happen again

1289
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,040
an employee was just like i am gonna

1290
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,960
punish myself aren't i and i'm like i'm

1291
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,560
not telling you to i just know that's

1292
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,800
what you're gonna do so i'm not gonna

1293
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,079
tell you all my thoughts because you

1294
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,440
already know

1295
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,400
and

1296
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,160
let's try to talk about good behavior

1297
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,920
and what they could do better next time

1298
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,040
and so let's reward anything that we can

1299
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,359
reasonably so i'm a big fan of the

1300
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,119
double dip so i'm rewarding them by

1301
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,200
mostly reinforcing security stuff so

1302
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,599
let's get them security gifts

1303
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,960
training

1304
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
permission to go like leave work early

1305
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,920
to attend something books videos

1306
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,880
ctfs whatever it is a ub key i've seen a

1307
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,240
lot of places where if someone did

1308
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,160
something good they got a uv key for

1309
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,000
personal use it's like yes they're doing

1310
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,240
mfa at home too

1311
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,040
giving them your time and undivided

1312
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,839
attention when someone comes to your

1313
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,680
desk turning your body

1314
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,440
like this and facing them and looking at

1315
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
them put down your damn phone and look

1316
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,960
in their eyes and talk to them and

1317
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,839
listen

1318
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,440
this will make an impression trust me

1319
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,359
help them with more than just security i

1320
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,800
know a lot of security engineers were

1321
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,960
short on time but if this is a person

1322
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,240
that's a good champion and they're like

1323
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
yeah i'm just like really stuck on this

1324
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,920
thing or you know i applied for a

1325
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,240
promotion or i'm applying and like i had

1326
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
to write like this letter i'm like want

1327
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,280
me to proofread it i'm like good at this

1328
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,599
i've been doing tech forever like really

1329
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,880
yeah of course i will it's going to take

1330
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,760
10 minutes those little things make them

1331
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
feel good and valued

1332
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,319
let them help you make decisions let

1333
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,400
them see a new tool first anything that

1334
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
you can think of to let them know how

1335
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,640
valuable they are to you do those things

1336
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,920
okay last one the hardest one

1337
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,800
don't stop so when in doubt over

1338
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,240
communicate

1339
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
if you do not communicate regularly your

1340
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,960
program is going to disappear

1341
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,760
way faster than you think

1342
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,000
most often when i'm called in to consult

1343
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
it's like well in 2019 we were doing

1344
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
blah blah and then um

1345
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and then we stopped for a few months and

1346
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,560
then that was two years ago and

1347
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,359
so

1348
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,200
let's you know what are we gonna do with

1349
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,560
our program i'm like we don't really

1350
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,200
have a program so let's let's try to you

1351
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,680
know start again and let's not sprint

1352
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,119
let's marathon this let's plan out

1353
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,760
slow and steady

1354
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,520
so ways that we can do this consistency

1355
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,200
and consistency means planning in

1356
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,720
advance

1357
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,480
even if you only meet with them once a

1358
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,400
month so there's no education there's no

1359
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,640
lunch and learns there's no big deals or

1360
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
anything it's just you're just checking

1361
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,760
in and you're like hey

1362
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,280
i wanted to check in with you and see if

1363
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,680
you need any help with anything

1364
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,680
what have you been working on lately is

1365
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,359
there anything there for me

1366
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,880
do you need introductions to people on

1367
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,000
other teams let me know i'm here it

1368
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,920
sounds and sometimes they'll be like

1369
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,319
yeah everything's good can i just can i

1370
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,400
just talk to you next month sure

1371
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
right because they're busy and frantic

1372
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
or whatever because they actually have a

1373
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,160
full-time job that they're busy doing

1374
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,079
but just the fact that you checked in

1375
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,640
lets them know your program still exists

1376
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,160
some champions are going to need more of

1377
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,079
your time than others and some champions

1378
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,680
are going to be better than others some

1379
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,440
people will do the bare minimum because

1380
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,599
that's who they are and guess what that

1381
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,480
is way better than nothing

1382
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,240
if you accidentally drop your program

1383
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
pick it up as soon as you can even if

1384
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
it's just an email to tell them that

1385
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,119
next month you're going to have a lunch

1386
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,720
and learn and you actually have nothing

1387
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,200
planned you have a whole month to get

1388
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
ready

1389
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,480
um culture is a practice just like yoga

1390
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,800
you don't do yoga once and then two

1391
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,240
years later you're like why can't i

1392
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,720
touch my toes you have to practice

1393
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,359
over and over and over and over and that

1394
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,960
is the same with us

1395
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,440
it will fall apart faster than you think

1396
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,680
if you do not continue to touch base and

1397
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,839
continue to make sure they know you are

1398
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,920
there

1399
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,839
so this is the recipe we followed and we

1400
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,359
did it and we're awesome and the stick

1401
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,680
figure people are high-fiving yes i love

1402
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
this picture

1403
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,040
so let me conclude and then we're going

1404
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,839
to do some q a so conclude

1405
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:20,880
well and then i'm going to give you

1406
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,960
resources then we're going to do q a so

1407
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,119
what did we learn so we learned how to

1408
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,119
attract the right people

1409
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,559
and that's in the recruiting phase the

1410
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,280
engagement phase and the teaching phase

1411
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,440
we talked about what to teach them and

1412
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,119
what not to teach them and different

1413
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,599
ways you can teach

1414
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,599
how to engage them and make them

1415
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,520
interested and turn them into your

1416
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,960
advocate so they are on your side

1417
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,559
what to delegate and some things we

1418
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,400
should probably not delegate

1419
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,160
how to make them feel motivated so

1420
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,400
rewarding and recognizing them which are

1421
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,920
not the same thing and we have to do

1422
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,680
both because you cannot tell by looking

1423
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,319
which one is which

1424
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,839
and basically we talked about how to

1425
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,000
build a really amazing security champion

1426
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,119
program

1427
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,079
so again the recipe for the 4000th time

1428
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,760
but if you wanted to take a screenshot

1429
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,640
of a slide this might be a good one

1430
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,000
but

1431
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,240
let's see some free resources and then

1432
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,920
and then jackie's going to come back on

1433
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,240
so there are some resources so the first

1434
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,559
one is i have an online community that

1435
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,000
is free

1436
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,119
so there's

1437
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,079
live streaming events there's articles

1438
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,800
there's chat rooms and sometimes we just

1439
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,480
hang out and talk about cool books we

1440
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,440
like but

1441
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,720
community.wehackforbl.com totally free

1442
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,040
we don't sell stuff inside the community

1443
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
it's just a hangout space because i

1444
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
wanted to hang out there

1445
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
my business is like what we don't really

1446
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,640
make money off this i'm like i know but

1447
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,839
i get to hang out there and it makes me

1448
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,040
really happy so we're going to keep

1449
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,880
doing it

1450
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,800
um these books are not free but um i so

1451
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
obviously i think my book's amazing

1452
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,640
that's alice and bob learn application

1453
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,240
security but all of these books are

1454
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,400
awesome i believe devops is the way

1455
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,480
forward and making excellent

1456
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,160
rugged software that is secure and so

1457
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,000
there's the devops handbooks the phoenix

1458
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
project accelerate the unicorn project

1459
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,079
plus alice and bob learn

1460
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,760
these are all books that can really help

1461
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,800
you basically be more awesome

1462
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
i have a podcast we currently have a

1463
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,680
break

1464

um but season two is just gonna be tips

1465
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,599
and tricks about all these things you

1466
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,160
can do to just do security better as

1467
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
well as interviews with cool people that

1468
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,520
i meet

1469
