[Music]

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
thank you

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,880
so um again as uh as gene just said uh

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,719
my name is yuval i'm the head of product

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,799
management for everything cloud security

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,160
with uh with checkpoint and um

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,080
today i'd like to

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
talk a little bit about

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
what's different in terms of

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
uh cloud deployments and why do we need

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
machine learning and ai so much

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,719
in in these spaces of of cloud security

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,200
in order to really effectively shift

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
everything that we do to the left

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
now when we when we

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
say cloud it looks like

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,320
one thing right let's just push

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
everything to the cloud and get on with

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
it but we do need to understand that for

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
for different people in the organization

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
and different people within the security

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
organization

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
is is actually different layers right

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
with different security needs and it

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
actually means different things

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,680
the the thing that connects everything

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
is the fact that it all lead to operated

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,680
cloud speed and i'm probably going to

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,320
use the the term cloud speed multiple

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
times first we need to build an

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
infrastructure the infrastructure could

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
be um

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,759
networking security infrastructure and

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,600
on top of it we're going to put some you

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
know moving cog wheels like virtual

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
machines and containers and serverless

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
functions etc etc but we're actually

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
when we when we look at what is of

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
interest to

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
um

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
to the cio the cisos of the organization

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
they're usually very focused on the web

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
interfaces and those web interfaces

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
could be end user web interfaces or api

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,520
interfaces and the reason is because a

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
lot of organizations go through digital

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
transformation the the web interface is

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
becoming their storefront or their

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,320
revenue generating interface and from an

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
api

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,079
and service web service perspective a

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
lot of digital transformation that takes

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
place in the supply chain actually use

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
apis in order to really push everything

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
that that needs to be updated from a

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,360
supply chain partner and vice versa

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
one thing that is kind of across the

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,959
board is the fact that everything across

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,520
these uh these different layers is

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
deployed through a ci cd pipeline today

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
could be you know new

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,440
entities on the infrastructure it could

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,519
be new virtual machines new serverless

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
functions uh and of course new

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
applications so it doesn't really matter

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
if you want to deploy a new firewall you

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
want to deploy a new container or you

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
want to deploy a new app everything is

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519
going to be done through ci cd

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,879
now cloud actually is is a serious thing

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
when it comes to security and and based

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,720
on the verizon data breach

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
report that was released this year

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
we see that

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
cloud security breaches actually surpass

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
this year the on-prem security

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
beaches and we all know the the stories

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
we heard about capital one we heard

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,159
about swiss cloud and others

80
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
and you know i think that swiss club by

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,040
the way is an interesting one because

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,159
it's

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,159
in you know underway of trying to secure

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
against the os top 10 they deployed the

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
web application firewall but it was

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
misconfigured right and also they had

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
some misconfiguration on the identity

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
part

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,959
uh and that's exactly what allowed you

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
know allowed customers to sorry allow

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
the adversary to actually access

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
customer information so we all

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,159
understand that cloud is is here it's

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
here to stay it's not a matter of just

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,319
like you know a couple of years ago when

96
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,840
we said are you going to move to the

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
cloud

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
there's no question today every cio

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
every cio i talk with say we're already

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,879
in the cloud in in some way or form

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
um and as we go to the cloud we need to

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
understand that the attack surface and

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
the threat surface actually are now as

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
wider as they have ever been

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,799
so what really keeps the security people

106
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
awake at night first

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
is the fact that due to the

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
organizational shift left

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,040
they have very little visibility and i

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
think that most of the most of the

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,199
technological advancement in the last

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,080
years actually pushed visibility out of

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,919
the question when it came to when it

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,639
came to the security side of things

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
back in the days when i was a cia so

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
myself i remember that when an

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,520
application was started to get designed

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,080
i was involved on day one i was asked

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
like what do you think how should we do

120
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
it how should we build it today security

121
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,600
people are being called like one day

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
prior to launch

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
where the devops and the dev team say

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,639
where we built it

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
it's ready to go

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
secure it oh and by the way it has to be

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
ready by tomorrow

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
um the next thing which kind of is very

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,520
connected to it is am i still relevant

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,240
as a security person right if i'm not

131
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
allowed to

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,960
help

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
earlier in the process and i'm just

134
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
becoming almost like a bottleneck or a

135
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,919
chalk point for the for the business am

136
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,639
i really as relevant as i want myself to

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
be within the organization

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
next is something that didn't even

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
change ever since first day of

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
information security which is how do i

141
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
keep myself and my organization my

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
business off the wall street journal

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
headline and you know replace wall

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
street journal with your favorite

145
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
magazine where you like to read about

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,840
you know hackings and and big things

147
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,759
right last but not least

148
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
this world really is becoming very

149
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
complex for security people again

150
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
because of their distance from

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
where things are today happening but

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,720
also because there are so many new terms

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,520
and new um um

154
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
new conventions that are are for you

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
know for a lot of the development teams

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
a lot of the devops teams for them it's

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
like it's clear right but

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
frankly as a security person when i

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,919
first heard about service functions for

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,240
me it felt like like you know black

161
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
magic or or something like that or some

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
kind of of alcohol

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,199
now

164
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,360
if we now take these

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
things and we try to understand how do

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,199
we fix

167
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
uh on the cloud

168
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
the the you know the challenge that we

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,680
have we actually have again a lot of

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
technical complexities it's not just a

171
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,319
complexity from uh you know hey i just

172
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,840
have a lot of things

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
first

174
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,520
we still need to segregate and segment

175
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,680
cloud environments we need to do it at

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
cloud speed right so we we are deploying

177
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
network security threat prevention

178
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,720
systems in the cloud next is how do i

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
reduce the attack surface by making sure

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
that everybody that is pushing something

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,520
through the cicd pipeline is actually

182
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,919
pushing an image or a avm which are

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
compliant with whatever security best

184
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,199
practices i want to um i want to use it

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,520
could be like a well-known framework or

186
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
maybe it's just the best practice where

187
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
i actually decided what the best

188
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,919
practice is and i want to make sure that

189
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
i'm doing it across multiple cloud the

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
way that we call it is do it just

191
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
everywhere right

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
um next is build microservices build

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
microservices that that together

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
actually make up those applications and

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
again those applications of what matters

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
for the top management in most of the

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
organizations i speak with and this is

198
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
exactly where

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
we are on the inflection point between

200
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,639
compliance and posture which is more

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
around the visibility of things tell me

202
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,400
when something went wrong with a

203
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,479
possible automatic remediation if

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
something went wrong but the next thing

205
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
when we talk about workload is actual

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,400
runtime

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
protection and

208
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
for those of you who are long timers

209
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
within the security space you probably

210
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
remember the day when

211
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
ids became almost no longer relevant and

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
the world was now the ips world

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
we're not there yet but we start seeing

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,240
things that are really becoming um

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
similar to like an ids to ips uh shift

216
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
and customers say yes i i have the

217
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
visibility i know what i have i know

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
what's compliant and what's not i'm

219
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,039
ready to move to the next step where it

220
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,919
is you know real runtime protection

221
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,680
last but not least remember we talked

222
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
about the developers and the devops

223
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
taking a lot of decisions how do i

224
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,719
actually empower them from a security

225
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
perspective and this is all about

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
enabling continuous development in a

227
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,080
secure manner so no longer as a security

228
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,880
person i want to do things

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
only when development has ceased right

230
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
we're in you know

231
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
code is already being committed but

232
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
instead i want to make sure that i'm

233
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,160
enabling developers and devops engineers

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
to secure the code as they build and if

235
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
i'm giving ahead of time i'm telling a

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
developer hey just so you know you're

237
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
writing code you're using a third-party

238
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,920
library that has a vulnerability or you

239
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
forgot as you commit code into the

240
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,120
repository you you forgot to remove

241
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
whatever sales static authentication

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,640
information i'm enabling them to build

243
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
better systems and and this is critical

244
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
because security can't be just for the

245
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
security administrator it has to be

246
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
relevant for the executive leadership on

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
one hand and it has to be relevant for

248
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
the developer community within the

249
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
organization and when i say developers

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,720
developers and devops

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,760
together

252
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,560
now

253
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
when we look at

254
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
those cloud assets and cloud assets

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
could be everything it could be

256
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
virtual machines it could be

257
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,279
containers could be security sorry

258
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,680
serverless functions et cetera et cetera

259
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
these are old islands in the stream it's

260
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
like it's it's just pieces of a bigger

261
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,560
bigger thing which is the application

262
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
eventually

263
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
but now the question is how do i make

264
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
them really islands and the reason i'm

265
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
talking about islands is because

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
an island is best protected when it's

267
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,440
completely disconnected right if no one

268
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,839
can get to it and you have to use you

269
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
know something together and there's no

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
way to get to to an island then it's

271
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
it's perfectly connected and sorry it's

272
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,279
perfectly uh uh protected

273
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
however we need to understand that it's

274
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
not really islands in the stream it's

275
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
not you know vms are not just standing

276
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
in the middle of an ocean doing nothing

277
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
they are connected to different vms they

278
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
are connected to different containers

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
they are connected to um different

280
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
serverless functions and so forth and so

281
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
forth within those those uh um assets

282
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,079
themselves so

283
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,640
if if i can't reach an ass an asset i

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,480
understand it's not valuable so it means

285
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
that i need to build some kind of roads

286
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
just like the the pinkish orangish one

287
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
you see in the middle but how do i make

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
sure that by making such an island an

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
accessible island connecting it with

290
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
different islands that make those um

291
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
applications how do i make sure that i'm

292
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,800
not using or not allowing an adversary

293
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
to use this uh uh this island as a

294
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
as a jumbo

295
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399
and

296
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,200
um

297
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
this is you know where zero trust could

298
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
come to the rescue but the challenge

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,079
with zero trust that it says only what's

300
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,320
a must should be allowed but how do i

301
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
know what's allowed especially when i'm

302
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
not there in day one

303
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
to design a system when actually

304
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,079
developers push and commit new code

305
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
without me knowing when devops engineer

306
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
deploy assets

307
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
as

308
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
they uh as things are as things are

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
being built and not

310
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,839
me knowingly what's what's gonna be

311
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,480
there and um you know i think that it's

312
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
clear we can definitely use ai to gather

313
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
information from developers to get

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,279
information from devops but actually

315
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,160
gather information from the system

316
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,959
itself in order to make it actual

317
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,519
insights something that i could

318
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,480
really

319
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
uh um create

320
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
a network policy a security policy an

321
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
application policy a permission policy

322
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
and the more data i'm putting into the

323
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,279
machine the more accurate it is going to

324
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
become

325
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,920
last but not least we can't and i'll

326
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
talk about a little bit about the old

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,320
world ways of solving uh uh problems we

328
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
need to understand it's a new world

329
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
problem we have to have a new world

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
solution and i think that machine

331
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
learning artificial intelligence that's

332
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
exactly what we need in order to solve

333
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
this new world problem

334
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
now let's talk a little bit about

335
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
network policy network policy is

336
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,320
actually

337
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
defining which host which asset

338
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
could talk to which other asset and

339
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
using what different protocols now

340
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
developers not only know what what is

341
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
being used because sometimes for example

342
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
they um they use pre-built libraries

343
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,079
when they use premium libraries they

344
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,519
don't really know well they ask the

345
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
library to do something and the library

346
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,000
goes out to the internet or goes out to

347
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
another asset and um and fetch whatever

348
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
it needs and return an answer to the

349
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,800
code and we're good another situation is

350
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
where the lab is actually overly

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,920
permissive

352
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
and it means that

353
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
there is nothing that blocks anything so

354
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,160
then the developer doesn't even know

355
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
what's being used or what is not being

356
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,839
used

357
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
blocking completely is not an option

358
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
again as i said like what good is an

359
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,680
island if no one can get to it

360
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
and no one can get out of it we have to

361
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
make sure that we have some kind of

362
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,680
control around what's coming in and

363
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,959
what's up

364
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,279
documenting could be a tedious process

365
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,720
i'll i'll talk in a second about um

366
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,040
what people use in order to document

367
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
network security policy it's a tedious

368
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
process it doesn't respond it's static

369
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
it doesn't respond well to application

370
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
changes which again remember the ci cd

371
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
pipeline i talked about the first slide

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
it's something that constantly changes

373
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
right so we need something

374
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
to document these changes

375
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,440
and actually define this traffic that is

376
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
necessary

377
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,519
but do it in a continuous manner so how

378
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,720
do we do it

379
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
so let's you know take a look at almost

380
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
a traditional

381
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
uh security and devops and developers

382
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,560
meeting where

383
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,320
you know the security uh girl or or

384
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
or person asked you know what network

385
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
security policy does your application

386
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,000
need to operate

387
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,240
no one knows again because they just

388
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,079
it's not part of what they do

389
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,440
on a regular basis when they develop

390
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
and then

391
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
for and again i used to do it

392
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
as a system integration as a system

393
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
integration engineer

394
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,800
tens of years ago we used to just take

395
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,519
logs from firewalls or form routers or

396
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
from what have you put it into an excel

397
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
file again i'm talking about like 20 25

398
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
years ago and then run some whatever

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,920
unique uh um unique identification of

400
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
different flows and build a security

401
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
policy uh out of it surprisingly

402
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
the same top of the line tool is being

403
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,519
used today like people just export

404
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,519
logs and import it into an excel or a

405
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
different way of crunching data

406
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
statically

407
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
however this is not scalable and this

408
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
does not respond well to changes so what

409
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
i want to now show you guys is how

410
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,920
could we actually harness ai in order to

411
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
uh to reach this so what you see here is

412
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
actually a

413
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,759
you know an application built on

414
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
containers um three you know three layer

415
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,959
application nothing that is too um uh

416
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
too complex and the question is how do i

417
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
know what type of of you know what type

418
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,199
of traffic is flowing between

419
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,000
each uh uh area and each host without

420
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
documenting so what we're actually what

421
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,079
we could actually do

422
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,199
is discover the different containers

423
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,000
discover the different uh zones right

424
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
it's done through you know downloading a

425
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,440
home chart i'm not going to take you

426
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
through it uh but but definitely this is

427
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,240
what you do you start understanding

428
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
what's happening on each node

429
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
immediately you understand what

430
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
namespaces do you have what you have how

431
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
many pods you have what pods you have

432
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,440
but this is very this is it doesn't look

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,399
like the diagram uh uh we saw earlier so

434
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,240
actually what we're gonna do in this

435
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
zone we're going to turn on

436
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,959
uh access policy learning

437
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,560
and by the way

438
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,399
we do at the same time we can actually

439
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,560
also turn on things that are of the

440
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,199
threat prevention type without even

441
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,560
looking into

442
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,720
um into anything that's being learned i

443
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
don't need to be

444
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
a genius to use machine learning in

445
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
order to understand that if your code

446
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
tries to connect to a command and

447
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,639
control bot

448
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,399
something is wrong and you know i don't

449
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,799
want to allow it i'm going to disallow

450
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
it on day one right but as i go learning

451
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,199
i can actually now learn within what's

452
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,599
allowed i could actually learn

453
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,439
what different types of um

454
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,599
traffic and protocols are being used

455
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,520
right and this is you know this is very

456
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,439
initial it's only after one hour of

457
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,039
learning right and you see that the

458
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,280
system says hey keep learning

459
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,840
but after it finished learning it shows

460
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
so many zones and show so

461
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,679
sorry so many pods

462
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,799
and it actually is capable of

463
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,559
showing something that looks maybe with

464
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,679
less colors but looks similar to the

465
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
same thing that we saw in a in the

466
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
drawing and this is something that the

467
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,679
machine learning algorithm learned on

468
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,160
its own and then it suggests a security

469
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
policy and says this what you should use

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
in order to support this the nice thing

471
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
is that as

472
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
we move forward actually new application

473
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
changes will be relearned and reinforced

474
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
and we could also identify not only

475
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
what's allowed but also we can identify

476
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,360
anomalies between this and things that

477
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
are not are not

478
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,679
allowed it's not just a yes and no is it

479
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
allowed or not it's much more than that

480
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
now now that we allowed other you know

481
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
we allowed some different islands from

482
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,679
talking uh um

483
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,160
the wrong things and just allowing you

484
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
know the right

485
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
types of protocols to to kind of uh pass

486
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,679
between the islands this the thing is

487
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
okay i'm allowing for example

488
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,880
my

489
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
uh my serverless function to access an

490
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
s3 bucket

491
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,799
but

492
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,120
but what does it mean

493
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
what does it is it is it

494
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,919
enough to say okay this serverless

495
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
function could access this

496
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,360
other service

497
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,679
it's definitely not because we have so

498
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,679
many access types and maybe the service

499
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,760
function for example needs only a read

500
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,799
only

501
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,160
from the s3 bucket so do i completely

502
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
allow everything or am i actually

503
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
allowing just read only and if i only

504
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
want to re to allow read only how do i

505
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,559
know exactly what it's uh um

506
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,919
what is required

507
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
so how would a security person know

508
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,600
exactly to take the right decision and

509
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
yet again we have another meeting with

510
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
the security person sitting together

511
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,919
with the developers and the devops

512
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,760
engineers and asking like okay what

513
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
permissions do you need on this database

514
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
on this s3 bucket

515
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
on this other serverless function you're

516
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,440
trying to you're trying to um um

517
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,559
to use

518
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
while running this specific vm or

519
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
service functions are or what have you

520
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
and there's a lot of pushback developers

521
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
would say things like well yes currently

522
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
we only read data from the database but

523
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
but what if i need to change something

524
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
do i need to ask for your permission i

525
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
don't want to delay deployment of the

526
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,799
new version because you don't you didn't

527
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,799
give it to me right and then the

528
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,240
question is like why are you so petty

529
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
why do we need why do we need more than

530
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,559
just this because i want access to the

531
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,440
entire

532
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
database and the question is how do i

533
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,360
continue securing access but still

534
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
maintaining agility and flexibility and

535
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
this is again where machine learning and

536
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,120
ai comes into um into play so let's look

537
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
at actually how do i take along the

538
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
function

539
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
immediately map the different using you

540
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
know just using static code evaluation

541
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
right sorry static code analysis how do

542
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
i actually analyze and understand the

543
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,320
lab the function what does it uh uh talk

544
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
with

545
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
and then i can look at the i am policy

546
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,480
and say okay these are all the these are

547
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,240
all the um the resources that this

548
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,440
lambda function accesses now because

549
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
i could actually take the code and run

550
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,760
machine learning algorithms that model

551
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
everything that the code might do and

552
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,880
position them in different paths in

553
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,720
different journeys they could take

554
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,120
against scientific resources i could

555
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,559
actually tell you listen you're too open

556
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
comparing what you really need and what

557
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
you have configured

558
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
but this is not enough as you as you

559
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
remember well do i need to be petty and

560
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,000
say like oh this is not enough i want to

561
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
tell you

562
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
what you know what's bad

563
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
actually you want because the machine

564
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
learning model actually modeled the

565
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
required permission model and the

566
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,919
effective permission model not only i

567
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,919
could calculate the delta i could

568
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,840
provide the security person a yaml

569
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
snippet which is exactly what the

570
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,039
developers have developed

571
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,960
the devops engineer use in order to

572
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
configure those resources right and i

573
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,120
can use it to provide the

574
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,039
developer with exactly what they need to

575
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,559
do in order to fix this right so

576
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,880
listen we got from you know not knowing

577
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,000
nothing to knowing everything now let's

578
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
summarize

579
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,679
we need to remember that we have a lot

580
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,600
of data right and just looking at the

581
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
data and you know having a developer

582
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
devops sending more logs

583
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,559
to a sim or something similar is not

584
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,400
really going to add any visibility or

585
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,559
insights right so what we actually need

586
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,600
to do

587
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
is

588
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,799
we need to use machine learning and ai

589
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
correctly in order to model

590
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
policies and look a lot about you know

591
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,280
how actual usage is being is uh being

592
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,520
run and then compare it to what's

593
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,880
effectively

594
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
configured and suggest

595
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
changes and this has to happen

596
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
constantly it's a continuous uh um

597
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,720
bridge that kind of bridges the gap

598
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,799
between what security knows and what

599
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,600
devops know and one last thing is

600
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
remember that as i said it's continuous

601
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,559
so when developers need to change

602
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,840
something it might change the

603
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
requirement from a policy perspective

604
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
and with that

605
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
i'll bring it back to gene if we have

606
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
any questions more than happy to to

607
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,918
answer
