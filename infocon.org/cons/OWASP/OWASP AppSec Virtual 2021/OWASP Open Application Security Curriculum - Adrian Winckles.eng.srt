[Music]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,080
and uh good afternoon everyone um just

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,559
tips off um i'm talking today on the

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,559
omask open application security

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,200
curriculum project

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
um

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,760
as i was introduced um my name is adrian

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,480
winkles you can reach me on any of these

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
email addresses

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,039
and obviously for further questions

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,080
at the end

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,439
just a bit

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
about me um

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,000
i've been involved with os since

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
uh about 2011 2012.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,000
um i lead the cambridge chapter in the

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,879
uk i'm on the european board and i'm

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
also chair of the education committee

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
and there's a whole range of other

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,840
research interests that i have

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
ranging from apsec through to cyber

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,079
crime and various other things

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,960
okay so

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,399
you're just probably wondering why i've

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,319
put swiss cheese up um now all the time

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,600
we treat security like swiss cheese we

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
add layers and layers and layers on top

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
of each other

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
and we still don't solve the problems

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
of data breaches we still don't solve

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
the problem um

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,880
all the different types of attack that

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,840
we have

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,119
um

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
how is this relevant

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
to application security

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,000
let's i think

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
if we go on

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,079
so

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
we've got a lot of problems

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,520
the whole

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,439
security space i could say the word

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
cyber

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,680
we know about infrastructure we've

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,399
covered infrastructure to death

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,159
um

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,040
we've

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,479
we've done lots of things with the

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
operating systems with patching that

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
we've never patched before

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
it's not just about what we know it's

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,680
not just about what we don't know in

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
terms of zero days

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,159
um some of it's how we use what we've

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,360
got

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
we use we're not doing proper cyber

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
hygiene but a lot of the problem is

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
about applications

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,598
the application is having a problem

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,080
hence the reason we're all here talking

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
today

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,239
don't just take my word for it

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
gartner have said in recent years 75

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
of security breaches happen at the

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
application

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
over 70 security vulnerabilities exist

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,400
at the application layer not the network

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
layer

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
if we removed

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
just fifty percent

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
uh of the software vulnerabilities prior

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
to production

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
our costs could be greatly reduced but

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
seventy-five percent this is darkness

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,160
and this isn't just me

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
and

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
from this point of view

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,840
92 percent of reported vulnerabilities

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
are in the applications not the network

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
that's an interesting statistic and

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
we'll break that down a bit more in a

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
minute

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,120
and

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
the whole sort of devsecops theme of

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
shift left

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
remember the cost of fixing a bug

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
in the field

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
versus fixing it during

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
the coding process is comparison between

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
thirty thousand dollars to five thousand

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
it's better to fix it

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
during the development process and not

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
just by a pen test at the end of a final

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
product

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
so

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
this is where the 92 percent comes from

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
92 percent of reported vulnerabilities

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
and applications not networks

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
we've covered the network side of things

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
i'd almost said to death

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
things still get through but we have

102
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
those layers we have those layers of

103
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,280
swiss cheese already it's the

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
application

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,959
that's the problem

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
applications are a big issue the trend

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,040
is always towards vulnerabilities in the

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
software and this is

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
compounded now because we have

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
multiple

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
layers of our applications

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,879
um because we've got

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,840
iot networks it could be in sensors

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
we've got mobile platforms

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,798
we've got the concentrating hubs we've

116
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,239
got the cloud back end

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
we tend to build vulnerabilities in

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
unsafe libraries and safe development

119
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,880
environments because

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
security isn't considered early enough

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
in the development process

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
the problem can be open source it can be

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
proprietary

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
and there's been various

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
issues over the years and there continue

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
to be issues over the years

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
we know

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
that if we start doing

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
pen tests at the end of our development

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
if we do two weeks of pen tests a year

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,720
on our application there's still 10

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
magmaps of

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
stuff under the surface

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
there's all the code floors security

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,120
errors business logic floors that can

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
all be in

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,440
hidden

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,320
under what's visible

139
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,560
so why those application

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,039
application functions still occurring

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
typically we still have this chat on we

142
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
still have this gap

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
security professionals don't know

144
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
applications

145
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840
application qa professionals don't know

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
security

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,759
and so how do we bridge that gap

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,800
have a think of that for a minute

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
if we took weinberg's second law in

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,360
terms of application vulnerabilities if

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
builders built buildings the same way

152
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,199
programs right programs the first

153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
woodpecker that came along would destroy

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
civilization so

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
fundamentally sometimes we're building

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,919
on

157
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,280
very poor foundations

158
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
so how do we fix these problems

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
we need security analysts to understand

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
the information held in the application

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
understand the types of views this is

162
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
half the battle

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
and that might involve

164
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
involving the analyst with the design

165
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,600
phase the whole shift left idea

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,840
what about the

167
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,280
developer um

168
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
they need to embrace secure application

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
development

170
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
bake security into frameworks when you

171
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
can and the quality is not just does it

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
work

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
security is

174
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,759
a measure of quality as well

175
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,680
from a qa perspective

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
security vulnerabilities need to be

177
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
considered like bugs the same way you

178
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,039
think for function but contract in the

179
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,639
same manner

180
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
from a management board point of view

181
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,039
factors and time into the project plan

182
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,560
for security

183
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,880
consider security as an added value in

184
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
application

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,280
um

186
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,800
if you like for that one dollar spent

187
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
up front

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,919
you save ten dollars during development

189
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,680
or a hundred dollars after release

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
so we can look at this

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
from a bottom-up

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
problem point of view

193
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
developers don't have time to test

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
adequately if at all developers don't

195
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
know secured coding practices

196
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
there's always this pressure to be first

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
to market

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
and

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,440
often using untested

200
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,199
customized off-the-shelf components to

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
libraries you tend to save time and

202
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
money

203
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
the bottom-up solution

204
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,639
can be about

205
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,919
education

206
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,319
developers taught secure coding

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,599
techniques

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,960
whether this is

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
during university whether it's part of

210
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,720
revision programs as part of

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,319
ongoing education for your development

212
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,400
teams um

213
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
it could be about testing not just

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,199
functionality or user experience

215
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
but security built in first principles

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
we've heard today and yesterday about

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
things like introducing threat modeling

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
into your programs

219
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
it's also sanitizing third-party

220
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
products and libraries testing

221
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
throughout the software development life

222
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,720
cycle

223
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,520
white box testing not just black boxes

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,400
pen testing at the end

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,680
we also have

226
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
top down problems

227
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,320
from a board management perspective

228
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,479
pressure to be first to market

229
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,000
focusing on product features and new

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
experience not security

231
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,279
cost reduction ignoring security risks

232
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
security not being seen as a boardroom

233
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,600
priority and the lack of an

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
organizational security culture

235
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
now

236
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,120
top-down solutions

237
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
also involve education

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
educating the boardroom of senior

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
management is a necessity to build

240
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,519
security in from the parks

241
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
that education means appointing a site

242
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
of the board developing an

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
organizational security culture

244
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
so at some point you need a top-down and

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
a bottom-up approach you need that

246
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
equilibrium

247
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
now the important point here this is

248
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,399
what brings me on to the

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,519
um

250
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
application security curriculum

251
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
is that you need to educate to build

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,160
security in

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
you can't take it at a given

254
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
there has to be

255
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
a dedicated program to educate

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
your security people about applications

257
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,480
your developers about

258
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
security

259
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
and you have to meet somewhere in the

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
middle so this is the key point

261
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
education needs to be at the key part of

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
it

263
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
so there's a need for this education

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
it could be as simple as educating users

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,519
security awareness program because after

266
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,959
all security is everyone's

267
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
responsibility

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,279
now we need to educate developers

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,480
we need secure coding

270
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
target under 16s

271
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
further education

272
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
higher education

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
continuous education

274
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
revisiting for your development teams

275
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
revisiting for your security analysts

276
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,839
um

277
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,880
needs this needs to be embedded into

278
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
computer science curriculums

279
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
there has been some practice there's

280
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,800
been

281
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
some professional bodies both in the uk

282
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
europe and some in the us

283
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
have communities of practice

284
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
initiative to bring

285
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
secure coding

286
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
in line with some of these programs

287
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
um

288
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
we are working now on a

289
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
application security curriculum

290
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,640
framework

291
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
and we'll come up to this shortly and

292
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,120
people like cysek crest have academic

293
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,920
frameworks as well

294
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,440
and

295
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
taking the existing generation of

296
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
developers

297
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,480
having secure coding programs workshops

298
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
revision follow-ups

299
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
if you like a dog isn't just for

300
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,160
christmas

301
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
so there's a need for education

302
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
you test your qa testing functions

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,920
testing throughout the stl sclc the

304
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,760
software development lifecycle not just

305
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,800
at the end

306
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,839
incorporating some of the

307
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,279
obash projects testing guide asvs

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
the board needs to be educated educate

309
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
board member members to build security

310
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,399
from the start

311
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,560
as a benefit

312
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,760
and

313
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,079
security is everyone's responsibility so

314
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
where does this take us so

315
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
remember what olaf's main purpose is to

316
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,920
be the thriving global community

317
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
that drives

318
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
visibility and evolution in the safety

319
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,040
and security of the world software

320
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
then the part of our key mission is to

321
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
educate not just the current generation

322
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
of developers or infosec professionals

323
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
but also the next generation

324
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
particularly in the context of

325
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,279
acknowledge

326
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,480
shortage of skills in our sector

327
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,760
see part of the problem is

328
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,200
in our

329
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
existing

330
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,360
security education programs whether

331
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
that's cyber infosec or traditional

332
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
computer science programs we don't

333
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,959
address application security adequately

334
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,800
if at all

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
some regions has been attempts

336
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
to justice deficit in the uk isc squared

337
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
bcs has been working on initiative to

338
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
embed

339
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
secure coding within the computer

340
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,839
science curriculum

341
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,639
um

342
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,560
again that emphasis on secure coding

343
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
techniques

344
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
and again that's something i've been

345
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
involved in the uk as well

346
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
champing those initiatives

347
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
but

348
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
the aim of the

349
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
os open application security curriculum

350
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
project is i think we have an

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
opportunity to coordinate

352
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,399
our diverse expertise a lot of the os

353
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
projects other interested parties

354
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
and these types of patent logic programs

355
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
and initiatives so we have an

356
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
educational strategy that meets the

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
skill expectations required by industry

358
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,320
so part of my working session

359
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,079
is to explore

360
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,760
the possibility of overall having an

361
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,240
educational strategy for security

362
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,800
programs

363
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
but also looking

364
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,560
at a requirement for industry in terms

365
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
of training providers

366
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
schools

367
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,279
and re-education programs all those sort

368
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,240
of things

369
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
um

370
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,279
come under a limit

371
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,279
so

372
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,720
where do we go

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,279
this next

374
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
so what aspects of application security

375
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,959
and skills does industry need

376
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,120
there's got to be some sort of

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
um gap analysis

378
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,800
um

379
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,959
understanding what the different parts

380
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
of the sector and the industry actually

381
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
require

382
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
so what problems relating to application

383
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
security is the next generation of

384
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
graduate software's computer scientists

385
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,839
and security analysts need to solve

386
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,639
so

387
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,519
what we really want to do is have a set

388
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,040
of learning objectives

389
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
for bachelors for master's levels and

390
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
application security curricula

391
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,720
and

392
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,199
that set of curricula that can be used

393
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,839
for a whole range of educational and

394
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
training providers it's not just

395
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,920
academia this is industry as well

396
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
but we're also forgetting about

397
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,079
something

398
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,800
one of the things os is known for is its

399
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
projects

400
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,680
we have some excellent projects out

401
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
there we have industry leading projects

402
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,519
that both guide help train

403
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,440
but where we probably

404
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,320
don't succeed is linking those projects

405
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
together

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
into a coherent program to say if you

407
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,079
want to know this

408
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
use this

409
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,160
if you want to go there use that

410
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,759
we've got cheat sheets

411
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,320
we've got various top tens we've got a

412
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,560
lot of documentation and a lot of

413
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
supporting

414
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
educational products but there's nothing

415
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
that actually ties it together

416
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,519
also

417
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,240
we want to determine a mechanism by

418
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
which

419
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,040
regional or local deliverance of a

420
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,120
curriculum should be supported by the

421
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
operas community

422
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
this could be

423
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
our supporters from chapters or projects

424
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,479
could sit on

425
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
training panels to determine

426
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,199
training criteria

427
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,800
could be a critical friend or module

428
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,279
design do things like guest lectures

429
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,000
training academics train the trainer

430
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,519
we have a chance to engage in those

431
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,360
educational communities

432
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
and a lot of supporters do

433
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
but we don't know who does what where

434
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
and when

435
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
we'll come on to that

436
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
in a while

437
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,079
so what's my project proposal potential

438
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,199
bid initiative if you like

439
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,959
my first objective

440
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,560
is is this

441
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,079
establish a core set of learning

442
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,320
objectives for an application security

443
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
curriculum

444
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
this if you like defines the educational

445
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
requirements necessitated by industry

446
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
has to be industry-led

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,119
because we're supplying

448
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
students

449
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,039
to meet industry needs or retraining

450
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,799
existing developers and security

451
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,000
analysts

452
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,640
um to meet the next generation of secure

453
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
software development environments etc

454
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,039
so what we've got to do is undertake a

455
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,640
gap analysis

456
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
of existing and missing curricula

457
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
learn to meet the requirements outlined

458
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,120
by industry

459
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
there's been a lot of work on generic

460
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,600
cyber or generic infosec

461
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
curriculums but we haven't really done

462
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
application security

463
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
and who asked is the

464
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
recognized

465
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,280
ex industry expertise

466
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,480
in application security

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
so we can do this with liaison with

468
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,320
industry professional bodies

469
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,080
and existing state-of-the-art literature

470
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,440
second objective

471
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
to praise the state-of-the-art

472
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
application teaching resources and

473
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,919
determine areas of non-coverage again

474
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
gap analysis

475
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
existing and missing teaching resources

476
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,799
we already have some

477
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,000
we have

478
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
world leading

479
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,360
projects that support the apsec

480
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,039
industry

481
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,960
we have juice shop

482
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
security shepard

483
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
web goats today but a few

484
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,520
again

485
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
achieve things like discovery workshops

486
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,000
industry links focus groups

487
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,679
that type of approach

488
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,640
third objective is to recommend an

489
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
application

490
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,120
security open curriculum for industry

491
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
has to be open

492
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
this is something people take

493
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,360
and shape

494
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
to adapt to what they need but we

495
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
develop it from

496
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,760
centrally os expertise

497
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
so we produce and disseminate a learning

498
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
skills framework

499
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,480
this is the idea to empower academia to

500
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
support industry in the problems they

501
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,679
face

502
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,760
both for the current generation and the

503
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
next generation of software devs

504
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,960
computer scientists security analysts in

505
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
our devsecops approach

506
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
this open framework can be expected to

507
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
address teaching requirements

508
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,559
undergraduate postgraduate apprentice

509
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
and industry certification level

510
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
training requirements

511
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
and it isn't

512
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
this is

513
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
us

514
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,360
taking a lead but it isn't just that

515
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,600
there are other key influences there's

516
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
lots of

517
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
our sponsors

518
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
those people that

519
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,559
our students go and work for

520
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
and the professional bodies

521
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,520
this is international

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,039
to name but a few

525
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,280
and objective four which is always going

526
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,559
to be ongoing

527
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
is an opportunity for us to pull

528
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
together all of its wide-ranging

529
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,799
expertise its projects

530
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,039
and its dedicated volunteers to engage

531
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,640
in these types of education programs

532
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
initiatives

533
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,159
by having this strategy

534
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
mapping our projects to learning

535
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,200
objectives

536
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
the one thing that i think is still

537
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
missing

538
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
for robot is

539
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,960
linking its projects

540
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
to

541
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
requirements

542
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,440
some people know where to go

543
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,679
let me share something with you

544
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,200
this was a

545
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,440
um

546
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,400
an infographic that i came across back

547
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,480
in 2015.

548
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
i think it was buried very very deeply

549
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,039
but i was partly been impressed by it

550
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,400
and it says it's a quick developer's

551
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,799
guide which is basically if you want to

552
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,360
know this go here if you want to know

553
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,520
that go there

554
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,320
and it was

555
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,600
an initial attempt almost at

556
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,280
these are the resources

557
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
this is what you want to know

558
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
these are things you can use

559
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
in other words i really think this is

560
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
what do we do this but from an

561
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,320
educational framework point of view

562
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
so

563
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
you become the beneficiaries

564
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,600
of this research

565
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
in this um approach

566
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,240
as well as having an indirect impact

567
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
on the sort of global

568
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,799
cybersecurity skill set immediate

569
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,200
benefits of this research would be

570
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,799
any

571
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,880
global industrial organization of

572
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
internet facing applications

573
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
they would benefit from an open

574
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
curriculum that's been shaped by

575
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,679
industry

576
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
because it helps to address

577
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
what they need

578
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,600
for their next generation of developers

579
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,559
and security staff

580
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
both global academic and specialist

581
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
training providers benefit from a

582
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,840
teaching framework

583
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,240
because it allows them to target

584
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,039
the application security skills that

585
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,080
industry requires

586
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
international professional policy

587
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,159
members benefit from more focused

588
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,760
accreditation

589
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
certification program

590
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
and this is something that obviously os

591
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,320
is working on as well um

592
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
my colleague grant has spoken on this

593
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,799
before

594
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
again it has

595
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
international populations

596
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,280
through better protection of citizens

597
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
workforce critical infrastructure

598
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,039
internet-enabled technologies and

599
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
applications

600
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,679
and

601
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,400
international economic prospects

602
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,159
employment benefits because there's more

603
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,960
available skilled employees to draw from

604
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
we keep hearing about skill shortages

605
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
not enough people trained

606
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,039
if we have a curricula we can target the

607
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,158
skills that people need

608
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,520
this is all intended to have

609
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
a proper impact

610
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
we have

611
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,559
i.t security professionals software

612
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,200
developers trained

613
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
for

614
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,240
an industry relevant and trusted because

615
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
of an open standard

616
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
that everyone can adhere to

617
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,159
and we can develop those skills for

618
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,080
future application security threats

619
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,919
we can have

620
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,720
global industrial organizations that

621
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,240
have internet-facing applications

622
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
that have their development teams

623
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
trained to have those applications with

624
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
security built in

625
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
security will be at the heart of the

626
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
development lifecycle it's not going to

627
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
be an afterthought

628
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,400
again globally academic institutions

629
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,720
specialist training providers

630
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,039
provide new industry relevant degrees

631
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,039
and diplomas and bespoke training

632
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,400
programs

633
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,799
that have been internationally endorsed

634
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,400
part of an application security

635
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
framework

636
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,919
again professional bodies support with

637
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,960
their respective frameworks and skills

638
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,120
again more focused accreditation

639
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,559
certification programs that meet

640
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
their users needs

641
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
and

642
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
the overall skill set of security

643
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,039
professionals software developers

644
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,679
internationally

645
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
means that

646
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,279
things like critical infrastructure

647
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
internet enabled intolerances

648
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
internet enabled technologies

649
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
all the applications are better

650
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,679
protected

651
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
again and overall

652
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,799
it enhances the international skill set

653
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,240
so

654
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
what are the next steps what can we do

655
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,039
oh

656
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,200
one of the things is you want to bolster

657
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
the education committee

658
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
we have some key members working there

659
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,640
but more people

660
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
are useful

661
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,000
i think there's a need to better

662
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,159
understand what has been provided in

663
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,919
education's

664
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,320
settings and what overlap's relation to

665
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
education is

666
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,720
one of the things i'd like to ask the

667
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,520
our staff to do via the board

668
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
is

669
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
to reenact

670
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
having a database of application

671
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,279
security chain trainers again this might

672
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,760
help with certification

673
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,679
branch of what we do as well

674
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,360
um

675
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
a database of academic supporters and

676
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,559
contacts and a mechanism to keep them up

677
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,840
to date

678
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,440
so at all levels

679
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
a database of project leaders supporting

680
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,159
academic curriculums modules projects

681
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,960
so where are our projects being used

682
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,640
i know what tools i use

683
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,120
i extensively use a lot of os projects

684
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,400
in terms of the programs that i put

685
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,919
together i use security shepherd

686
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
i use web code

687
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,039
i use zap

688
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,159
um i use g shop

689
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,840
to name but a few

690
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,919
as well as top 10

691
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
cheat sheets

692
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,919
asvs

693
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,760
where else are they being used

694
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,799
i don't think we know

695
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,559
also

696
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,200
a database of chapter leaders supporting

697
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,760
academic programs or offering talks and

698
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
supporting

699
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,240
training programs

700
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,559
we have an intended outline ideas

701
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,799
proposal

702
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,640
we need funding

703
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,600
i've got some ideas about funding bids

704
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
i've been talking to some people

705
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
but this needs to be looked at from an

706
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,239
international perspective

707
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,880
we're going to need to do

708
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,720
questionnaires

709
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
but what questions do we ask

710
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,600
target audience maybe the leaders list

711
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
the community list

712
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,120
this is someone who can pass around all

713
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,919
chapters how do we reach trainers how do

714
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,080
we reach the other universities who are

715
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,880
using os content

716
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
and how do we then map those out

717
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,320
projects to our objectives

718
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,200
so

719
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,840
in a way

720
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,279
i've talked a lot

721
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,559
about

722
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,200
what i'd like to do

723
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,760
but i'd also like to

724
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,440
talk a lot about

725
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,320
talks about answer questions about

726
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,080
what people's thoughts are

727
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,840
is this

728
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,200
something you'd like to get behind

729
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,799
something like you like to be involved

730
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,520
in

731
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,720
is this something that

732
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,640
is needed i certainly think it is but

733
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
i'd like

734
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
to have more sort of feedback on to

735
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,320
where we'd like to take this we're like

736
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,840
likely to go

737
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
um and i'd really like to stress this

738
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,679
isn't just about

739
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,440
doing

740
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
um

741
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,679
bachelors or master's level questions

742
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,840
it's about industry training as well

743
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,600
i've targeted particularly

744
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
bachelor to masters because i have a

745
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
particular requirement for that but an

746
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,919
open curriculum is there to support all

747
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,720
so i finished a little bit early um
