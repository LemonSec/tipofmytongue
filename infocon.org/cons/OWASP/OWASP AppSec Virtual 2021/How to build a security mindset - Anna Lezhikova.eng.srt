and i moved to new zealand from russia

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
nine years ago and here started so

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,519
i t so before

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
before in russia i

10

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,079
making babies might be a little bit

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,680

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
fast career from front and full stack

that

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,599
we are

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,760
growing so fast hiring

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
expanding products expanding time zones

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
countries all of it and

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,480
work with a lot of banks and other

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,560
financial corporations it means that

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
they start this company who started the

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
startup and didn't even think

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,640
about having a security person now uh

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,160
considering this very seriously and

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
i'm very happy to walk in there because

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,760
it's such a

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,800
green field and a lot of opportunities

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
to start

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
it right not to deal with legacy but

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,920
this is from technology point of view uh

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,000
and what this talk is about is about

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
people

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
so people are not so easy

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
to change and you can't start from

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
scratch with them so that's what we will

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
talking about here

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
so

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
uh

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,879
sorry what we've got in here uh

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
people from the company point of view

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
it's not only engineers it's all

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
employees and

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
for employees uh what i find lacking

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
is

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,640
fear

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
and fear is of just because not knowing

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
not being attacked

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,760
if you didn't walk in them

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
company that uh was under ransom attack

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
or it was not affected directly or even

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,799
if you worked in this company it was so

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,239
huge that it just

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,159
was not affected directly

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,120
then

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
all of these scary stories are just news

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
and like one example when we were

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
walking in a shared space at the

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
beginning when we didn't have our office

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,560
in congo

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
um we worked in co-working space and

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
one um day i just stayed longer and

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,439
there was a

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,519
computer left on the desk from one of

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,319
the employees and uh it was open

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
uh there was a screen share saver and i

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
was

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,360
must have been locked and i touched it

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
touch screen it was not locked because

110
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,358
she thought that she had a lock but

111
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,000
their screen server lock was set up for

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
five hours so six hours something like

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,639
this and it's a co-working space

114
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,960
anyone can walk in walk out yeah this

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
type of things

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
on the other hand we've got developers

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,199
who often especially

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
expert ones senior ones that are so

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,479
overconfident that they know that

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,040
sometimes they just sometimes uh have to

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
ask you please prove me how it can be

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
hacked then i will believe you that we

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
will need to secure it if i don't know

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
how it can be hacked

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
this is not true at all right

126
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
so um

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
we

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
know about this problems and open

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
computers um shared passwords um

130
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,320
we

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,360
try to train there's a lot of education

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,840
i worked in a bank and we regularly had

133
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
this

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,479
courses that you had to

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
complete with the multiple questions in

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
them that you had to get

137
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
right correct

138
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,680
and uh then you've got this check

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
um

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
passed it uh

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
but there's just there's no use at all i

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
mean like how you can even

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
relate it what you just read on the

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
slides to what you're doing day-to-day

145
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,440
job

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
just like yeah it's good for compliance

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
you know they're not taking place for

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,520
training but no practical

149
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
usage in there but uh

150
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
for

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,759
security training and other stuff and

152
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
quite a lot of courses like this and

153
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,280
then people just like

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
find them as obstacle courses that they

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,360
just have to do and just forget about it

156
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
uh later we've got some improvements in

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
there they now look more fun

158
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
they've got some interactions some maybe

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,720
fun animations but still same obstacle

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
course that just people

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,159
go through and forget

162
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,800
uh

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
that's what that's when people started

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
to talk about like mindset it's not only

165
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
about security i'm sure you've heard of

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,919
growth mindset of different mindset that

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,639
mindset we need if you want to change it

168
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,160
attitude to something you need to change

169
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
mindset

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
so what is mindset

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,199
yeah this is google the established set

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
of attitudes held by someone

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,600

but in practice

193
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,160
how do we do this

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
there we go i don't know

195
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,159
let's make a detour

196
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
in

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
what was that in in april yes it was

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
april 20

199
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
21.

200
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
uh new zealand was not already in

201
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
lockdown at that moment so i'm not in

202
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
auckland i'm not in lockdown have some

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
freedoms from covered stuff

204
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
but this was like when there's no covet

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,599
in the country but all covered all over

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,160
the world and there is a program in new

207
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
zealand called hakua

208
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,720
that provided

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
education

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,039
uh with credits for american students so

211
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,520
american students would come here

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,479
they would work uh in some companies of

213
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
volunteers doing social good then they

214
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,039
would travel the country visit um local

215
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
evs stripe in maori

216
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
and uh learn their

217
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,478

218
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
view of the world all the stuff

219
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,839
and uh then they would go to some place

220
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
stay there for a couple of weeks and

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,640
write the same paper so it was offered

222
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,920
only for american students but kovid

223
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,720
came and the program closed because no

224
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
one could come to new zealand

225
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
so they decided to offer it to local

226
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,839
people and because uh our company

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,760
provided space for these volunteers i've

228
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
got an invite and decided okay why not

229
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
to go

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
so i went there

231
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
i stayed in an um

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
uh

233
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
eevee uh nathirani uh even means tribe

234

235
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
and uh

236
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
for three days it was there stayed in

237
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,560
marae so sleeping in a big

238
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,839
hut

239
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,720
all together on the floor mattresses

240
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
and

241
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,720
they

242
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
took us to the

243
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,880
local area

244
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,080
showed it to us and talked about the

245
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
beliefs and um traditions

246
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,920
so this is are the montreal pejorates

247
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,880
the

248
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
center of north island or new zealand

249
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
i'll have a map later or a small map of

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
this area so you'll know better but this

251
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,839
is the

252
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,080
ah by the way i'm not sure it's the

253
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
tallest uh mountain of north island

254
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,079
uh and it's a former volcano

255
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
i'm not sure how much active it is but

256
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
other parts of the tongariro it's called

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
tongariro uh

258
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
chino mountains and this is mountain

259
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
mount

260
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
it's the name of the town

261
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
and we went there uh

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
it was very very beautiful and they talk

263
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
about us

264
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
talk to us about the mountain and that

265
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
how it

266
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,120
connects to their

267
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,839
world that when you die your spirit will

268
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
go up to the mountain so it means all

269
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,959
ancestors go through this and then

270
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,320
to the uh

271
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
outer world and that this is a sacred

272
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,680
place there's a lot of uh like the ice

273
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
in there when it melts

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,399
it

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
uh goes um

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,279
just

277
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
from this sacred space that's just

278
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
connection between our world and

279
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
ancestors

280
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
out of world

281
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,320
yeah it was amazing there was rainbow

282
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,920
look for a couple of hours just

283
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
appearing disappearing

284
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,880
and uh

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,720
this ice melting goes down

286
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
through in rivers in the form of rivers

287
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,440
and the mountain rivers and then we

288
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,760
looked at this and

289
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,519
this area is sacred so this point is uh

290
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,839
where we were like allowed to go and we

291
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,079
were not allowed to go further

292
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,839
because this is like whenever you're

293
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,600
going there you

294
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,640
become

295
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,959
you're present in there and present not

296
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,000
only for the stones and stuff but also

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,079
for the all the spirits and um

298
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,279
energy and all the things in there and

299
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,600
and you should not disturb the space if

300
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
you're not allowed to

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
uh then after this place like mountain

302
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,800
we went to the river

303
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
and this is water from ice melting

304
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,200
and

305
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,760
rivers also got

306
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,399
some spirits you can talk to them you

307
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,880
can pet them so let's try your next to

308
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,600
the river try to

309
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,880
uh just touch it like you are

310
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,360
painting a dog or cat something like

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,279
this and you will feel it it's very

312
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
interesting feeling

313
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,440
and uh this

314
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,040
water not only life from the

315
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
biology point of view like environment

316
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
point of view but also

317
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,639
life

318
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,000
continuous

319
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,880
from

320
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
spiritual point of view

321
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
then we went to the forest

322
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,959
and

323
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,839
this rivers they feed all of this life

324
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,240
this water is everywhere

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
and uh

326
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
yeah this is new zealand forest my

327
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,360
favorite place on planet

328
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,560
when we're open please come and visit

329
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,480
let me open uh

330
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
and all this is fed and again not just

331
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
water but also spirit and means that we

332
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
are also

333
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
90 something percent of water

334
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
and this water is not or not all the

335
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
molecules it's full of all other stuff

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
in there so that's how they see the

337
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,480
world in holistic view that everything

338
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
is a part of everything else and it's

339
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,079
not just

340
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,880
it's not just parts it's a one big thing

341
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
interconnected

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,360
and uh

343
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,240
this is very very very

344
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
life changing experience just to feel

345
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
how how i see the world how i feel

346
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,199
myself and the world

347
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
uh and then they showed us uh a place

348
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
and told us a story

349
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
so this is treated by tanki when uh

350
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
crown

351
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
bought the lands from maori

352
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
and uh started doing things on it

353
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
because like crown thought now we own

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,839
the land we can do things and

355
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,040
in uh

356
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,639
20th century

357
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,680
uh i'm

358
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,279
like i'm not sure exactly what was the

359
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,720
year but 70s the project started in 50s

360
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
it was called big think project

361
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
and um

362
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
this exact project was started i'm not

363
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,440
sure 70s or 80s or something that is

364
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,079
like 50 years ago almost 50 years ago

365
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,560
and this is the uh you can't see my

366
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
cursor right on the screen

367
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
dogma

368
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
yes we can see your screen awesome okay

369
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
no i mean like the cursor my mouse

370
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,760
cursor yes yes awesome so this is mount

371
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
rape who are talking about this is don

372
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
guerrero or mountain and this is

373
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,720
mountain guerrero and this mountain

374
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,440
no

375
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
it's the famous you've if you watched

376
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
lord of the rings you've seen it this is

377
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
mordo

378
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,839
this mountain

379
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,480
so this is what's in the movie

380
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
and uh this is a rivers and the river i

381
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
showed you is uh

382
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
i think this one

383
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,519
not sure but one of this one this one

384
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,720
so this water melts in here goes for

385
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,279
this mountains go to the rivers uh goes

386
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,399
in here

387
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,199
these dots are catchments i'll have it

388
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
not a very good but still picture of it

389
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
so where water

390
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
goes into from the river into the um

391
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,360
tunnel and they're 21 or 24 of them

392
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,240
something like this and then uh all this

393
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
water

394
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,399
from the catchments go into this um

395
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,519
aqueduct

396
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,680
then it goes to this dam then there is a

397
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,000
huge huge tunnel going here and here and

398
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,079
then there are power stations

399
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,040
and then it goes to this lake finally in

400
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,199
lake taupa and you can sit on this

401
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
there's a river coming out of the lake

402
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,600
topper and there is six or eight more

403
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,560
power stations and all these to produce

404
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,440
energy electricity

405
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,399
uh

406
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
what does not see uh sure like yeah good

407
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
electricity this is the green

408
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
electricity uh that we want to uh

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,440
promote more uh com like uh opposite to

410
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,959
coal oil

411
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,839
uh by the way that's one of the reasons

412
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
why aws is building data center in uh

413
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
new zealand uh and google cloud is

414
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,839
almost like i'm not sure if they're

415
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,440
building it or not but they're opening

416
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,079
one but aws is building one

417
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,480
because this is the green

418
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
uh energy that will uh help them to

419
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,839
become

420
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,279
um carbon

421
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,839
uh zero not neutral carbon zero that

422
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,759
they clay all three column clouds

423
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
claimed to be by twenty thirty

424
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
uh

425
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,279
and this water and here just okay some

426
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,600
catchments water goes in but how it

427
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
looks in real life

428
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,199
so this is these are two catchments from

429
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
this one so here uh it's not very good

430
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
picture sorry

431
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,319
that i was able to find from the trip

432
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,959
but on the left this is the one of the

433
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,240
streams

434
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,880
then here like these small things are

435
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,280
the um like uh

436
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,880
metal grid

437
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,919
and then water goes into this metal grid

438
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,679
and disappears in there

439
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,160
so this is metallic just covering this

440
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,119
uh aqueduct and it's going in there

441
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,000
and this water it's only water that

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
comes from here it's a pipe maybe like

443
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
10 centimeters diameter twin i think 10

444
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,760
centimeters diameter and it's all that

445
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,640
allowed to go back into the riverbed

446
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
from this water

447
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,280
on the right side is the one that the uh

448
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,640
like

449
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,799
the rivers are up here and this water is

450
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,679
eighty percent uh then twenty percent

451
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
goes to the aqueduct and this is gray

452
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,520
thin it's um shutter

453
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,240
and it few years ago maybe like two and

454
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,799
a half three years ago it was shot for

455
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
like fully shut so nothing was coming

456
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,919
out

457
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
so this was all dry

458
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,160
the rest of the catchments are like

459
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,880
this one before or like this one they're

460
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
all shut

461
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,840
so if you go back all this water

462
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
is not

463
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
going south

464
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
it's all going on so what people did

465
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
people just turn the water against the

466
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
natural floor

467
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,039
all of this water

468
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
it means that there is no life

469
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,160
uh

470
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,480
moving through this um

471
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,799
highway like water highway for life not

472
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,760
not peace like or fish or any other like

473
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,799
uh

474
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,919
this type of things no seeds

475
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
nothing so this is dry dead um riverbeds

476
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
and when you look at this

477
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,679
it's a catastrophe and this water means

478
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,880
uh not going south means that there is

479
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,480
no this all forests uh feel like fields

480
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
postures

481
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
all of it

482
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,240
is not uh getting this water it was

483
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
getting for

484
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,480
i know from the beginning when this all

485
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
happened the this uh territory like this

486
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
mountain this waters from the beginning

487
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
of this

488
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,240
nature and um

489
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,760
the uh the people who uh like farmers

490
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
they

491
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
say that they when there's a drought

492
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,919
they suffer because there's just not

493
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,280
enough water on the ground to feed

494
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,600
all the plants because it just and but

495
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,960
it's in there

496
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
melting from the eyes but it's not

497
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,400
getting one there

498
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,360
so why i'm telling you this story

499
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
because

500
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,000
uh the

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,640
when the in

502
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,039
90's i think it was it was two thousands

503
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,080
uh crown decided to give back uh some of

504
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,360
the land to marie eva's so now evie own

505
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,600
this water so um land so not irani now

506
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,919
they're a legal owners of this land so

507
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,080
they uh filed a case to environment

508
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,520
court to open this um

509
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
catchment and just to get this water

510
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
back

511
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
but the power company uh fought back and

512
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
there was a lot of going through the

513
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
different appellate uh appeals appeal

514
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
court for many years a lot of money a

515
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
very big media campaign um

516
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
painting uh eevee as an evil and greedy

517
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
and all the stuff

518
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
and at some point they

519
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
thought no we can't do this anymore this

520
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
way

521
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,840
we will

522
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,480
need will need a different approach

523
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
so they

524
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,559
found a way to send a message to this

525
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
about company board

526
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,600
and they invited them

527
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,799
here to show this and they invited them

528
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,640
they talked them about the mountain

529
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
about the river about the forest about

530
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
their role at place and uh all the

531
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
evie's around just people's lives

532
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
and

533
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
it changed

534
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
this company

535
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,520
people who were making decisions mindset

536
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,919
this they saw this they

537
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
changed their vision of this problem and

538
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,840
then when the ice broke and they there's

539
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,400
a process ongoing and the outcome of

540
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,360
this process is this uh shutter that

541
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
gray one was open for eighty percent and

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
only twenty percent go into this

543
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,919
catchment this one i hope now it's

544
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
better because they just deciding how

545
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
much percentage will go into the

546
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
aqueduct how much will go into the river

547
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,960
and also opening it and they hope that

548
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
this like little by little they will

549
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
open almost all the catchments at least

550
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,320
to have some water in there to provide

551
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,120
this

552
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,000
transport for life

553
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,240
so

554
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
after i learned about the story i just

555
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,520
thought um it's so much

556
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
it reminded me of conflicts we have

557
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,440
in

558
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
our area

559
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,240
and it reminded me of a story my friend

560
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
told me she works in a bank

561
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
and she is like

562
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
not an id

563
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
she uses office 365 and she told me a

564
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
story oh the security people they're so

565
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,200
evil

566
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,880
i created a workflow in office 365 and

567
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,919
uh

568
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,039
i really need it because it helps me to

569
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,280
just automate my jobs and it's very

570
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,840
simple workflow but i can't use it

571
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,320
because uh i'm not allowed just to use

572
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
it i need the approval i need a test or

573
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
something i understand what i need they

574
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,679
came back to me they're not answering

575
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,840
messages it's been two months already

576
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,679
this is terrible

577
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,159
security is terrible it's a simple thing

578
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,559
i need to do right there not me

579
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,559
you've been all been through these talks

580
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,880
i'm sure you've heard it

581
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
and when i heard this i thought but it's

582
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
what

583
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200
we like it's the same problem there is a

584
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
conflict uh because people are just

585
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
in different worlds they've got

586
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,840
different

587
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
like mindsets

588
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
and uh how do we like um

589
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
what this eevee used in this situation

590
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,159
this conflict that helped them

591
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,840
to uh get out of the stale situation and

592
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
create some progress not just to change

593
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
everything

594
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
in one day and again what i'm going to

595
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,159
talk here it's not a silver bullet

596
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
it's really just the

597
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
one catchment at the time

598
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,120
uh

599
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,320
and i talked to the evie chief and then

600
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,440
i talked to people around it and uh just

601
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,960
uh other maori people

602
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,240
just started ask asking them questions

603
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
about like this vision

604
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
conflict solving and changing people's

605
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
mindsets

606
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,960
and then i came up with um

607
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,360
three ideas it's not just a full list

608
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
that can be done but for me it was

609
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,039
easier to grasp the three to start to

610
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,120
implementing them to use them and they

611
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,360
were asked her

612
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,279
kayako

613
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,320
storytelling and map is not a territory

614
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,799
and we just like walk through them one

615
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,000
by one and see how what that means and

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,960
what

617
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,840
how they can be applied

618
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,039
who

619
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
uh kayako means if you look at the

620
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,159
dictionary it will just tell you teacher

621
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,600
but it's not

622
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,039
correct translation kai means food and

623
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
it can be just not

624
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
for like

625
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,840
what you eat

626
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,080
but any feed

627
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
uh and ako means teaching or

628
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
knowledge and then here it's the proper

629
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,159
translation to english would be

630
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,039
knowledge feeder

631
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,760
but uh

632
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
it's knowledge feeder it's not the same

633
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,559
as teacher

634
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,240
we used to this uh classical

635
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
teaching setup when there is an expert

636
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,760
and authority that tells you some truth

637
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,919
they tell you something you need to you

638
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,679
just from the start you have to believe

639
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,799
it accept it learn it and then you'll be

640
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,559
tested for it

641
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,760
uh and it comes from like everywhere

642
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
everything every teaching

643
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
right now is

644
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,279
one way so there is a source of

645
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,320
knowledge

646
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,279
that if you decide to learn it you

647
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,320
accepted that it's a source of truth and

648
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,200
something you just need to learn

649
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,640
luckily this changing in

650
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,159
modern education system my kids are

651
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,880
11 and 15 years old when they go to new

652
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
zealand school and new zealand school is

653
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,799
very very changing

654
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,840
and

655
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,679
i think maori culture and this kayak or

656
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,480
ideas also

657
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
influence

658
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,400
it

659
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,960
and the idea is that the teacher is not

660
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,039
someone who tells you the truth

661
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,440
teacher is a person like kayak or the

662
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
person who gives you some knowledge feed

663
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,559
you like food for thought

664
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,120
and you absorb it and um

665
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,520
learn by just this is just a feat it

666
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,960
doesn't have to be like true it's

667
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
something it's just food and then you

668
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,279
need to digest it you need to grow it

669
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,400
you need to

670
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
make something from it but most

671
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,120
important aspect of kayaking is it's a

672
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,640
two-way process

673
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,799
the person who is teaching

674
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,640
is learning

675
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,720
from the person they're teaching

676
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
at the same time so there is no teaching

677
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,919
student they're just two people who feed

678
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
each other knowledge

679
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
you can be in a position of kayako uh it

680
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,320
means that you're not just saying

681
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
something to someone and test them it

682
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,320
means you provide them food and then you

683
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,080
get this food from them

684
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,000
so always constant feedback loop so how

685
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,480
it can be used

686
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
uh in

687
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,559
security

688
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,480
uh this is the very nice

689
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,760
picture found at zero website and

690
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
this is like classical stuff but on the

691
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
left like shifting left paradigm is

692
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,399
that gets security

693
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,399
before everything's deployed and now we

694
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,720
just push it to pen testing even

695
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,799
internal testing security testing or

696
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,919
whatever

697
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,840
and this is nice words secure coding

698
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,600
practice say threat modeling

699
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
always like sex threatening workshops

700
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,919
programs education

701
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
but the kayak apart and this what i've

702
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,480
been doing in our company is that

703
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
uh

704
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,880
i'm as a security person

705
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,919
involved in the product design from the

706
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
beginning so not in the building stage

707
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,200
from the beginning they've got an idea

708
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
they got some business ideas they start

709
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,799
documenting it and i'm invited or to

710
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,360
just to observe from the beginning

711
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,840
uh and then to raise any questions if

712
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,919
they are like how uh

713
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,559
this idea what implications it got how

714
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,960
it can be secured and all the stuff

715
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,000
then when they are the building stage uh

716
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,440
i

717
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
uh like there's a team that worked on

718
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
this product they just started building

719
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,480
it i'm there at every stand up i'm there

720
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,279
at every uh pull request

721
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,159
and

722
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,120
uh it means that i can see uh we use

723
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,200
only infrastructures code uh all the

724
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
templates confirmation way in aws uh it

725
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,520
means that then when they create

726
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,880
resources in the template i review them

727
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,840
if uh the they've got policies not using

728
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
default those policies other policies

729
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,919
correct or tight enough for

730
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,559
all the stuff and it's done as a code

731
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,080
review

732
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
not at the out audit at the end

733
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,799
and uh threat modeling that's what we

734
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
are planning just i think in a couple of

735
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,678
weeks we're having this um

736
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,360
threat modeling uh exercises

737
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,320
and then uh what i want to do uh we've

738
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,559
tried it already but uh

739
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,960
that team was reformed now it's a new

740
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,000
team so two embed threat model questions

741
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
in the story template

742
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,880
and it's not just put it in there it be

743
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,360
there for them to help them to

744
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,039
use it properly

745
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,200
on another hand when i'm there and the

746
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,440
stand ups at retros

747
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,240
at

748
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,320
pull request code reviews

749
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
i hear them

750
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,240
i hear their complaints i hear how their

751
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,200
struggles and i hear their ideas

752
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
i see how they use um guardrails or

753
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,399
limitations borders i put for them

754
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,039
and uh it means that sometimes it says

755
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,559
configured not

756
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
user-friendly yes it's doing a job but

757
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,960
the

758
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,919
because they need to uh

759
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,799
so the the how the how much the labor to

760
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,799
be able to implement it is so much

761
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
higher then it reduces the value of the

762
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,559
security control

763
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
but it still needs to be

764
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,440
there

765
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
and that's why when i hear what exactly

766
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,159
the problem is oh yeah it's because it's

767
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,799
not for example we have to enter this

768
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
key and the session all the time you use

769
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
it there is no remember function or

770
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
something like this

771
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,559
or number of hours is too short for this

772
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,720
environment you doesn't it doesn't have

773
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,440
to be one hour um

774
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,080
session key expiry it can be 12 hours or

775
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,240
8 hours for the working day because it's

776
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,799
not production and staging

777
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
how do you know

778
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,440
about this how do you hear about this

779
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
just by being there and that's like i'm

780
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,159
there for them to give them knowledge

781
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,039
when they need it and i'm here to learn

782
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
from them how they use it and what

783
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,200
problem they have so this is this kayak

784
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,799
concept

785
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,919
i know you are another one is a pair

786
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,279
programming

787
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,320
and uh

788
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,360
and the keywords you can use in there is

789
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,760
uh champions

790
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,559
uh i know that the main question from

791
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,159
people will be how do you scale it and a

792
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,600
huge organization you just can't be

793
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
there

794
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,799
that's where the champions come in and

795
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,679
there's one talk later

796
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,159
to one talk tomorrow yep i think

797
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,559
tomorrow about the uh security champions

798
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,200
it's a non well-known idea already but

799
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
now you can look at it from a different

800
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,000
angle so not just champions doing things

801
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,399
but these champions also also can grow

802
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,440
into

803
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,600
mentos into kayakers that are not just

804
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,840
leading the way but also

805
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,399
be being kayak or change

806
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
mindsets around them

807
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,519
um

808
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,840
yep and mentorship is a skill it's

809
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,159
something to look into these people and

810
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,600
when the champions your potential

811
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,720
champions

812
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
and uh especially when you hire for

813
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,679
security positions it's another skill

814
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,440
that i think very valuable when you look

815
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,039
at the person not only just certificates

816
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
and the experience knowledge but also

817
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,760
can they be a good mentor to anyone can

818
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,720
they be a good teacher but not kayak or

819
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,320
can they share it can they listen

820
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,000
uh next one is

821
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,919
telling a story so we had who kayoko

822
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,880
doing what telling a story so how these

823
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,279
kayakers can uh

824
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,799
change this

825
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,840
um

826
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,159
mindset what should they do and it's not

827
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,399
only our traditional uh

828
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
type of deliverance knowledge

829
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,519
do you remember the mindset stuff i told

830
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,919
you at the beginning all these chat sets

831
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,480
and quotes uh stuff

832
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,559
i doubt but i'm sure you remember the

833
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,559
story i told you about this conflicts

834
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,320
because it's a story

835
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
it's a fairy tale and a fairy tale it's

836
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,360
a very simple um plot

837
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,000
uh you can remember and you can retell

838
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,919
and there is something you can connect

839
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:40,720
to

840
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,440
and there is something you can uh like

841
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,480
learn and use some moral from it

842
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,399
uh

843
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,440
we

844
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,559
fairy tales were not fairy tales before

845
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
all this scientific revolution and

846
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,559
enlightenment era

847
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,480
they were stories

848
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,000
they were part

849
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,440
they were main

850
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
way of education

851
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,159
but with time we still have stories

852
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,280
but

853
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,359
and they still educate question is what

854
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,879
they educate us

855
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,760
like

856
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
what knowledge they bring

857
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
and uh

858
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,560
there is some stuff uh you can look at

859
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,520
this message they send um

860
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
i'm not saying it's better good there's

861
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,000
some good in there that teaches you some

862
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,679
good qualities maybe in life i don't

863
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,480
know

864
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
uh but in

865
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
other side of the world like scientific

866
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,159
science serious adult

867
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,639
uh business we are not telling stories

868
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,879
anymore because we're saying oh this is

869
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,879
childish this is something we should

870
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,040
like it's it's for kids or it's for

871
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,199
entertainment so it it stopped being for

872
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
kids only right now it was on the focus

873
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,639
but now it's entertainment all this

874
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,679
hollywood and uh comics world and all

875
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
this stuff

876
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
but

877
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,320
stories

878
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
uh is a very very powerful

879
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,720
tool of um

880
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,560
delivering information

881
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
and so what are just what i've been

882
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,040
doing

883
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,920
in this company i was uh

884
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
translating

885
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
bringing

886
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,119
what i read

887
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,560
to the space in the company to

888
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,240
create this like

889
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,280
some

890
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,720
context with stories

891

897
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,400
he started uh last week in aws security

898
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,920
flavored

899
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,200
newsletter

900

regularly and it's very very useful if

901
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
you're in aws highly recommend

902
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
uh and

903
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,879
i read this news and then i um just

904
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,680
retell them in our slack channel

905
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
in a general channel if it's just on

906
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,440
general security and passwords or

907
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,599
something like this for employees or in

908
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,760
our engineering channel if it's a little

909
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
bit more taking

910
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
and i found out that this and

911
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,119
and what's important i do it regularly

912
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
and so i tell these stories i make this

913
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,800
feel like

914
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
becoming a norm something that happens

915
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,760
regularly that's something that exists

916
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,000
and uh with employees there was a very

917
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,960
very interesting city like some outcome

918
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,520
once uh i posted a story about scheming

919
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,640
uh and how people just fall into these

920
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,040
traps help get scammed

921
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,920
and one of the employees uh answered

922
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,640
like

923
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,480
started a thread in there

924
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,040
how he was scammed some time ago

925
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,440
like lo or have he lost a few thousand

926
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,000
of dollars how he felt it was a really

927
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,560
really sensitive coming out thing

928
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,880
and uh

929
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,240
but because there was space created to

930
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,079
make it um

931
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,119
or not something sudden but uh

932
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,480
appropriate

933
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,640
and safe

934
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,040
he was able to share it

935
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,599
and people started to add to it and

936
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,520
discussing it and it became something

937
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,440
real and it just that was very very

938
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
amazing

939
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,800
feeling of this like uh fireplace story

940
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
uh and uh for engineers they always like

941
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
uh raid the question and once i saw that

942
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
was some talk i plucked the idea news i

943
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,520
posted some time ago and then maybe

944
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,920
three or four weeks later in the pull

945
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
request and some called people just made

946
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,960
changes oh now i thought about it

947
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,200
because it could be this threat this and

948
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
this

949
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,079
and then i remembered oh my gosh but

950
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,400
this is connected to the new new news i

951
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
posted some time ago

952
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,720
or another story that um it's not only

953
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,960
news when we go to

954
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,440
round tables conferences it's not only

955
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,079
schematical slides like this is this

956
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,720
this this this is not only teaching it's

957
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,240
also telling stories sharing experiences

958
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,960
and

959
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,440
learnings and in such a way that can be

960
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,720
retold

961
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,599
and reused and i went to a security

962
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,200
round table at one point and there was

963
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,640
an amazing story about um phishing email

964
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
and then how facebook was blocked

965
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,119
and

966
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,359
why it happened and we had the same

967
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,400
setup in our company and i just posted

968
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,480
how this is um

969
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,200
this story and then i go oh yeah we need

970
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,160
to change it so it was accepted

971
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,200
uh that we need by people not just like

972
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
something directive and some order or

973
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,160
something you want to

974
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,720
enforce on them

975
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,960
but something like it's a story i can

976
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
connect to it do i see something around

977
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,400
me that

978
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,880
i can like apply it to yes and then

979
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,640
there is no defensive

980
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,200
feelings in this person and then they if

981
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,920
uh the more they repeat this kind of

982
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,200
things the

983
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,119
more it becomes a part of their everyday

984
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,599
life context the more their mindset has

985
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,440
changed

986
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
and the third one is who kayak or what

987
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
telling the story when or where on the

988
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,680
territory so what this conflict was uh

989
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,720
um

990
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
like really like

991
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
one of the things that saw this conflict

992
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,720
was not just going to the court of the

993
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,040
real one conflict not just going to the

994
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,720
court and discussing it um using papers

995
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,560
but bringing these people

996
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,640
to this place and showing them and

997
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,480
talking about this telling the story

998
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
there at the river not in the courtroom

999
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,200
so what

1000
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,000
uh

1001
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,640
map is not a territory i'm sure some of

1002
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,560
you heard about this this is a new not

1003
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,839
new concept

1004
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,880
uh there's some uh a lot of um

1005
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
interesting frameworks and ideas came

1006
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,960
out of it already but what does it mean

1007
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
so what is a map

1008
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,480
map is not only a map like on the left

1009
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,280
side um

1010
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
this is the map of this area

1011
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,319
but anything that is not this place is

1012
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,599
also a map so this picture is a map me

1013
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,640
talking about this era is a map you can

1014
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,319
imagine it and this one is also a map

1015
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,119
yeah this is the river in new zealand

1016
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,040
it's amazingly

1017
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,960
not cold when you touch it

1018
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
yeah

1019
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,720
and this river is very chocolatey

1020
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,118
i really like special

1021
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,760
and uh so

1022
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,359
this is uh

1023
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,599
everything that's not real

1024
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,520
situation or place is a map

1025
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,400
how we can apply it to security one like

1026
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,119
security situation because what would

1027
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,560
be not

1028
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
not a map

1029
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,960
capture the flag hackathons at the end

1030
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,560
of the code uh they are all good because

1031
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
they move us like from okay day-to-day

1032
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
job there's no attacks there's no

1033
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,319
problems there is no uh

1034
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,760
um

1035
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,079
situations you can like uh get

1036
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,560
adrenaline in you so we create this

1037
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,000
spaces that people can uh not normal for

1038
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,480
compared to day-to-day job but something

1039
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,839
but it's still

1040
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,720
a map compared to what you produce what

1041
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,040
you do in

1042
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,599
your day-to-day work

1043
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,359
but still good so this is better than

1044
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,160
nothing and and good things yeah but

1045
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
they're still maps

1046
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,279
ranges

1047
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,119
it's very aggressive picture i don't

1048
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,880
like it but uh i couldn't find any

1049
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,720
peaceful pictures of

1050
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
ranges

1051
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,119
yeah so uh

1052
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,920
uh i went through i i tried one of them

1053
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,440
was i don't remember the name some

1054
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,200
company that they provide ranges and

1055
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
ranges like the security ranges is not

1056
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,040
um again not a new concept the idea is

1057
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
that there's some product environment

1058
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,920
created it's got vulnerabilities from

1059
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,720
the beginning and you go in there

1060
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,960
and your job is just like a task

1061
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,760
challenge to find all of them to hack it

1062
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,880
and uh that's how you learn this ahem

1063
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,079
mindset

1064
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,520
uh the uh like enemy

1065
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,680
what mindset to be able to build

1066
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,480
defenses against it so i took one of

1067
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,839
this um

1068
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,079
thank you of wasp to provide in a free

1069
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,440
um offer

1070
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
by the way you can find it i think os

1071
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,240
provides it

1072
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,680
and as i'm a wasp member uh i i use this

1073
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,560
opportunity and for one month we did

1074
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
this there was a website and we did this

1075
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,960
um like hacking and you were getting

1076
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,319
points for finding all these

1077
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,920
vulnerabilities

1078
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,200
uh and

1079
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,560
it was totally uh it was familiar but

1080
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
totally

1081
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,599
not relevant no tech stack for me at all

1082
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,400
just

1083
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,280
nothing and uh i would say i

1084
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,680
never used this tech stack in my career

1085
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,800
because for me it was a little bit

1086
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
outdated

1087
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
um so um

1088
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,000
but

1089
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,839
anyway it was

1090
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,800
amazing how it changed your thinking

1091
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
and then how you start thinking in a

1092
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,119
breakup way

1093
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,720
and i think it's

1094
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,599
you need this feeling when you are in a

1095
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,400
threat modeling mode and i really want

1096
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,800
to think look at your thing what you're

1097
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,359
building from the um

1098
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,920
breaker point of view this is cool but

1099
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
then this was the problem with that it

1100
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,720
was not relevant uh to what we are doing

1101
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
so when you've got your developers and

1102
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,200
you send them to this range you buy this

1103
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,680
access for for them to learn

1104
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,119
how do you find one that will fit

1105
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,960
the text tag they're using right now the

1106
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,359
job because one you do this xml attack

1107
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,240
or something in the

1108
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,359
apache

1109
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,640
server

1110
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,839
but you are in aws cloud serverless and

1111
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,520
uh using a react um

1112
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,319
single page application

1113
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,560
totally different it's still vulnerable

1114
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,440
but with different vulnerabilities

1115
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,280
and then i started to look are there

1116
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
other ways so there's things that

1117
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,839
people that this is their business they

1118
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,480
provide it uh as the the business um but

1119
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,040
what i was maybe i don't

1120
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,119
i couldn't find it if you know such a

1121
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839
resource send me or if you want to build

1122
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,920
such a thing i would love to

1123
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,839
join and do it together

1124
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,880
something kind of legos thing for cloud

1125
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,119
uh and for any like for every major

1126
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,319
cloud uh you just uh it's um templates

1127
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,359
and you

1128
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,440
combine these templates

1129
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,280
uh to create uh and with known

1130
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,680
vulnerabilities so i've got s3s okay

1131
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,040
you've got there's a template for three

1132
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,319
vulnerabilities i've got uh inst2 and

1133
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,040
vpc okay this is the template how to set

1134
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,960
up a vpc and easy to visit

1135
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,119
vulnerabilities so you just combine this

1136
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,440
looking as close as your product and

1137
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,760
then you deploy it in an account and get

1138
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,160
the developers in and tell them

1139
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,319
can you find all of it so something like

1140
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,200
this but again it's not as clo like it's

1141
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,480
closer

1142
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,079
uh but also or what i like uh i'm doing

1143
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,319
i when i see

1144
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,160
something in our code

1145
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,240
like oh i seen the news this was hacked

1146
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,079
and this is what we use

1147
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,920
i always try to

1148
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,240
point look at this this is the same

1149
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,760
thing that wasn't the newest that we are

1150
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,400
using it here or trying to

1151
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,280
create these connections between uh

1152
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,079
vulnerabilities that are reported

1153
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,560
somewhere on some website with our code

1154
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,319
and pointing finger to it

1155
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,480
uh for the employees it's very cool you

1156
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,240
can just like uh

1157
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,520
create a few um write uh some code and

1158
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,160
uh upload it in a few for memory sticks

1159
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,920
and just throw away in the office and

1160
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,000
see who will be the first to put us into

1161
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
their machine right

1162
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,280
it's kind of fun

1163
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,520
uh now i need to implement it before

1164
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,359
they watch this talk my colleagues

1165
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,440
ah

1166
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
so

1167
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,920
the

1168
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,000
again this is not a silver bullet this

1169
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,160
is not like okay we will do this now

1170
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,720
only this is not discarding all of the

1171
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
things we're doing with traditional

1172
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,960
education certification all the stuff

1173
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,280
this is just an extra

1174
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,640
facet in this multi-facet

1175
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,440
thing that i hope now we'll be able to

1176
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,400
use and see things with extra filter

1177
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,920
extra layer

1178
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,760
and uh to use this uh who uh what when

1179
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,880
like kayak italian story uh on the

1180
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,160
territory

1181
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,599
so i think uh for me the lesson like the

1182
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,880
idea i'm leaving with and trying to like

1183
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
that guides my

1184
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,880
um things i'm doing in my company is

1185
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,560
just be there tell the story make it

1186
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,760
feel real

1187
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
and i understand there's a scaling

1188
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,680
problem for

1189
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,960
big enterprises but uh

1190
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,880
i think it's all solvable if you start

1191
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,400
thinking uh as this like distribute this

1192
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
of this thing is not at the central

1193
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,559
monolith but as a distributed system how

1194
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,480
it can distribute the be there tell the

1195
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,240
story make it feel real and i think it's

1196
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,319
also possible to apply it

1197
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,559
to big companies um

1198
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,000
that's me

1199
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,440
thank you very much questions
