2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,520
well thank you andrew for the wonderful

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,000
welcome it's so exciting to be here with

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,920
you virtually

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,200
and today we're going to talk about a

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,120
topic that's very dear to me which is we

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,359
deserve rights so let's first i want to

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,520
cover one quick thing with you which is

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
that this talk is completely dedicated

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,519
to all the hackers who's ever been

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
scared to disclose i know some of you

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
are probably joining and you may have

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,320
been one of those folks and to all the

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,960
hackers who have been persecuted for

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
trying to do something good or just

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,760
actually doing their job surprisingly

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,440
and to all the people who are in the

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
fight to bring rights for hackers and

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
for you for coming to this talk because

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,520
even though we're in security

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,399
we really need to discuss about policies

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,800
such as federal policies and how much of

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
an impact they have but also

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,039
it's about time we have some sort of

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
protections because at this time we

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
still have zero protections when we

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,719
disclose vulnerabilities

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,680
so this talk is going to dive into that

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
um but my name is chloe mistaki i am a

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
strategy consultant and researcher i'm

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,159
also the advisor for hacking is not a

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,720
crime i also co-founded it i'm also the

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
co-founder of we open tech

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,600
which is an organization that helps to

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
empower

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,880
and provide a community for marginalized

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,439
genders so you gotta have gender

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,759
equality and equity and this is what we

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,040
try to do

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,240
um also itsp magazine for the change

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
making podcast

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
and also i'm a vice columnist for

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
security boulevard so if there's

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,799
anything that you want to know about

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,880

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,119
love that um that is my url so

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,119
standoutintech.com

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,640
but let's get into the real reason why

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,759
you're here

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
so i mentioned a little bit earlier that

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
i co-founded a organization called

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
hacking is not a crime

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
and what we do is basically it's a

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
grassroot

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,400
movement

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
you may have seen this on twitter next

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
to certain people's profiles um

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
hacking is not a crime or we also call

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,640
ourselves high knack but basically what

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
we're trying to do as a community as a

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,480
whole is to come together and try to

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
make a difference by challenging the

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,959
public perceptions of the hackers

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
because in reality

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
that's what this talk is going to be

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
talking about is

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
what can we do to finally get rights and

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
protections and until we change public

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
perception we have absolutely

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,959
no future on getting protections

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,239
so if you want to get involved in

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,599
hacking is not a crime or learn more

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
about it just feel free to go hacking is

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,400
not a crime.org

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,519
but

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,360
for those that are

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
probably getting a little bit strange

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
the fact that i'm talking about hackers

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
getting rights for hackers you may be

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
associating the term hackers with

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
attackers

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
and i just want to be very specific here

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
that there's two different parties

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,120
in our community we have those that are

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
hackers um also known as security

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
researchers and then we have attackers

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
or criminals or cyber criminals or

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
malicious actors and basically the

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
difference between the two

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,080
is that the intent

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
so they use the same set of skills to

101
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,159
find vulnerabilities but the difference

102
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
is is that one's going to report that

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
vulnerability the other one is never

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
going to report that vulnerability

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,159
instead they're going to use it for

106
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,319
their own gains

107
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
so there's a huge difference so if i say

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
hacker it does mean security researcher

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
when i use the term attacker it doesn't

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
mean hackers it means those that are

111
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,040
involved in criminal activities

112
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,920
and i think it's first now we can go

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
into the real situation that we're in

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,519
which is the current landscape for

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,560
hackers

116
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
right now we don't have any rights so

117
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
just i should let everyone know i had a

118
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
time the reason this talk is around is

119
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
because we have absolutely no rights nor

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
protections

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,320
and even when we're reporting things um

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
you know vulnerabilities to

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
organizations

124
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
sometimes we're either ignored or

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
sometimes we have to worry about legal

126
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,320
issues just in this case for example

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,840
um you may have been familiar with

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
kevin's case which basically

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,720
is about reporting a bug to dji which

130
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
you probably know as the drone

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
manufacturer

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
well the back story here is that dji uh

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
created their own bug bounty program and

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,080
what do i mean by that that means that

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,160
they didn't partner with like hacker one

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,479
or bug crowd

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
they basically decided to do their own

138
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,320
and it's a lot of work to do a bug

139
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
bounty program on your own because it

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,199
takes

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,960
you know more than one person to manage

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,479
it and to keep tabs of the bikes that

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,919
are reported making sure they're being

144
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,400
patched having conversations with the

145
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
hacker who basically disclosed the

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
vulnerabilities and making sure people

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
stay in scope it's a lot of work but dji

148
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
decided they want to do it on their own

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,039
at that time and they just launched it

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
so kevin and his friend sean basically

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
came across their bug bounty program

152
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,960
and they sent an email wanting to just

153
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
confirm what was in scope

154
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
and it took them two weeks to respond

155
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
this is a red flag right there once

156
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,280
again it lets you know that they may be

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
taking a little bit too much at one time

158
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
when first starting

159
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
and so kevin basically found a

160
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
vulnerability after gaining the two

161
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
weeks of confirmation

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,240
and he reports this vulnerability and

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
they offered him 30k

164
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
and this is great right kevin's like i

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
got 30k for this bug however to receive

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,759
those funds you would have to sign a

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,120
contract

168
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
and this contract didn't offer any

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
protections

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
for him

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
so instead he responded saying i don't

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
want the funds it's okay

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,000
and he thought that would be it

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
however internally dji was panicking

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
they were thinking that this could

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
become a big pr situation

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
and they saw him as a threat

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,400
so then what they did was that they sent

179
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
him a letter

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
which is what you see on this screen i

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
know you can't probably read it but you

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,319
can go to his blog post and find it

183
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
but the letter itself basically said

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
that he went out of scope even though he

185
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,919
did

186
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,000
stay within scope based on the email

187
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
that he sent confirming the scope that

188
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,160
took two weeks to do

189
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,639
and the unfortunate bit was that because

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,800
they claimed that he was out of scope

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
that he basically broke the cfa the

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
computer fraud and abuse act

193
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
and this is a really scary situation to

194
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,400
be you know attacked under the cern type

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,759
of legislation and so kevin basically

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,120
the good news

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,599
was that kevin was like well

198
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
this is uh this is a complete nightmare

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
publish every single communication i've

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,560
ever had with dji

202
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
and that's it and i'm going to walk away

203
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,280
and when he did

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
there even included internal

205
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
conversations that they didn't know that

206
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,000
he

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,960
had eyes on they didn't they didn't see

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
that within the chain there was

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,759
discussions internally of labeling him

210
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,400
as a pr threat

211
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
anyway as you can possibly imagine

212
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,360
damage was definitely done um because

213
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
when he posted it dj had gotten some

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,280
pretty heavy dark waters afterwards by

215
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
the press and they they decided to not

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
pursue uh going after him anymore with

217
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
legal action

218
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
so

219
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,039
with kevin's case it's one of those

220
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,039
things that's a reminder for us to

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
acknowledge that even though you have

222
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
bug bounty programs and vulnerability

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
disclosure policies even when someone

224
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
reports they're still afraid to report

225
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,479
because you know companies have been

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,000
using it to attack researchers and we've

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,360
seen this over and over and over again

228
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,280
in the community

229
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
and this is the problem that we face

230
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
that at this time one out of four

231
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
researchers will disclose a

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,880
vulnerability

233
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
and the reason for that is it's either

234
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
ignored when they report it

235
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,880
or they get thrown with a lawsuit

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
which that we saw that happened in the

237
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,320
case of kevin

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
so how do we fix this how do we get

239
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
protections and rights so then people

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
like kevin would be protected from even

241
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
a legal action targeting him when he was

242
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
in the right

243
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
and the reality is that we have to

244
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,160
influence the public because the public

245
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,959
plays a huge part in anything that

246
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,600
happens in our country or anywhere

247
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
around the world the public influences

248
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
decisions and can influence change

249
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,399
it can also create movements as well

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
and to be able to influence the public

251
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
cycle you have to work with the media

252
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
which is you know social media and the

253
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,120
press

254
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
awesome marketing

255
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
you also have to work with organizations

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
that have to make sure they have

257
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
voluntarily disclosure policies and also

258
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
to hold them accountable when they do

259
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
come after one of our researchers in our

260
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,440
community that was trying to disclose

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
something and was either ignored or

262
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,640
threatened

263
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
also we have to update our legislation

264
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
we have legislation that from the 80s

265
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,080
that still

266
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
really makes an impact on us to this day

267
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
and

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,279
before we go into how do we influence

269
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,360
the media organizations and legislation

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
to help us get rights for hackers we

271
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,600
first need to dive into

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
humans

273
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,160
overall how does human behavior work

274
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
because by knowing how a human behavior

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
tends to work out it allows us to

276
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
understand what we need to do to

277
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
influence a change

278
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,959
and you may have heard basically this

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,279
term socially constructed beliefs so

280
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,600
basically socially constructed beliefs

281
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,320
are these ideas that humans have created

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
that are constructed in order to make

283
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
sense of the world that they live in and

284
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
it's very objective

285
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
it's basically what we see in

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
experiences that influence and put

287
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
things into categories it helps us

288
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,920
basically try to figure out who's like

289
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
us who's not like us

290
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
um and also it's a way of seeing things

291
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,279
black and white which is not the way

292
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,120
we're supposed to be seeing things

293
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,519
humans are complex it's very hard to put

294
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,600
people into groups

295
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
it's more like everyone's on some sort

296
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,600
of shade of gray but socially

297
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
constructed beliefs are not always

298
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
accurate

299
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
and that's the huge thing here to take

300
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
away

301
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
so how do socially constructed beliefs

302
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,959
how do they play a role well it's broken

303
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
down in three different parts so we have

304
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
part one which is fear

305
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,160
so

306
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,959
how that works exactly is

307
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,600
say for example when you grew up um

308
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
everything around you

309
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
like in your books anytime you put on

310
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,360
the tv anytime you watched a movie

311
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,959
anytime you heard an adult have a

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,399
conversation

313
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,360
that

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
randomly just using this

315
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
that a person with pink hair is a

316
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
dangerous individual so anytime a book

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
or a movie shows a person with pink hair

318
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
it's always a criminal so every time

319
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,279
that you now see someone pink hair you

320
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,720
think that that person could be a

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
criminal because you've seen it

322
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
everywhere around you even heard adults

323
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
talking about it or teachers talking

324
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
about it indirectly or reading in your

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
book or turn on the news it always seems

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,639
that the person will take care of

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,079
someone dangerous

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,920
and so this is a belief that you bought

329
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
into as a young child and still to this

330
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
day you may still follow it

331
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
and so what happens is in your brain you

332
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
can part of my eyes

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,720
people

334
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,160
you have these socially constructive

335
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,200
beliefs

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
and those could actually stem from who's

337
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
like me who's not like me

338
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,839
and based on that itself there's a part

339
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,600
of your brain called the amygdala which

340
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,160
is your fight versus flight mechanism

341
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
you may have heard of it before it's

342
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,399
like a almond shaped tissue

343
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,839
inside your brain

344
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,320
that is completely subconscious but it's

345
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,399
basically alerting you to let you know

346
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,639
that hey you're in survival mode or if

347
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,399
you're not in survival mode

348
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,079
but it's usually activated when we're

349
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,120
afraid

350
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,079
so

351
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,000
in the example the pink hair is being a

352
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
dangerous individual say for example

353
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
that you're walking down the street and

354
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,839
behind you there's someone with pink

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,959
hair

356
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,680
so

357
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
your amygdala is sending a warning

358
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,519
saying warning warning person with pink

359
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
hair behind you be careful

360
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
it sends

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,079
now a message to the prefrontal cortex

362
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,639
where it verifies the threat and the

363
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,399
prefrontal cortex which is just in the

364
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,839
front part of your brain it works like

365
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
the ceo of your brain basically it uses

366
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
logic and reason to break down the

367
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,839
potential threat being perceived by your

368
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
amygdala that's sending that warning

369
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
that you're maybe in danger so at this

370
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
time

371
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
when that person with pink hair is

372
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,399
behind you the maybelline sent that

373
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
signal to the prefrontal cortex saying

374
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
warning you know personal pink hair

375
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
behind you based on that socially

376
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
constructed belief remember

377
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,720
so now in your brain you're breaking it

378
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
down what you can do so you're thinking

379
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
okay so the person with pink hair

380
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
there's a high chance that person could

381
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
be a criminal so i could either cross

382
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,120
the street i could go into the store or

383
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
i could clutch my bag just a little bit

384
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,279
tighter just to be on the safe side

385
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,160
or

386
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
maybe one more thought comes to mind

387
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,560
which is don't act at all

388
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
and usually you always forget about that

389
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,279
one last bit

390
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
however there is a way how you can

391
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
influence that

392
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,480
so say for example

393
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,199
that you saw a video on youtube and it

394
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,440
was someone with pink hair and all they

395
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
were talking about was that it is a

396
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,560
really hard life to have

397
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,120
because of their hair color based on the

398
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,519
hair color alone that people perceive

399
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,240
them as criminals and so when they walk

400
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
in for a job interview they don't get

401
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,959
that position because people have the

402
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,560
socially constructed belief that has

403
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
been bought by society that people with

404
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
pink hair are dangerous individuals or

405
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,399
the fact that the person with pink hair

406
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,120
is also talking in their vlog

407
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
that it hurts them when they see people

408
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
across the street go into the store or

409
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,959
clutch their bag a little bit tighter

410
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,480
just because they're right behind

411
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
someone

412
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
and say that you're back in that

413
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
situation now you're back in the street

414
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,920
remember you had three

415
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
or four choices to make the first one is

416
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
crossing the street to get away from the

417
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
person with pink hair behind you going

418
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
into stores the second one the third

419
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
option is to clutch your bag a little

420
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
bit tighter

421
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,199
and the last one is to not take action

422
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,440
and suddenly your memory gets jogged a

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
little bit in this one moment and it's

424
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,399
like hey

425
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,000
hold on one sec

426
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,760
by crossing that street clutching your

427
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,600
bag or going to the store you're

428
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
basically going to be possibly hurting

429
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
this person's feelings behind you with

430
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
the pink hair and you saw that youtube

431
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
video and that was really hard for them

432
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
maybe you should take a step back

433
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
and at that moment

434
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,920
you decide

435
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
not to take action

436
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
because the reality is

437
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,120
that socially constructive beliefs can

438
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
always be challenged

439
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
it means that we have to get in

440
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
our uncomfortableness that means we have

441
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
to get outside our bubble to understand

442
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,959
the world how it works and how it

443
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
functions but it's so important that we

444
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,079
question our biases because they play a

445
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,440
huge role

446
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
because also people are seeing us as

447
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
bad individuals because we see it in the

448
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
movies and tv shows in our books

449
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,279
you know we always get these weird

450
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,920
images about the hacker community and

451
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,199
because of that

452
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
people are afraid of us

453
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,000
and they see us as not like them so

454
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
they're always going to think of hackers

455
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
as criminals

456
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,639
but there are ways how you can get

457
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
involved and the first one that you can

458
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,680
do is uh go to hack is not a crime.org

459
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
there is a hacker stories project which

460
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
basically various different people in

461
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,440
the hacker community made a recording of

462
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,519
themselves talking about why they became

463
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,959
a hacker and the issues that they've

464
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,040
been facing since being a hacker and why

465
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
it means so much for them to have

466
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,800
protection and you can also participate

467
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
if you like too you just record a video

468
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
and the instructions are also placed on

469
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,199
our site

470
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,800
because the reality of all this is that

471
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,399
to be able to influence the public

472
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,360
perception of hackers we have to work

473
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
together as a community to challenge

474
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,120
those public perceptions

475
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
because right now as we have learned is

476
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,280
that socially constructed beliefs stem

477
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
from the media

478
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
like in our movies our books our news

479
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,599
our social media and marketing

480
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,760
because it's through images

481
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
images like these that if you were to

482
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
type an ethical hacker or even criminal

483
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,079
hacker you would get the exact same

484
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
image that dark hoodie figure sometimes

485
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
with the ski mask

486
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,400
and that's not what we look like at all

487
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
and that's the most annoying part

488
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
but it's these images that are holding

489
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
us back from having rights and

490
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
protections because it's feeding into

491
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
the socially constructed belief that

492
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
hackers are dangerous individuals

493
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,960
but also the terms that are being used

494
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,520
because still to this day a lot of the

495
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
press still reports

496
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
hackers as criminals

497
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
you know using the term hackers when

498
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
they should be using the term attackers

499
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,640
or criminals

500
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
and the language does play a huge role

501
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,919
because of that

502
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,840
and it really does hurt when the media

503
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,039
doesn't know the difference between a

504
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,640
hacker and attacker

505
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,039
and they really they don't know better

506
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,200
because they haven't been told most

507
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,919
likely or they haven't been corrected

508
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,440
so they're just trying to do their job

509
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
so it's best for us to also acknowledge

510
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
that this is the situation

511
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
because we're getting these things for

512
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
example hackers can turn your home

513
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
computer into a bomb

514
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
that is not what a hacker would do

515
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
that's what an attacker would do or

516
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,840
hackers post pornography in a in a

517
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
virtual classroom

518
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
do you think a hacker anyone from the

519
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
hacker community would do that no

520
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
that's someone who has something for

521
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
their own gain

522
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,520
it's an intent remember

523
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
or a hacker threatening to leak patients

524
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,840
therapy notes we already know

525
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
they don't want to do that either

526
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
because we understand that's

527
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
confidential we stay within scope

528
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,960
so what we have to do is correct them

529
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
nicely so that means when we talk to the

530
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
press is to

531
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
remind them that there's two separate

532
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,039
parties this is going to help us quite a

533
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,840
bit

534
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,559
and you can do this very easy

535
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
one is always remember to be kind

536
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
because nothing will ever happen or

537
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
nothing is ever going to change if we

538
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,799
aren't kind to one another

539
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,559
the last thing you want to do is start

540
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,280
an argument with someone from the press

541
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
that's never going to bridge a

542
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,360
conversation that's just going to cause

543
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
a situation

544
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,799
but you can always dm or comment

545
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
publicly just always remember to be nice

546
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
okay they don't know better have empathy

547
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,679
and you can you could do this by calling

548
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,720
out on twitter uh we've had people do

549
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
that and remember

550
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
the reasons why um you can also feel

551
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
free to tag uh hacknotcrime on twitter

552
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
uh because a lot of our

553
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
are basically we have these advocates

554
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
they will also step in to help the

555
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,720
conversation

556
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,520
also you can do it with marketing a lot

557
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
of times in information security or

558
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
cyber security companies they will

559
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,679
basically use the image of the hooded

560
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,640
figure i use the terms hackers instead

561
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
of attackers and this is one of those

562
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
things that we need to definitely fix so

563
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,440
you can also do that as well

564
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
you can also give them kudos when they

565
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
get it right because that does mean

566
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,559
quite a bit

567
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
and one of my favorites is sending a

568
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
letter to the copy desk so this is one

569
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,799
that we sent to the new york times

570
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,760
but basically this allows for

571
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,919
the editorial team to make sure that the

572
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,480
reporters are using the right language

573
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
so always send a letter to a copy desk

574
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
letting them know hey one of the things

575
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
that you featured

576
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
had this problem use the wrong terms and

577
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,720
i just want to share with you why this

578
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
matters to get it correctly

579
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
also if you are someone who does talk to

580
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
the press here and there make sure that

581
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,840
you always let that reporter know

582
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
that when you say the term hacker you

583
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
mean security researchers and when you

584
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,280
use the term attacker that means the

585
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,440
person who's the criminal and that

586
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,200
hackers and attackers are two separate

587
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
parties so anytime you do comment to the

588
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,159
press you want to remind them

589
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,280
to make sure they use the correct

590
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,520
terminology

591
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,600
and also if you're doing anything on

592
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
video or anything like it please don't

593
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
wear a hoodie on a camera and the reason

594
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,520
for that is because we have to challenge

595
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
those images that are all over google so

596
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
if you were a hoodie on camera you're

597
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
just feeding into the situation and

598
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
you're just going to make it 10 times

599
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,720
even harder for us to try to get rights

600
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
and protections so

601
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
if you can

602
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
challenge that public perception thought

603
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,559
that means if you want to wear a text

604
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,840
you could wear a tux if you want to wear

605
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,120
a suit you can wear a suit if you want

606
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
to wear a gala dress go for it the thing

607
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,240
is

608
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
don't dress up like how everyone has

609
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,840
stereotyped the hacker community dress

610
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
differently because that makes someone

611
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
have to challenge their beliefs and

612
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
thoughts of what they think the world

613
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,400
works like

614
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
because the reality is that if we don't

615
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
do these things if we don't step up as a

616
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
community

617
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,200
we're going to keep having results in

618
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
the media and this is going to be our

619
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,240
continuous vicious cycle of an impact

620
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
such as that 94 percent of forbes 2000

621
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,240
still don't have vulnerability

622
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
disclosure policies

623
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
that means that anytime we find a

624
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,679
vulnerability and we want to report it

625
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
we don't know who to go to and this

626
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
becomes one of those situations that's

627
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
are hard because then we have to go

628
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,960
through social media to contact someone

629
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,880
which we know goes to the marketing team

630
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
and then the marketing team will either

631
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,480
block it from going to the security team

632
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,799
by bringing it to their legal team or pr

633
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,960
team this is a huge problem so

634
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,159
it's really important to have on really

635
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,159
disclosure policies the other thing is

636
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,360
that one out of four hackers don't

637
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
report vulnerabilities as we've covered

638
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,320
before why

639
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,159
and that the laws right now such as the

640
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,280
cfa and dmca is really holding us back

641
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
and it's really out of date i mean it's

642
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
from the 80s

643
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
we're not we're like really far from

644
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
then

645
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
um but also the prosecutive hackers

646
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
which we still see to this day and it's

647
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,679
not uh federally as much anymore i would

648
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,360
say since i think 2016 has been reduced

649
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
significantly instead we're having more

650
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,120
of it of

651
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,520
tech companies going after the hacker

652
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
community

653
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,640
and also you see it with local or county

654
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,280
and statewide they may be using the cfa

655
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
against you

656
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,240
um the other thing is because of our

657
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,679
situation

658
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,919
we're also making it almost impossible

659
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,720
for

660
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,679
you know

661
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,799
people to have this as their day job

662
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,880
um especially when we're gatekeeping

663
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
people in our community

664
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,440
they have the great skills to use and

665
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
they may turn to another way

666
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,720
um so then they can make an income

667
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
so this is something to think about is

668
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
that when we create a legal path and we

669
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,039
provide protection this will decrease

670
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,200
the number of bad actors instead and

671
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
that's something that we need to do

672
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,279
because the reason that some end up

673
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,279
going this route is because

674
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,440
they never got any rights or protection

675
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
they've been thrown too many times and

676
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,640
then they get to a point like what's the

677
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
point of me like doing all this stuff

678
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,240
and not even getting

679
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
paid for it or being treated this way

680
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,360
that's how you create bad actors

681
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,480
sometimes so it's something to consider

682
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,840
so

683
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,159
when you influence the media and media

684
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,080
does play a huge role in influence

685
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
legislation because politicians pay

686
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
attention to the press and also

687
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,720
political movements

688
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,799
and right now laws prevent good hacking

689
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
in the same way they prevent attackers

690
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
and we really do need good hacking

691
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,279
because it does keep us safe

692
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,400
and so

693
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
there are a couple of things to think of

694
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,480
so when it comes to

695
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
legislation that impacts us that is your

696
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
um anti-hacking laws in the u.s we have

697
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,120
the cfa

698
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
that also means your copyright laws in

699
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,559
the uss dmca

700
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
and also you have your

701
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,279
terms and conditions

702
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,039
so those are the three that play a

703
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,279
massive role when it comes to reporting

704
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,000
vulnerabilities but also being a hacker

705
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,520
in the community

706
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
and of course the good news is that with

707
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,679
the dmca we are having more of that

708
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,520
right to repair movement it's been in

709
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,400
the press quite a bit so fingers crossed

710
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,120
that will be updated some point soon

711
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,679
because it does play a chilling effect

712
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,799
for us

713
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,880
now on the cfa the reason i have a

714
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
problem with it is well first the

715
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
originals the origins if you don't know

716
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,799
is that

717
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,320
ronald reagan

718
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,520
basically watched war games and flat out

719
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,360
panicked it was like we gotta do

720
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,679
something about these hackers and so

721
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,480
basically created the cfa based off of

722
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
that movie war games that really made

723
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,559
him afraid of us

724
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,880
and of course when legislation was

725
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,000
written

726
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
our group was not part of that

727
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,000
conversation and when you don't have

728
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
interest groups in part of the

729
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,120
conversation when it comes to

730
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,240
legislation that's going to hurt a great

731
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,279
party right there um so it's

732
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,520
that's one of the issues so the cfa has

733
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
been misused by prosecution to go after

734
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
um hackers in the community it's also

735
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
very vague and there's lots of

736
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
redundancies in it and this is one of

737
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
those things that

738
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,440
it's such a pain to have

739
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,679
but unfortunately the cfa the other

740
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,880
thing to note about it it has been used

741
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,039
so many times against people in our

742
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,120
community and one of those cases which

743
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,000
is the most hardest one to think about

744
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
is aaron swartz

745
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
so in 2011 carmen ortez who was the u.s

746
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,440
attorney's office

747
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
role basically charged force worth

748
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
hacking into the mit computer network to

749
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
download millions of scholarly articles

750
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,440
from jstor

751
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
which was kind of an act of civil

752
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
disobedience

753
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
meant to protest the restricted access

754
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
to taxed

755
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,760
research because the research that

756
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,360
people were doing was funded by

757
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,600
taxpayers and so he wanted to make sure

758
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,279
that people had access to it because

759
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
they paid taxes to it

760
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
but because of that the u.s attorney

761
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,440
brought charges that carried a maximum

762
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,880
of 35 years in prison and one million

763
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
dollars in fines now i want you to

764
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,080
understand that for a case of murder in

765
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,840
the u.s the minimum is 25 years

766
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,679
he was looking at 35 years in prison

767
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,080
for articles

768
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,880
yeah it's kind of ridiculous because the

769
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
way that cfa is written

770
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,679
it allowed them to do that

771
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,960
and it's one of those things that if

772
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
if we were aaron in this situation

773
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,480
imagine that you were dealing with a

774
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
17-month long legal battle that you had

775
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,880
no idea when it was going to end

776
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
and

777
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
it must have been really overwhelming

778
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,640
for him

779
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
i cannot imagine what he went through on

780
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,279
that

781
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
and unfortunately we lost him he the

782
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
cause of death was due to suicide

783
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
um in his apartment

784
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
and so the one thing to keep in mind is

785
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
that after he passed away his family did

786
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,080
state that they believed that the reason

787
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,559
he ended his life was because

788
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,799
of these charges impacted him so

789
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,399
significantly and he was overwhelmed

790
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,120
and that is one of the things that

791
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,360
it is definitely not okay

792
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
that's letting you know we have a

793
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
problem

794
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,120
and yes there was a legislation that was

795
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,279
written called the aaron's law and

796
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,159
aaron's law was something that was

797
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,799
created to protect other secure

798
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,720
researchers so they don't have a

799
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,399
situation that aaron schwartz went

800
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,080
through and it was called the aaron's

801
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
law but unfortunately it was blocked um

802
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
and the reason for that was that there

803
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,440
was a good number of tech like big tech

804
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,080
companies that are lobbying and so this

805
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,279
prevented

806
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,600
aaron's law from becoming a reality

807
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,919
and that's where we stand today with cfa

808
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,039
is that we still have this problem

809
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,799
but if we have improvements with

810
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,679
legislation that means that forbes

811
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,480
global 2000 would all have on really

812
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,240
disclosure policies that means a hundred

813
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,840
percent of hackers could report

814
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,720
vulnerabilities without fear and also

815
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,039
they would be taken seriously but also

816
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,000
the laws that encourage good hacking

817
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,240
talk about gatekeeping right we could

818
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,480
get rid of gatekeeping and this would

819
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
help quite a bit

820
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,960
but also no more prosecuting packers

821
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
those are staying within scope and are

822
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,279
not using for malicious intent they

823
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,279
should be protected

824
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,799
and also it would definitely decrease

825
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,679
the number of malicious actors

826
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,880
so what can you do right now

827
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
be bold and be kind

828
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,600
but also note that by being bold it

829
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
means sharing our stories if we don't

830
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
someone else will

831
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,240
and you may not like what they say

832
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,080
so why not go forward about it

833
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
also voting

834
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
there's one thing that you should have

835
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
taken away in the past couple years is

836
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,159
vote your vote does matter

837
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,919
i know who your local representatives

838
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,720
are because you can always connect with

839
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,679
them and get a meeting and if you are

840
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,159
concerned or scared to do it alone feel

841
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,760
free to reach out to hackie's not a

842
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,720
crime

843
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
many of our members would love to help

844
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,559
you out and attend that meeting as well

845
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
and we can prep you for it as well

846
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,720
and step four of all this is to

847
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,360
collaborate with organizations

848
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,039
so first things first vulnerability

849
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,840
disclosure every single organization

850
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,760
especially those that are security

851
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,520
companies should have vulnerability

852
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,919
disclosure policies because without it

853
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,960
hackers

854
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,720
aren't going to report vulnerabilities

855
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
that they find instead

856
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,440
attackers are going to find the

857
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
vulnerabilities and never report it and

858
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
take advantage of you which one is

859
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,559
better

860
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,720
yeah that's what i thought

861
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,559
so why monitor the disclosure well it

862
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,320
reduces breaches because someone's

863
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,080
reporting that vulnerabilities because

864
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,159
diverse backgrounds

865
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,080
can't find bugs that your security team

866
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,559
cannot find and that's okay that doesn't

867
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,720
mean that you have a bad team that just

868
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,039
means that you need other outside

869
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,200
sources to help that's what we do as a

870
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,960
community

871
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,279
also it allows a bilateral trust between

872
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,039
oars and hackers to keep security in

873
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,679
check and let's be real with one another

874
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
scanners are great to a certain extent

875
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,039
but they really you can't rely on them

876
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,519
so how can you improve this is state

877
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,320
what's in scope and what's out of scope

878
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,480
and don't write it for attorneys write

879
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
it for english learners because there's

880
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,000
people all over the world that want to

881
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
report a vulnerability but they need to

882
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
also understand

883
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,880
now when it comes to like terms and

884
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,960
conditions when we look at say for

885
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,360
example an apple product sometimes those

886
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,519
things are 50 pages long and is written

887
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,519
for one attorney to another attorney to

888
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,640
understand this is a huge problem for us

889
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,399
make it very simple straight to the

890
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,200
point imagine english learners

891
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,519
contact information knowing who to

892
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,080
contact is incredibly important for many

893
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,880
of us

894
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,919
it is one of the pains in the world

895
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,240
because it'll take hours days weeks to

896
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
find contact information and then you

897
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,480
kind of give up if you can't find it so

898
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,760
you want to really state what your

899
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
contact information is

900
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
and communicate with every update all of

901
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,080
us want to know has it been patched yet

902
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,679
what does this look like having a good

903
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,600
conversation is really really important

904
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,279
so always have someone who's a point

905
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,279
person at your company to manage that

906
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,960
conversation

907
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,880
also having a dedicated person like i

908
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
said to manage and prioritize and task

909
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,120
that's something important if you can't

910
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,039
do that in house make sure that you look

911
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,200
at you know other companies that do such

912
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,840
as hacker one buck has

913
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,519
there's plenty of other ones out there

914
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,120
but it may be a good idea to do that

915
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
especially if you're a small shop or

916
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,600
medium sized shop

917
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
if you want some additional help on that

918
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,799
go to disclose.io it does provide you

919
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,320
everything you possibly know how to

920
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,000
create a good one really disclosure

921
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,240
policies they even have examples for you

922
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
as well but there's also this github

923
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,200
listing of all the companies that are

924
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,440
practicing safe harbor

925
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
and so that's something to also consider

926
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
so if your company is practicing safe

927
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,279
harbor or have vulnerability disclosure

928
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,760
policies make sure you add them to it

929
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
that list so then you know those that

930
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,159
are hackers in the community they can

931
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,399
find that and know who to contact

932
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,600
but i also know that this is an

933
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
organization that's supporting and

934
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
trying to protect hackers and wanting to

935
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,760
build that bridge between

936
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,320
and besides disclosure you can always

937
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
volunteer and give you can volunteer

938
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,640
time or finances but the thing is work

939
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,399
with these groups they're working so

940
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,200
hard to get rights for us so that's the

941
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,440
eff i'm the calvary cert cc cti league

942
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,679
disco.io and hack is that a crime

943
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,760
so big summary and i hope i'm doing good

944
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
on time here is get involved

945
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,879
by visiting hackie is not a crime to

946
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,719
learn how you can get involved early and

947
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,560
you can become an advocate with us as

948
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,719
well if you're interested

949
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,800
volunteer support orgs that are trying

950
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
to work to help the community

951
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,119
also feel free to record a video to tell

952
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,520
your story and participate in the hacker

953
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,800
stories project like i said you control

954
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,839
your story by

955
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,280
participating and remember to work with

956
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,599
the press and keep them informed

957
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480
and have as much empathy as possible and

958
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,239
be kind

959
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,199
because the reality is that we'll never

960
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,960
have change

961
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,839
unless you take that step forward or i

962
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,000
take that step forward and yeah one

963
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,960
person can make a huge difference

964
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,639
so by

965
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,040
wanting to change how the dynamics are

966
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
for the hackers in our community

967
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,359
change starts with you and me because we

968
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
have the ability to do that and i know

969
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,880
it seems like an impossible task

970
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
sometimes when we look at our community

971
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
and we're looking at legislation and we

972
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
know that politicians don't really know

973
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,040
too much about cyber security i know i

974
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,119
know i get it it's really hard but

975
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
that's why we have conversations with

976
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,040
them that's why we also work with the

977
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,280
press that's why we work with

978
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,720
organizations to have vulnerability

979
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,599
disclosure policies because

980
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,040
organizations and the press can help

981
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,920
influence legislators to take action

982
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,560
and we can start a movement

983
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,440
to try to get action as well

984
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,240
so thank you all so much for existing i

985
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,400
know i wrap things up probably early but

986
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,079
that's because i know that you may have

987
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,599
lots of questions and i want to make

988
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,599
sure that i can answer all of them to

989
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,359
the full depth of whatever you want to

990
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,359
ask
