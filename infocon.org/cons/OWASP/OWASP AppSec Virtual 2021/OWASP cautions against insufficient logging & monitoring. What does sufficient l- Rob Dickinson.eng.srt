[Music]

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,919
and really a pleasure to to be here

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,679
thanks for having me

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,480
so let's jump right in so the topic is

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,559
sufficient logging and monitoring for

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,840
your apis and that's also known as owasp

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,320
a10

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,039
and let me switch to the right

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,160
there we go

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,439
and i am rob dickinson i'm cto resurface

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,080
labs i'm easy to find online after this

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,760
talk on twitter

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,719
or by email

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
our agenda for today

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
will be introducing uh for anybody who

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
hasn't seen it already what is owasp a10

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,960
we'll be talking about some of the

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
challenges with implementing the a10

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,559
directive some best practices that

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,399
overcome those challenges and then

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,079
there'll be quite a bit of content here

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
about securing pii because pii turns out

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
to be one of the major

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,359
challenges that holds people back in

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
this area so we'll really be going deep

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,879
on on that

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,840
as uh one of the best sets of best

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,200
practices that we could be using

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,000
so this is the oau's top ten

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
i'm sure we've we've all seen this

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
and uh obviously not going to go through

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,920
all this list but just just to point out

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
that a10 is the the last one on the list

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,640
and

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
the what what that means

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
is that if we're in a nutshell is that

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
if we're running a digital property

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
that we really should have a

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
surveillance camera

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
for that digital property we don't want

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,920
attackers to be able to come onto our

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
property and break in and be unaware

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
that those activities are going on so we

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,000
need sufficient logging and monitoring

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
to know that our systems are actually

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
safe and that they're not being

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,119
exploited that sounds like a great idea

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,960
but in our experience and who and who

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
we're talking to

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,680
the a10 directive is usually the least

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
commonly addressed of of all those other

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,479
top ten issues

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,439
and that's because it's hard

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,239
it's a it's a simple idea it's simple to

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,120
state

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
but to actually do this

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
is is quite difficult and involves

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,280
challenges on a number of different

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
fronts

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
so why does this really matter

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,239
this really matters because to detect

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,680
breaches

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
we have to have a way of monitoring and

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
logging to be able to get to the point

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
where we can detect these breaches

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
respond to these breaches

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and the numbers that we've seen are very

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
very interesting

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
you know almost a 50 50 split between

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
the attacks that take that that happen

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
you know on purpose

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,840
versus the attacks that are successful

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,239
because somebody made a mistake

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,560
and that's i think really important so

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
about half the time somebody's doing it

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,440
to us and about half the time as

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,879
technologists we're doing this to

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
ourselves

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
the common thread though in all these

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,519
breaches

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,519
uh at least at least the vast majority

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
is that there's pii that's being

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
targeted in this and that makes sense

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
because that's really what the attackers

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
are out to get is that real customer pii

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
the email addresses the credit card

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,319
numbers

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,519
um

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680
you know sensitive data that you can use

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
for for fraud

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
um or other kinds of crime that's really

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
what these breaches are are all about

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
and unfortunately the numbers are not

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,120
great

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
these these attacks tend to run for a

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
long time

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,799
they do a lot of damage

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,040
and you know just looking at the numbers

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
it's it's hard to believe that we're

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
actually winning the war here uh online

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,720
so

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
this is really one of the classic

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
blunders

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
that you can fall victim to in running a

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
digital property today it's it's very

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
easy to

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,439
lose a lot of money

108
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
um through through these kinds of

109
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
breaches

110
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,400
and is that problem getting worse

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,879
yes it is it is absolutely getting worse

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,760
because we're moving to an api centric

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
economy

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
we're we're taking things that used to

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
be internal and we're exposing them

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
externally through these apis

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
we're going to find that the pace of all

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
these things actually accelerates

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,600
it's not going to get slower it's going

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,759
to speed up these apis are going to be

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
used in unexpected ways we're constantly

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
changing them

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
the old ways of measuring are falling

124
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,840
short in that a lot of our users used to

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
be web users and so you would instrument

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
a web browser with a javascript agent

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
and that's how you get the data

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,120
but in the case of apis it's not just

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,919
browsers in fact it it's usually not

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,720
browsers but there's a huge diversity in

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
the kinds of clients that are connecting

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,680
and so we need we need different tooling

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
the a lot of the api owners that we talk

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,759
to they really lack that complete

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
visibility into what's going on

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,960
and we know that security and privacy

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
are not just

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
ongoing issues but they're actually

139
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
moving targets what we mean by security

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
what we mean by attacks what kinds of

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
attacks we're guarding against that's a

142
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,840
moving target

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
also our notions about privacy when you

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,440
look at things like gdpr ccpa

145
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
those privacy directives are themselves

146
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
moving targets

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
so

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
all of these things come together to

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
really

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
create a huge observability problem in

151
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,919
general

152
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
and specifically around detecting these

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,440
breaches

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
and and knowing

155
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
when your apis are being used in ways

156
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
that that you didn't expect

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
so the a10 official recommendations

158
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,199
are

159
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
fairly simple to get your to get your

160
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,199
head around

161
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
in terms of what are the ideas of what

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,560
you actually need to solve for this

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,880
the the primary things you have to have

164
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
obviously is you need to have a

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
centralized database and you need to

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
have that be an append only store you

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
know you're you're putting your logs

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,440
you're putting your your your monitoring

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
data into this database and you don't

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
want hackers to be able to go in and

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
change

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
that database

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,800
right a lot of the hackers will try to

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
cover their tracks and so having that in

175
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
a centralized fashion

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
it's not on the host that's actually

177
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
being exploited the database lives

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
centrally and having it be an append

179
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
only store that's that's a really really

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,880
strong clear requirement

181
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
um another strong clear requirement is

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
we need to have enough storage in that

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,080
database to enable forensic analysis

184
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
that's you know that's the whole point

185
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
of this you have to be able to go in and

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,960
and mine that data to find out what's

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
going on

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
what you want ideally is you want

189
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
automatic detection and alerting for

190
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
suspicious

191
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,280
activities again these all come you know

192
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
as part of the the a10

193
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,840
kind of official uh official

194
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
recommendations

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,759
um in terms of the use case you want

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
that audit trail to cover things like

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
logins access validation failures high

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
value transactions

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,360
you know literally things in the real

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
world that you would want to get a

201
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
physical receipt for

202
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,560
you should have an audit trail of that

203
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
that's what should be in your in your

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
database and you should be able to mine

205
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
that data

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
a very important consideration

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
is that this data needs to be normalized

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
across the different kinds of log

209
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
sources that you have

210
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
this is actually itself one of the

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
classic blunders that you can have with

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,720
with data logging systems in general

213
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,599
and

214
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
it's it's really refreshing to see that

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
called out specifically in the official

216
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
recommendations because the data that's

217
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,960
going to be in this database and in the

218
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
audit trail is really only as good

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,919
as as it was when it arrived and was

220
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,039
normalized so data hygiene

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
especially across a diversity of sources

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,440
is is super important

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
we need protections against sensitive

224
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,759
data leakage

225
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
that is an easy idea to say

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
it's a much harder idea to implement

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
and we're going to have a big section of

228
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
of content here

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,199
in in a few minutes that really goes

230
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
into more of the details

231
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
around this but obviously

232
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,640
we're we're gathering sensitive data um

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,599
even if it's not classic pii

234
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,320
to to really be able to enable forensic

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,399
analysis you have to have enough detail

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,880
to to do that effectively

237
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
you're going to end up having sensitive

238
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
details as part of that and so now you

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
have to have protections

240
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
around handling that sensitive data and

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
that's super important

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,839
the last thing that a10 calls out is

243
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
that you have to validate these logging

244
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,920
systems you have to train on these login

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,399
systems as part of your incident plan

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,160
it's certainly not enough just to put

247
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
the technology in place it's not enough

248
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
just to gather the data your team really

249
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
has to understand how to use this system

250
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
because when you're going to be using it

251
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
it's probably going to be under pressure

252
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,959
as as part of an incident

253
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,600
so again this is kind of easy to say

254
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,720
out loud

255
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,800
but what we're really talking about here

256
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
when you talk about a business

257
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,959
implementation of these recommendations

258
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
this is pretty significant

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
this this is not as easy as saying

260
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
let's scrub all our inputs for command

261
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
injection or let's guard against

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
cross-site scripting attacks

263
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
this covers a lot of ground there's a

264
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
lot of complexity here

265
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
and these these solutions can be very

266
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480
very expensive

267
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
these all go into

268
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
the the reasoning

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,880
why mo why more more folks aren't

270
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,480
solving for a10 on on a daily basis

271
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
so let's go a little bit more into what

272
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,079
those challenges really look like and

273
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
why this is so hard

274
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
it's hard to get started just gathering

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
all this data

276
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,600
normalizing the data dealing with the

277
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,839
data hygiene it's hard to get started

278
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
then once you have all this data it's

279
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
hard to know what to look for

280
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
it's hard to know what signals to be

281
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
paying attention to

282
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,720
a lot of the folks that we talk to are

283
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
completely overwhelmed with with the

284
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
data that they have

285
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
these are much higher data volumes than

286
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
just system logging events or apm

287
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
logging events we're talking about lot

288
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,959
of logging all of the activity all of

289
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,320
the usage

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
that is large data volumes especially if

291
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,959
your payloads are inherently large

292
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,399
there's significant assembly for this

293
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
can you grab splunk can you grab elastic

294
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
absolutely you can grab a logging

295
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
platform like that but there's

296
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
significant assembly required to get to

297
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,959
something that that actually meets all

298
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
of those a10

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
directives and then there's the notion

300
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
of operational support who's going to

301
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,839
run that system

302
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,240
um this is a multi-disciplinary

303
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
initiative

304
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,720
this cut this includes big data

305
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,200
this includes data analytics this

306
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
includes devops it includes security it

307
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,440
includes privacy um

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,720
you know your legal team will be

309
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
involved in portions of that

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,920
this covers a lot of ground

311
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,320
there's also limited talent out there to

312
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
help build and assemble these systems so

313
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,279
all of this boils down to

314
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,200
uh

315
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,399
you know and then and then the other

316
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,640
things i i almost skipped over here but

317
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
there's uh there's the potential for

318
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,240
gatekeeping by the tech staff you know

319
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
you have staff that kind of owns the

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,320
system and locks it away and no one else

321
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
can really get to it and and the biggest

322
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
challenge as i mentioned before

323
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
is is really securing pii at run time

324
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
and when we talk to

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,920
folks

326
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
that's really you know you put all of

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
this together and it's it's kind of

328
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
challenges across the board there's

329
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
there's no easy button here it's it's

330
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
not like you can just say yeah just

331
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
don't don't pay attention to the stuff

332
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
that's really behind the curtain we're

333
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
just gonna we're just gonna log all this

334
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,480
stuff and it's going to be okay

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,959
you really have to be prepared

336
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,320
to

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
to get into all of these different kinds

338
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,920
of challenges

339
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,600
and and solve a pretty broad set of

340
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
problems here

341
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,079
and frankly that's why more folks aren't

342
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,760
solving for a10 on their own

343
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
now that said now that we've sketched

344
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
out what the what some of the challenges

345
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
are around this there are some very

346
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,639
clear

347
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,279
easy best practices that we can adopt

348
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
that really help cut through some of the

349
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
noise that we get into and really what

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,760
this is about

351
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
is it's about togetherness

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,399
it's about working together it's about

353
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
being able to share data share telemetry

354
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,240
with each other

355
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,920
that's really the the aspiration here

356
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
that that's really i believe is behind

357
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
the the a-10 directive it's really about

358
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
the idea of let's get on a road where

359
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,079
we're taking this logging data we're

360
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
taking this alerting that we're getting

361
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
and we're really using that to break

362
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,519
down some of these walls that exist

363
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
between the development team and the

364
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
security team traditionally

365
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,680
and to really create more of a devsecops

366
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,800
culture

367
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
where both the development team and the

368
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,279
security analysts have common data sets

369
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
to rally around and to really understand

370
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
what's going on

371
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
again going back to those numbers about

372
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
the breaches

373
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,519
if half of our breaches are coming from

374
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
quality problems and half of our

375
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,519
breaches are coming from active

376
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,720
attackers

377
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
then just the development team on their

378
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
own or just the security team on their

379
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,920
own can't really solve that problem it

380
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,880
has to be the combination of all those

381
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
people working together

382
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
and creating that continuous improvement

383
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,480
workflow

384
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
we also ca another way of saying that is

385
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
we can't live just on perimeter security

386
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,760
alone we have to better harden our

387
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
systems to resist those attacks

388
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,399
and knowledge about those attacks and be

389
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,800
able to observe those attacks

390
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
is the the first thing that you have to

391
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,680
solve for to really be able to resist

392
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
those attacks

393
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
in terms of making that easy

394
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,320
there is a

395
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
generation of tools that are being built

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
and shameless plug resurface is one of

397
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,000
these

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
that is really purpose-built around this

399
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
use case of logging api usage

400
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
and what this does is this cuts down the

401
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,720
cost pretty dramatically

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
from the very high cost of taking

403
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
something like an elastic or a general

404
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,880
purpose logging tool and adapting that

405
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,839
to

406
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,959
um

407
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,760
for an api logging kind of use case

408
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
dealing with all the data hygiene and

409
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
the ingestion and all the stuff that

410
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
comes into that then setting up the

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,079
dashboarding setting up the alerting

412
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,839
loading all that knowledge

413
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,279
into it

414
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,959
resurface is one of the the first

415
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,240
products that's really showing the

416
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,839
potential here

417
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,000
to be able to cut through all of that

418
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
and and have a very easy turnkey

419
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
platform

420
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,279
that allows you to do zero-day analysis

421
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
and have those embedded privacy and

422
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,279
security controls so that you're not

423
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,759
having to overlay these concerns

424
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
over and over again

425
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,240
once you have that system of record

426
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,519
the other thing that you're going to

427
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,720
find

428
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,759
is that it's not just useful for solving

429
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,880
a10

430
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
but this also has benefits across the

431
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
entire software development life cycle

432
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
obviously we've talked a lot about here

433
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
in in production and and production

434
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279
security monitoring you know that's

435
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,160
that's the obvious but again this this

436
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
what we can really do with this is now

437
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,199
take that next step towards feeding that

438
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,920
information back into

439
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
the the other areas of the organization

440
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
that can really benefit from it if you

441
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,519
think about it

442
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,959
one of the things that we hear from

443
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
security people and people that work in

444
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,560
production all the time

445
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
is i wish i could get my development

446
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,199
team to care more about the quality

447
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
problems we're having i wish i could get

448
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,000
my development team to care more about

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
the security issues that we're seeing

450
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
but that's really hard to do if testing

451
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
in qa is operating in their bubble and

452
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
development saying it works on my

453
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,079
machine

454
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
we need to be able to take this data

455
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,600
take these logs but what's really

456
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
happening in production and be able to

457
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,880
provide that to the to the groups in our

458
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,199
in our organizations that actually need

459
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,680
that data so that we're not all

460
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
collectively guessing about what's

461
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
really going on that that we really have

462
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
we really can take a data oriented

463
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,520
approach

464
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,839
so this is really the promise

465
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,359
of a10 it's not just about

466
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,079
sufficient monitoring and logging it's

467
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,039
really about putting yourself on a road

468
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
to continuous improvement

469
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
and being able to do that in a very well

470
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,360
informed

471
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
very empirical fashion

472
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
instead of instead of having to guess

473
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
so that's a great message it's a great

474
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,240
story so hopefully i've convinced you

475
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,320
that that's that that's important and

476
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,960
that's then that that's a worthwhile

477
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,679
um you know that a10 should be on your

478
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,280
list of things that you're trying to to

479
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,640
solve for

480
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
and another way of saying that is that

481
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
this is a way for us to move from

482
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
assuming

483
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
that all of our attacks will be

484
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,520
terminated at the perimeter

485
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
to really acknowledging

486
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
how often those attacks are actually

487
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
penetrating the perimeter how often

488
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
those folks are actually getting inside

489
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
and and being inside our systems for a

490
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,160
long time and doing damage for a long

491
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
time so we can't just

492
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
play the whack-a-mole game of

493
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,559
uh

494
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,960
of blocking people at the perimeter when

495
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,679
they do bad things

496
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
we have to be able to sufficiently log

497
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
and monitor what's going on on our own

498
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
digital properties

499
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
and feed that back feed that information

500
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
back into the organization so that we

501
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
can really truly build stronger api

502
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,120
services

503
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,039
in in the process

504
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,640
so again that's the

505
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
that's the aspiration and that sounds

506
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,039
great but again why are people not doing

507
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,160
this more

508
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
um

509
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
one of the key things that comes into

510
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
this and one of the key things that we

511
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,360
hear just over and over and over again

512
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
is is first of all that there aren't

513
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
enough turnkey solutions

514
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
and again resurface is one of the

515
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,799
solutions that can be an easy button for

516
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,440
that but the thing that we hear a lot

517
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,559
is well hang on to really do that i'm

518
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,520
going to have to work with pii

519
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,480
because

520
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,400
if this data is highly anonymized

521
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,760
if it's only system monitoring data

522
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
that doesn't really tell me a lot about

523
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
my attackers it doesn't tell me a lot

524
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
about the usage of that system so

525
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,760
when we're talking about sufficient

526
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
logging and monitoring it can't just be

527
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,679
what code is running on the box it can't

528
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
just be what things are slow

529
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
it really needs to include what things

530
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,280
are

531
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
presumably working correctly

532
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
and to really understand all of that

533
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
you're ultimately going to have pii

534
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,799
involved in that you're ultimately going

535
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,799
to want to know well what was the

536
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,880
account that was being used what was the

537
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,679
user that was involved

538
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,799
that is a that is a key part of this

539
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,080
and

540
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
but that is also

541
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
you know brings along its own

542
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
requirements and i think we all

543
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,919
understand

544
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,440
that that once you once you make that

545
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
once you make that decision and you're

546
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,720
going to say okay i'm going to do this

547
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,280
and there's going to be pii involved

548
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,000
now your problem just got even tougher

549
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
to deal with so let's go through this so

550
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,679
already maybe i'm triggering some

551
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,559
feelings that you already have about pii

552
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,000
and that's good

553
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,799
it gives almost everyone a headache like

554
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
nobody hears about the challenges around

555
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
pii and goes yay let's let's do like

556
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,960
this is hard right these are hard topics

557
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,360
to get into there's a fair amount of

558
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
denial that is still around this you

559
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,400
know i know gdpr is out there but it's

560
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,919
going to take a while for it to really

561
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,960
happen

562
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
let's just focus on something else

563
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,240
um

564
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
you know pii is not necessarily a

565
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,400
favorite topic

566
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
um

567
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,720
there's also

568
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
some folks that we talked to just kind

569
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,440
of a general sense of dread like yeah

570
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
we're doing this

571
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
we know we can't keep doing what we're

572
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
doing you know we know that we're not

573
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
really protecting this information the

574
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,919
way that we need to we know it's only a

575
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,280
matter of time

576
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,039
and this this really isn't going to work

577
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
out very well but we're doing the best

578
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,919
that we can with what we have uh you

579
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
know available to us right now so it's

580
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
actually totally okay if you feel like

581
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,679
this

582
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,280
and i'm going to give you a couple of

583
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,679
very practical strategies that we can

584
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,840
use to help cut through some of this

585
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,760
hopefully give you a little bit more

586
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,159
comfort with with these with with some

587
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,840
of these topics

588
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,440
the other thing of course that triggers

589
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
a lot of us is that we know that

590
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,159
insecure handling of pii

591
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,320
uh is is getting very expensive whether

592
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
that's admitting our breaches

593
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,200
um or or however you want to break down

594
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
the the cost of that

595
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
um there are really significant

596
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,480
business level costs so this is not a

597
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,280
purely technical consideration

598
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,080
for

599
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,400
businesses in in general

600
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
this is your brand at stake this is this

601
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,720
is your reputation at stake

602
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
all right so as we said as soon as you

603
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,120
go down this road and you're gonna work

604
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
with pii you now have

605
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,559
a

606
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,840
really expansive set of challenges

607
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,360
on top of

608
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
all the other challenges that we already

609
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,880
talked about

610
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,919
for solving for a10

611
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,159
we have tightening regulations things

612
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,400
like gdpr ccpa that are slowly and and

613
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
slowly establishing higher levels of

614
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,159
care higher standards of care that are

615
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,840
that are tougher to

616
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,760
reach we're seeing a very rapid rate of

617
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,120
change

618
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,159
in

619
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,400
all of these regulations

620
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
um across the board

621
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,120
they're changing almost month to month

622
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
especially in europe as new court cases

623
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,760
are coming about and issued

624
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
we also have a really expanding ever

625
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,039
expanding definitions

626
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,559
of what what pii is really about

627
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
you know when when i got first got

628
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
started doing this you know pii was

629
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,320
credit card numbers

630
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,200
um

631
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
now those definitions have been expanded

632
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,120
and

633
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
your

634
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,880
your what what is considered pii

635
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
i mean under gdpr it's what 16 18

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
different kinds of data elements

637
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,360
and that set of data elements is being

638
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,520
expanded all the time

639
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,799
um so that in itself this is this is a

640
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,440
highly moving target when we're going

641
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,799
into to this set of challenges

642
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,400
there's a lot of vendors there's a lot

643
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
of platforms

644
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,559
where this data ends up living

645
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,080
all of those vendors and all those

646
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,799
platforms have a slightly different take

647
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,840
on

648
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
how we're going to protect this

649
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
information

650
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
where that information is stored what

651
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
database is used

652
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,039
and there's a of course there's a huge

653
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,960
diversity here to consider

654
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,400
one of the other things that we hear

655
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,120
about just all the time

656
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,400
is

657
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
can we change the application or the

658
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,039
database or not

659
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
is the original development team

660
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
involved

661
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
was this an application that was bought

662
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,760
from a third party

663
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,600
that maybe the third party isn't

664
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,919
prioritizing

665
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,760
security and prioritizing handling a pii

666
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,400
and how do you how do you wrangle that

667
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,600
in that case

668
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,799
um and again that's one of those really

669
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,120
persistent concerns

670
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
especially when you look at the the rate

671
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,559
of change i mean

672
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
when you have a case where new kinds of

673
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,320
data are being classified as pii

674
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,440
then

675
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
the only way that you can react to that

676
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
is seemingly to have an ability to

677
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,520
change the app or change your databases

678
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,600
to deal with that but that's simply not

679
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
the case

680
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,240
in with a lot of the folks that we

681
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
talked to you know you've grown through

682
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
acquisition

683
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
you have you have development teams that

684
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,039
have come and gone

685
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,360
and your ability to change things may

686
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
not be may not be that easy and it

687
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
certainly is not easy to change things

688
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,799
across the board

689
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,799
there are also many many many different

690
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,279
techniques for security and privacy

691
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,720
protection

692
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
there's encryption there's

693
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,000
de-identification

694
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,880
there's dynamic de-identification there

695
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,919
are all kinds of tricks and techniques

696
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
that we can use to protect this data

697
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
and there's no one size fits all for

698
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,600
that you can't just say we'll encrypt

699
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,840
everything as an example

700
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,720
um it's it's really not that easy you

701
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
have to pick the right technique for the

702
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,240
right use case and to really understand

703
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,279
and so

704
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,039
we're going to have to first of all

705
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,279
we're going to couch all of this

706
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,320
in in the context of an api economy

707
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,440
right

708
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,520
we know that security and privacy of

709
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,960
apis

710
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
is fundamentally different than for

711
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
websites because we're talking about

712
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
programmatic access and there's

713
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
different ways to exploit that data

714
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,279
so

715
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
i i would hazard i would hazard to say

716
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
we're even having to invent new kinds of

717
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,120
security and privacy protections for

718
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
apis that we've really never had to

719
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
consider before

720
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,320
there is truly no easy button for this

721
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
you can't just

722
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,840
get a pii solution in a box that that

723
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,679
handles this for for all your data

724
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,640
sources

725
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,120
for for all your needs that that simply

726
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,640
is not not a practical way to uh to

727
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
approach this and again that's one of

728
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
the things that makes it so challenging

729
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,240
to implement something like a10

730
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
you can't just you know other than

731
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,640
resurface maybe coming close

732
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,679
um

733
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
it's very difficult right now just to go

734
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,720
out and buy a solution that is an a10

735
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
compliant solution

736
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,240
that you can just roll in that that

737
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,159
truly is an easy button

738
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,279
um

739
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,360
again other than other than something

740
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,840
like resurface that's really ostensibly

741
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,039
designed

742
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,720
to uh

743
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,440
to solve that kind of problem

744
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,919
there's a high cost of compliance

745
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,399
and a high cost of non-compliance

746
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,399
if you're if you're getting into this

747
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,360
business of storing pii

748
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,440
we also have to tackle notions like

749
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,279
security by default

750
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,320
this is something that gdpr and ccpa

751
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
emphasize

752
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,200
that

753
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
both security by default and privacy by

754
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,120
default

755
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
which is another one of those things

756
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,679
that

757
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
is really really good aspirationally and

758
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,399
in terms of setting

759
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,399
setting this up as a as a standard of

760
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
care

761
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,840
but not really helpful it specifically

762
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,640
instead in terms of saying well what

763
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
specifically should those defaults be

764
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,399
the other thing that we mentioned we

765
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,919
were talking about the the software

766
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,840
development life cycle

767
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
that

768
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,559
really has a huge a huge impact on this

769
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,240
is that we want to be able to look to

770
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,279
legitimately share this data within our

771
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,720
organization

772
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,360
with the people who really need it

773
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,799
and

774
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,240
because again if we're if we're

775
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
anonymizing all this data

776
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
to the point that you're losing the

777
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
context

778
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
of who the customer actually is

779
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,039
what do you do in that process you

780
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,279
anonymize all your data down to system

781
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,960
level data

782
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,600
and that system level data is really

783
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,919
only useful for engineering

784
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,240
now it's incredibly useful for

785
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,600
engineering

786
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,279
but it's not helpful in terms of

787
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
customer support it's not helpful in

788
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
terms of data analytics

789
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
at the customer level at the session

790
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,520
level

791
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
and also at the session level or at the

792
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,559
at the customer journey level um all of

793
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,480
that requires

794
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,120
having some notion of pii

795
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,559
some notion

796
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,600
of of you know some some details at that

797
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,640
level

798
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,279
and that can't just be held by the

799
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,480
security team it can't just be held by

800
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,720
by the development team we need to get

801
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,200
that data out to to where it's needed

802
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,360
there's also new requirements

803
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,039
that are coming into pii handling that

804
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,960
we've really not seen before

805
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
historically i mean you could say a lot

806
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
of the things that we've talked about so

807
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,919
far

808
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,760
they're not really gdpr specific or ccpa

809
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,880
specific

810
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,159
a lot of the things that we've talked

811
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,720
about so far

812
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,159
really would fall under something like

813
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,520
pci

814
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
you know especially if you're talking

815
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,760
about handling credit card numbers for

816
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,640
example we've had pretty strong notions

817
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,880
about data protections for that kind of

818
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,080
pii

819
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,679
for a long time

820
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,679
but if you haven't seen this yet

821
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,559
one of the things that gdpr and ccpa and

822
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,240
similar legislation is going to bring

823
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,360
with it

824
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,919
is the right to erasure or the right to

825
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,360
be forgotten

826
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
so that means we need to be able to

827
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,240
implement

828
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,960
a revocation process

829
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,279
for any of the pii that we're handling

830
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
for any of the systems that are involved

831
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,120
in handling that pii this is a really

832
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
brand new idea

833
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,640
and

834
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,399
getting back to that idea that they're

835
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,240
they're no they're they're not being an

836
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
easy button for this

837
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,559
you know there's there's very very few

838
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,240
databases that natively implement this

839
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,679
concept

840
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,640
yet

841
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,720
um the idea that as a consumer

842
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
i should be able to say hey

843
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,840
i'm revoking my rights for you to use my

844
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,120
data anymore and how how does the

845
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,080
business

846
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
how does the how does the devops team

847
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,039
actually implement that requirement

848
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,679
in in a way that's easy

849
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,960
again

850
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,320
part of the problem here is that there's

851
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,159
a lot of vendors there's a lot of

852
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,960
platforms this data gets stored in a lot

853
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,039
of different ways

854
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,799
and

855
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,559
it's difficult to go back and change

856
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
these applications

857
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,919
so

858
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,080
you think about you know

859
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,279
this as a as a highly moving target

860
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,799
right

861
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,480
in some ways

862
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,519
our systems are fundamentally brittle

863
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
and now we're having to address

864
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,600
new requirements that we've never really

865
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,960
heard of before

866
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
like revocation

867
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,840
in the context of apps that may be

868
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,320
extremely difficult or literally

869
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,120
impossible to change

870
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
you can see why

871
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,120
as we're as as we're going through more

872
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
and more and more this list

873
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
a lot of folks wash out on the side of

874
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,399
maybe we just shouldn't do this

875
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,480
maybe the maybe the challenges here are

876
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
just too steep

877
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,720
to to to really want to get into all

878
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,960
this

879
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,919
the other way that

880
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,440
should the other thing that should be

881
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,360
always on our mind

882
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,760
is that all of these systems regardless

883
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,640
of

884
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,480
how good we think they are

885
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,200
they're always vulnerable to zero-day

886
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,279
failures and attacks

887
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,720
and so

888
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,480
that is also a very scary idea

889
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,399
that you could

890
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,120
go through a lot of work to identify the

891
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,440
requirements that you need to meet for

892
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440
security for proper handling of pii

893
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,960
and that you can still have a

894
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,360
vulnerability in that system that can be

895
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,679
exploited at any time

896
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,880
in a way that you didn't expect

897
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
and again

898
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
just to keep beating this drone

899
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,519
but

900
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,720
in the context of applications that may

901
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,279
be difficult to change or databases that

902
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,240
may be difficult to change or

903
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,039
applications that are fundamentally

904
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,679
evolving very quickly and moving very

905
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,679
quickly and that velocity and that rate

906
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,159
of change

907
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
means that you're you're exposing new

908
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,279
you're constantly exposing new ways of

909
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,600
of being exposed through zero-day

910
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,240
failures and attacks

911
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
um and

912
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
that threat

913
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,600
never really goes away

914
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,320
you know when you it it it doesn't have

915
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,120
to be zero day is is the other variation

916
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
of that right as as we all know

917
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,000
that could very well be a case where you

918
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,960
you made a mistake two years ago

919
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
and someone just figured out how to

920
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,359
exploit it in some really really clever

921
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,679
way that that no one ever thought about

922
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,280
in advance

923
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
and suddenly you have to be able to

924
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,480
respond

925
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,639
to that because you're leaking pii

926
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,839
one of the things that we keep coming

927
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,239
back to here in this theme

928
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,199
is that how to get developer attention

929
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,879
around these things

930
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,320
you know our developers that are

931
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,639
maintaining these systems have a lot on

932
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,719
their plate there are a lot of different

933
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,560
things that they're trying to do they're

934
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,239
trying to build new features they're

935
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,000
trying to improve quality they're trying

936
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,918
to include performance they're trying to

937
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,520
build scale

938
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,839
you know there's there's so many things

939
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,599
that that go into that

940
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,520
it's really hard to get developers

941
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,719
attention

942
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,720
especially in

943
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
a field like this that is very quickly

944
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,839
moving

945
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
is very nuanced and

946
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
truly takes takes a lot of education to

947
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,200
get comfortable with the subject matter

948
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,520
all right so

949
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,480
another way to put this is to

950
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,599
um and kind of a a fun way to put this

951
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,839
and a way to tell a couple stories here

952
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,480
is to talk about some anti-patterns

953
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,200
around how to handle pii

954
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,240
and and and to deal with user privacy

955
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,160
so let's just assume

956
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,560
that we're gonna do the a10 let's assume

957
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,800
that we need that surveillance camera

958
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
for our digital property

959
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
and and we want to be able to detect

960
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
these things um

961
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,839
we're going to be gathering this pii

962
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,320
and so what are some easy ways that this

963
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,720
whole thing can go wrong and we can we

964
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,880
can just blow ourselves up and really

965
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,359
wrap ourselves around the axle here

966
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,839
um and i and i think i've seen like

967
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,760
almost all of these myself not at

968
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,320
resurface but in other places that i've

969
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,160
that i've worked

970
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,680
over the years

971
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,839
um one very very crisp clear

972
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,119
anti-pattern that you should know when

973
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,359
you see it is the no pii here strategy

974
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,520
this is the strategy that says we're

975
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,760
just going to anonymize all of our data

976
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
and we don't really we don't really deal

977
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,480
in customer data we don't really

978
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
deal in that kind of stuff and you can

979
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,160
you can almost hear how ludicrous it

980
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,320
sounds out loud right because

981
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
what what business doesn't have

982
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,920
customers

983
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,320
what what organization

984
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,680
sustains itself without managing to have

985
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,839
any pii

986
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,720
um

987
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,560
even if you're a non-profit even if

988
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,720
you're not a commercial entity

989
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,400
you probably still have a subscriber

990
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,040
base of some kind or you have a group of

991
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
mobile users or you have some kind of

992
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,000
group

993
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,680
anytime you have humans you have pii so

994
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,040
you will hear

995
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,119
you will hear some folks you know some

996
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,200
of the denialists that are out there

997
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,359
it's like it's okay gdpr is fine we're

998
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,040
not going to worry about that because

999
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,520
we'll scrub out all of our pii before it

1000
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,040
gets to us and we won't really have to

1001
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,400
worry about it

1002
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,839
well guess what

1003
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,400
we're in a landscape where that idea of

1004
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,440
what is pii is constantly expanding

1005
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,560
so

1006
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
good luck with that

1007
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,599
the antithesis of that uh

1008
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,079
that perspective is we'll treat all of

1009
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,480
our data like it's pii

1010
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,560
and that sounds good maybe um until you

1011
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,839
think it through

1012
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,000
um it's a little bit like saying

1013
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
plutonium is dangerous therefore we'll

1014
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,000
just treat everything like it's

1015
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280
plutonium in the physical world um that

1016
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,680
would be ridiculous right um that that

1017
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,800
would not be a very economical way to to

1018
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
address those issues

1019
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,920
um but i have i have myself had managers

1020
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,000
at times that have that have tried to

1021
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
mandate this

1022
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,079
as as kind of a shortcut to pii

1023
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,359
compliance and it doesn't really work

1024
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,280
you're always going to have to fit the

1025
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,000
data to the use case fit the protections

1026
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,599
to the use case

1027
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,040
and and

1028
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,880
uh and go from there the other thing

1029
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,480
that i've seen

1030
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,599
i won't say where i saw this but uh but

1031
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,760
you have what's basically an impossible

1032
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
approval process you'll say oh yeah um

1033
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
there are ways that we can gather new

1034
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,320
pii but it needs to go to legal it needs

1035
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,160
to go the executive team it needs to

1036
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,320
have this sign off and that sign off

1037
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,560
and and basically nobody ever gets

1038
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
through that process

1039
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,079
like it's you just you just lose

1040
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,760
interest and say

1041
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
we'll we'll just we'll just live without

1042
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,240
the the sufficient logging bit because

1043
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,760
we'll just we'll never be able to get it

1044
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,240
approved

1045
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,720
another classic anti-pattern is having

1046
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,119
what we call god mode administrators

1047
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,880
people that can see everything about

1048
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,400
anything whenever they want to

1049
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,640
if you have a culture that is built

1050
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,280
around that idea that can be very

1051
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,359
difficult to unwind

1052
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,720
very difficult to unwind

1053
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,680
and we'll talk about why

1054
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,280
failing to get user consent this is a a

1055
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,079
new concept this is this is a gdpr ccpa

1056
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,680
kind of concept

1057
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,760
this is the idea that our system should

1058
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,800
be private by default secure by default

1059
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,599
so

1060
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,520
part of that is that the consent to be

1061
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,640
monitored

1062
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,760
has to be an explicit opt-in

1063
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,760
it can't be monitoring by default

1064
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,560
that creates some real challenges here

1065
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,480
so how do you get user consent

1066
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,960
you either ask for it

1067
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,359
or you have specific areas of your

1068
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,119
application that are governed by

1069
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,000
specific terms and conditions

1070
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,560
where you're specifying the context

1071
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,119
where you need to get consent

1072
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
the other thing about ccpa and gdpr is a

1073
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,359
lot about

1074
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,160
getting user consent is also whether the

1075
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,800
data stays first party or whether that

1076
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,920
data is shared with a third party

1077
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,319
and you have different requirements

1078
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,160
based for around user consent

1079
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,520
specifically

1080
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
based on

1081
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,000
so i got ahead of my bullet there but

1082
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,160
based on whether that data is being

1083
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,400
shared with a third party

1084
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,839
and that makes sense right

1085
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,400
so failing to get user consent

1086
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,760
or just automatically sharing that data

1087
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
with third parties

1088
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,440
um that is going to run you afoul

1089
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,640
of things like gdpr and ccpa

1090
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,200
that that really have a lot of specific

1091
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,160
language and specific teeth

1092
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,760
around governing

1093
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,079
especially governing the the third party

1094
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,599
data transfers

1095
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,680
and requiring

1096
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,920
you to have user consent

1097
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,200
for for

1098
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,359
third-party data transfers that aren't

1099
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,319
explicitly required for the the

1100
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,480
transaction that the user is is trying

1101
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,119
to conduct with you

1102
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,480
all right so a lot of those that we've

1103
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,800
talked about so far

1104
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
are kind of cultural

1105
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
anti-patterns those are mistakes that

1106
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,319
your your your managers might make or

1107
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,520
your architects um might might make from

1108
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,119
from that perspective

1109
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,480
there's a whole other set of

1110
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,359
anti-patterns in terms of the technology

1111
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,960
that you should be aware of and you

1112
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,640
should be attuned to

1113
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
and i want to thank

1114
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,359
paul

1115
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
for asking the question up front

1116
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
um is there is there such a thing as too

1117
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,760
much logging yes there actually is and

1118
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,240
and it is an anti-pattern and it's

1119
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,920
called the honeypot

1120
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,839
you take all your data and you put it in

1121
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,000
this one giant database

1122
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,240
and everybody wants to get in there and

1123
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,640
get it you know if you have one database

1124
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,720
that has all your credit card numbers

1125
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,359
for example then that ends up being a

1126
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,560
honeypot

1127
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,480
um if you're logging too much pii and

1128
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,680
not protecting that data properly in

1129
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,119
this database

1130
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,960
that is going to

1131
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,000
increase

1132
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,839
your your probability of getting

1133
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,800
breached

1134
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
it's going to increase

1135
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
your the chances of

1136
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,240
financial damages either from a breach

1137
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,800
or from something like like a gdpr or

1138
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
ccpa

1139
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,599
damage award

1140
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,040
um

1141
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
you know as much as we want to

1142
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,960
centralize this data get all this data

1143
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,480
in one place

1144
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,760
yes you absolutely can can log too much

1145
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,359
especially if you don't have proper

1146
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,040
protections in place

1147
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,000
and so

1148
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
that's one of those things like if you

1149
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,720
hear like oh we're just going to take

1150
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,160
all this data and we're putting this one

1151
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,000
giant database ooh yeah really i mean

1152
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,680
the the hair on the back of your neck

1153
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,280
should start to start to stand up a

1154
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,240
little bit

1155
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,280
uh overly destructive transforms

1156
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,119
are another example of this we'll just

1157
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,440
destroy all the pii we won't be able to

1158
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,920
recreate it like that's great you you

1159
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,160
get you protect the pii but you lose all

1160
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,720
your observability

1161
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
another thing we see all the time is

1162
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,280
just doing the one-time masking

1163
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,560
um we'll mask out the the data

1164
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
we'll do that at right time and then

1165
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,640
that's okay like we'll we'll be we'll be

1166
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,240
set from then on

1167
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,680
you know perimeter security will be

1168
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,560
enough

1169
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,800
we'll just encrypt everything

1170
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,319
um

1171
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,160
and we'll we'll really just be thinking

1172
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,640
about this in production

1173
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,960
these are really all examples of ways

1174
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,079
that that you're handling a pii can go

1175
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,160
terribly terribly wrong

1176
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,359
so

1177
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,160
let's give you some specific strategies

1178
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,079
in in the time that we have here left

1179
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,560
together to to go through uh

1180
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,000
some of the positive ways that we can

1181
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,400
actually deal with this

1182
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,800
you need to recognize that people are

1183
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,520
always the weakest length link

1184
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
and when we're talking about security in

1185
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,359
general or we're talking about pii

1186
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,560
specifically

1187
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,880
it's all about the people

1188
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,800
and what you're always trying to do in

1189
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,480
security is you're trying to optimize

1190
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,880
for the number of conspirators that are

1191
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,640
required to pull off that attack

1192
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,119
and it's really as simple as that so we

1193
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,000
want to take our permissions we want to

1194
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
be able to express group level and user

1195
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,480
level permissions we want to be able to

1196
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,560
express those very narrowly

1197
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,480
we want to be able to change those very

1198
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,400
fluidly at run time

1199
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,079
to be able to respond to things like

1200
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,000
zero day attacks or things

1201
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,920
zero day failures that we didn't think

1202
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,359
of in advance

1203
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,800
and be able to

1204
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,040
not just have those permissions but make

1205
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,359
them easy to change

1206
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,119
we want to regularly audit those

1207
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,400
permissions to make sure that we're

1208
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,319
doing the right things

1209
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,400
on the technology side

1210
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
this means that our data needs to be

1211
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,880
siloed if our people are the weakest

1212
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,760
link

1213
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,359
and we need to optimize for the number

1214
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,880
of conspirators

1215
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,680
then

1216
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,520
conway's law

1217
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,680
says that we also need to break our

1218
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,560
organization into those silos our data

1219
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,720
needs to be siloed those permissions

1220
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,800
need to be siloed and actually the

1221
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,560
natural course

1222
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,760
of apis moving towards microservices is

1223
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,119
great for this

1224
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,359
because now you can express those group

1225
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,000
level permissions and those user level

1226
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,319
permissions at the microservice

1227
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,440
granularity and that's a really natural

1228
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,319
fit for the databases then that live

1229
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,319
behind that microservice

1230
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,599
or the permissions that the team in that

1231
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,319
area and the data that that team should

1232
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,680
should really have

1233
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,598
to uh to be able to access

1234
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,839
we can then optimize for the number of

1235
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,400
silos that have to be breached to carry

1236
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,319
out a successful penetration of the

1237
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,800
application

1238
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
then a couple more things very very

1239
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,920
specifically

1240
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,760
we want to keep that data close to the

1241
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,960
source so resist that urge to centralize

1242
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,640
everything in one place like yes a10

1243
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,200
says that you want to have centralized

1244
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,359
data collection but what they really

1245
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,040
mean is that

1246
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
the data shouldn't be stored on the host

1247
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,040
where an attacker who's exploiting that

1248
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,920
host

1249
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,000
can delete all the logs

1250
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,560
you want to create a centralized

1251
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,440
database for those logs within every

1252
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,240
microservice environment so that it's

1253
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,560
not enough just to exploit a host you

1254
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,800
have to exploit the whole silo

1255
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,400
but at the same time you want to keep

1256
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,000
that data close to where it was

1257
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,480
generated close to the api that

1258
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,960
generated it

1259
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,359
part of gdpr and ccpa we can then roll

1260
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,000
that data off automatically expire that

1261
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,520
data when we need when we don't need to

1262
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,480
have it anymore we can monitor actively

1263
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,280
pii transfer

1264
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,160
and we can also virtualize access to raw

1265
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,440
data

1266
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,280
so that's the potential

1267
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,200
there's so much that we could be doing

1268
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,960
around day 10

1269
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,280
but in order to really solve for a 10 we

1270
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,599
have to also solve for for some of these

1271
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,560
privacy and pii concerns we really can

1272
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,720
go from a place where we don't really

1273
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,960
feel like we're having a great time

1274
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,200
to a place where we really feel like we

1275
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,520
are understanding how our apis are being

1276
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,079
used and how they're being exploited

1277
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,319
and and we can we can sleep well at

1278
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,319
night

1279
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,599
thank you so much for having me here
