1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,120
[Music]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,160
um

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,160
yeah the title is already clear so

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,040
that's

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,200
one step ahead graham

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,519
gary was kindly enough to introduce me

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,320
uh

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
extensively so what does it talk about

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
it's about two things and i think people

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
forget about it i always see that there

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
are two cameras like the developers and

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,920
the security people but actually there

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
are two very important things

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,000
one is

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,199
code what is software we have to realize

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,280
that these days and i always jokingly

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
say the 27 year old senior full stack

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,520
developer

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
she or he

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,520
will consider everything to be code that

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
she or he can

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
send a commit to a source code

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
repository or git lab or hub whatever

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,200
you have

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
it will be considered as code

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
so another thing is responsibilities are

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
the key word in my talk and it's about

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
who is responsible for the code because

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
isn't it really weird that security

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
becomes kind of responsible for the

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,440
security to talk what you're doing and

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
as i always say suffer secure people

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
you don't do security when you look at

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,320
it you don't do security when you look

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,119
at a

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,520
guard at a museum or

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,839
art

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
exposure

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
they are doing security because they're

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
securing the artifacts they are

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
protecting right like a bodyguard yeah

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
that's very security job

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,840
but do we protect anything we will no we

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
don't you hack you show vulnerabilities

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,920
but you're not secure

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
but i'm already going ahead of my

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
presentation so let's take a step back

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
and say what does coding actually mean

49
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,520
what is what has changed and you know

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
what to do today and why you're doing it

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,399
but always have to know where to do

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,960
something let's have a step back on how

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,799
it comes we do the things

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,840
so

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
first of all

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,560
software development started early last

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
century right

58
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,920
and the first developers we know that

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
women were not males because we were

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
fighting they were fighting luckily i

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
had ever had to fight so the male were

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
fighting and women wrote the first code

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
and not much change because you need

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
some kind of requirements then you need

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
some kind of design i know yes therefore

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
you don't have items but you still have

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
it whatever you call it

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
and then we do implementation we do

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
verification and then it has to be

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
maintained right there's nothing changed

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
and even in such a

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
young area of shock you cannot explain

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,280
much expect much to change what it does

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
it has to be structured because when you

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
have repeat a process

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,879
it has to be structured so you can

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
measure success and quality because

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
that's the difference

79
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
when you did a

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
coding in university or your hobby

81
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
project it's all nice but now you are

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
the developers are enterprise developers

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
right you can do it for business

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
in professional encoder you need

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
professional quality code

86
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
so the first process of the first one

87
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
but the most known

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,959
and i think

89
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,280
good and bad yes actually has been

90
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
waterfall very cascaded

91
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
the requirements of the the artifacts of

92
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,760
different steps

93
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
down to the final maintenance as

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
documentation right when you ever had a

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
question in the steps below design you

96
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,879
couldn't get back out because there was

97
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,120
no people closing yes i know that later

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,959
on they built them in i have been a

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
development contractor so when you came

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
back like oh who wrote a design

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
requirements because i have a question

102
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
they were either not available because

103
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
they worked from our team and all they

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
had always that all the thing was

105
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,319
dissolved right so in years-long

106
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,400
projects we developed code the customer

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
never wondered

108
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
it's kind of the

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
i think it's called telephone game when

110
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,239
you whisper a word from the first uh a

111
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,159
person's ear and the whisper from one to

112
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,680
the next in the end and different word

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
comes out right the same we did that

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,560
and don't forget about maintaining all

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,200
the source code so what was next was the

116
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,799
big relief of the overhead it was

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
extreme programming and that was really

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
cool because now we had

119
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,480
a circle we we went on sprints and

120
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
everything we do now is

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,159
defaults over edge or whatever you want

122
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
to call it has an origin in extreme

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,839
programming because that just to purpose

124
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,759
build just purpose build trust and time

125
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
but when you start building

126
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
more complex things first don't start

127
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
with the easy things start with the hard

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
things because then you know

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
they will have problems

130
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
the next thing is also then you had this

131
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
user values and user details right

132
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
simple design

133
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,479
and even the refactoring right the

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
default was very in charge

135
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
and actually developers and testers

136
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
became friends because now we had peer

137
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
programming so we looked together behind

138
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,880
one keyboard and always hated them and

139
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
somebody had touched my keyboard but now

140
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
you together made the software better

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
that was two problems in this

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
one problem is

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
business was not involved

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
in the second and i don't know if it's

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,000
maybe the bigger or lesser problem was

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,639
that actually operation was not involved

147
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,960
so the testers and the farmers became

148
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
friends they built some software and

149
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,919
they released it to the maintenance to

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
the opera ops guys and they were like

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,919
what did we get now because they were

152
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,360
not involved

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,199
and i said the business was involved so

154
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,880
now we have to add childish brands and

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,560
said okay time and money is uh bound but

156
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
functionality is flexible but you

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
couldn't sell that to business because

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,479
they didn't understand

159
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,039
the next logic step was then

160
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,280
to extreme program and devops was

161
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,120
actually over the sign of agileness csgd

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,759
and then to come to devops and it's very

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
important to highlight

164
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
the focus on agile being on the process

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
because now we had a standardized

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
process and chinese we have other

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
flexness but we have to be highlighting

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,880
on changes we have accelerated delivery

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
whereby cicd now because we did some

170
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
things repeatedly from receipt probably

171
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
we did it over and over again like hey i

172
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
don't do it more than once i do it twice

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,680
to do it more than that i can automate

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
it so software defined life cycles

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
because highlighting the tools and

176
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
emphasis or automation remove

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,919
the human failure

178
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,080
and the last step then when you come in

179
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
together and i know the people use it in

180
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
the change of belief but it should not

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
is a devops part now you focus on the

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
culture and what's very important you

183
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
highlight on the roles because who is

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
responsible and

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
on the emphasis on responsiveness

186
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
because everything that is to the gay

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
can be changed tomorrow the technology

188
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
can be also then also security and i

189
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
will come back to that later on

190
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,000
so

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
with staffs like ops why have you say

192
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
devops are not deaf seconds and that's

193
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,360
very interesting why is there a second

194
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
option i think and i was one of those

195
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
who didn't believe in pathways i don't

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
remember many years back dennis cruz

197
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,160
said

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
make security transparent for developers

199
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,560
i was like oh no they have to be aware

200
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
you know just

201
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
you have to put a face on it you have to

202
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,960
learn but actually i

203
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
have to admit dennis was right but he

204
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
was many years ahead of mine

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,280
so he said and the same is here with

206
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
staff obsessed we call it death seconds

207
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
just to put an emphasis on the security

208
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
but it's not there to be there because

209
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,639
people should do the right work and i

210
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
think that's very important

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
we as security people say oh this is a

212
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
high-risk application now we need more

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,080
security

214
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,039
you know

215
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
the standard way how we write software

216
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
should be the security

217
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
what is the difference is the

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,240
amount of verification it is secure

219
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,400
depending on the criticality of the

220
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
application right and i think this is

221
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
also wrong

222
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
because it's there's a way how we write

223
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
code there's a way how we connect to the

224
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
database and we know everybody in the

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
security and the most developer know yes

226
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,400
you should not do string calculations

227
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
too great and a

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,639
query string

229
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
but then what should you do and you

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
should always do it the right way right

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
and this way we have frameworks and

232
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,919
libraries but let's go back and what is

233
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
definitions so one is the tools and we

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,560
have various tools that we can use in

235
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
the first tool i say when you can use

236
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
tool know that

237
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
before you write one line of code

238
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
because you have to set it up first

239
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,560
right

240
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,639
and this stage is all this configuration

241
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
files that are seen as codes at the

242
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,919
moment you have your build configuration

243
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
with your build pipeline you have your

244
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
dependencies in there already we know

245
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
which server you're talking to you can

246
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,519
use static application security testing

247
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
and that's not one way we do it it's not

248
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,880
just by commit or just by nightly build

249
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
there must be a graduation on testing

250
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
because well i always compared when i

251
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
was a developer social development by

252
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
writing a story writing a book when you

253
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
write a book you don't wait the whole

254
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
book to be finished before you

255
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
take care of the spelling errors right

256
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,959
your favorite text editor has

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,320
functionalities

258
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,279
file based or even line based sentence

259
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
based do i do anything wrong with the

260
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,680
grammar do i have my word have spending

261
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,200
mistakes

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
we have this with compiler errors for

263
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
your feedback from the ide and do we

264
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
have any grammar mistakes and that's

265
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
already on final base we can look are

266
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
there any untrusted or unsecured

267
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
functions used

268
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
so on the ide it's not a full scan it's

269
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
just high level but it's

270
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,839
quick feedback as we write

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,560
on a file level security the first level

272
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
and then maybe when you check it in when

273
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
you commit it you have this copy break

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
uh check right let's check it in i get

275
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
some coffee i come back i want to have

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
some results it's just another level on

277
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,160
commit level

278
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,080
uh scan when you do not a full team but

279
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,560
it's just an incremental scan a small

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
scandancy is anything wrong in the

281
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,080
context i just submit

282
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
and then of course when it's unveiled

283
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
then you have the more in depth maybe

284
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,120
days

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
taking scans depending on your

286
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,399
complexity of your source code but so

287
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
there's no one way to do it in several

288
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,680
ways

289
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
but it's only

290
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
the static application key testing the

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
next step of course you can already

292
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
grade is the software composition

293
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,959
analysis it becomes more and more

294
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,320
important as it became almost uh top 10

295
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
i think a9 it was in 2017 and he said

296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,800
the usage of known unsecured dependency

297
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
in libraries right we know these days

298
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,440
which might only 10 to 15 i think on max

299
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
of the source code ourselves but a

300
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,279
source code comes from somewhere and

301
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
actually what you know what

302
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
other people throw the other software

303
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,800
even your

304
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
java or the net framework your php

305
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
framework has been written by people and

306
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
therefore there might be errors in there

307
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
the software composition analysis helps

308
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,760
you what to find them

309
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
and yes of course that always has a

310
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
really good tool it's the lowest levels

311
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
like hey is there anything known and

312
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,760
against this version in the nvidia in a

313
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
natural vulnerability database

314
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
so it's just something you don't have to

315
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
think do i have to do it well just do it

316
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
because it's there and that's what about

317
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
tools that's why you integrate tools in

318
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
your pipeline and that's the most

319
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,079
important thing of the tools to be

320
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,640
integratable but then it doesn't finish

321
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
there the next step is the dynamic

322
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,399
testing because we can look at all the

323
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,800
source code because i said everything

324
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
that is in your context is source code

325
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
it's your dependencies your build files

326
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,079
is your

327
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,839
uh configuration files on your

328
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,399
kubernetes or in the container

329
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
everything can be seen as source code so

330
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,040
is there any secret in there but then we

331
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
only know there's an aesthetic range

332
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,079
that means that on the dynamic

333
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,920
vulnerability it has to do predictions

334
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
and yeah we know it's

335
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,120
everything's easy to predict except the

336
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
future so you don't know how it really

337
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
responds when it's in the dynamic

338
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
runtime so that's where you have to ask

339
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
for

340
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
these days i hear people ah forget about

341
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
stars and dance

342
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
is the holy grail but really

343
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,639
really

344
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,760
because in dust we see everything that

345
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
we can think about in the skill

346
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
and the same for ies because you only

347
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
can use ios and every of course security

348
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
testing is based on quality when you

349
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
have tests

350
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,920
in place

351
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
you have a complete test set and a

352
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
comprehensive tester and we are humans

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,279
we never have everything full

354
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,560
comprehensive right so sas gives you two

355
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
whole negative truths about your

356
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,720
software but then is it relevant in the

357
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,279
dynamic context where the dynamic looks

358
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
from the outside do we can we figure out

359
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,000
any functionality that has to be

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
exploited and then is is another level

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
of increasing security where you have

362
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,639
your tests running and you're monitoring

363
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,959
what is happening in the air

364
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,720
you never should ask yourself if you use

365
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
one or the other you should have a

366
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
holistic motion analytics application of

367
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
course you don't do it full blown for

368
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,079
every application when you do it by hand

369
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
but as i said there is not the one

370
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
application has to be secured the other

371
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,200
hasn't

372
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
it's about

373
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
we have to write secure software

374
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
the level of

375
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
verification has changed

376
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
but now verification when you automate

377
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
it it becomes cheap and therefore

378
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
why why should i do it it's already in

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
place it's just to hook up the tools so

380
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,040
let's say that's actually comes our

381
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
security champion right everybody has a

382
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,720
very uh

383
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
highlighting a role so somebody must be

384
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
in uh responsible for security and in a

385
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
team it must be the security champion

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,839
but there have been many mistakes made

387
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,920
and i think we still do mistakes on when

388
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,639
we address the functionality or the

389
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
uh responsibilities of the securi

390
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
champions but first i want to highlight

391
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,120
some points that go wrong when we talk

392
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
about death saga and i think most of

393
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
those are caused by the security people

394
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,519
first of all

395
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
the number of fte resources right when

396
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,639
you need someone dedicated because these

397
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,000
days i see

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
it's not difficult buying

399
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
those tools it's security security is

400
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,480
actually having the money and they're

401
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
buying the tools to verify the security

402
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,880
of that what the developer builds

403
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,199
so the security is more fda to maintain

404
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,079
it

405
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
and then of course we have more

406
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,079
complexity so we at complexity we the

407
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,600
skill we want to them the developers

408
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,399
work

409
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,680
and they don't see the benefits they

410
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,199
only see when they get hit by the

411
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,720
security state

412
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,880
isn't that real and then

413
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,279
30 people that get kpis by finding their

414
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
vulnerabilities

415
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,199
so they're offloading responsibility to

416
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,959
securities developers say oh you have to

417
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,639
integrate this

418
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,240
and then they get hit by a number of

419
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
vulnerabilities because that's where

420
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,040
they find it and then all the modern

421
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,639
involvement of qualification you have to

422
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,480
do over again because you do like once a

423
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
half year once a year right and then

424
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
what's about the third party software

425
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,760
you have another tool fender you have to

426
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
maintain

427
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
and of course a toolbar functionality

428
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,639
and technology it's cumbersome

429
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,600
so let's see how then impacted it goes

430
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,399
wrong

431
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
what i saw in my long time as a

432
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
consultant is first as

433
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,360
every role is there right and we have

434
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
devops but doesn't anything change no

435
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,639
because

436
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
when we said it's a team responsible in

437
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
therefore havoc has a really really

438
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,120
important thing with a big change has

439
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
now has a team from gradual to great

440
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,240
responsibility of a project

441
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,079
it's not that in the past when you had a

442
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,160
project team that either creates a new

443
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,560
application or adds a new functionality

444
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,240
to an existing application now we have a

445
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
smaller team who has one or more

446
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
applications they maintain they know it

447
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
from inside out and that's their work

448
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,560
right don't get looking for until this

449
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
project ceased to exist

450
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
but they are one team

451
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
and the securities outside the team

452
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,160
and i have heard and i really get so

453
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
tired of it so many talks even today in

454
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,880
this conference when we say the

455
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,040
developers

456
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
if that's as long as they're a day and

457
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
them on us

458
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,440
it never will be

459
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,399
really a team effort so that's so

460
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,440
wonderful

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
so

462
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
business has money assigned some work so

463
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,079
it has to be something has been done

464
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,959
so

465
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,440
the dev team uh build devops team builds

466
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
and deploys the school new feature of

467
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
extension

468
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
security finds out about it

469
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,519
by accident and they hack it break it

470
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
and then play oops my security guy is

471
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,920
gone they blame uh

472
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
it by the security report and

473
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
requirements that definitely never heard

474
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
about because it's maintained by the

475
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,959
security right so we go with this you

476
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,560
report say hey

477
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,279
dear business look they haven't

478
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,160
been complying to our security policies

479
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
you have to stop this but the business

480
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
can see only one thing they have to

481
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,320
accept the risk because wait a minute

482
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,959
from the minister to know in the past

483
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
security became a ministerius flow so

484
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
now suddenly the deaf team has to wait

485
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,360
three weeks a month or two months for

486
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
security results to come in

487
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
by that time business cannot wait three

488
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
weeks so development becomes agile

489
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,279
and security is leaking behind

490
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
barely can keep up

491
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,399
so and then of course hey we have our

492
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
security bill let him do the validation

493
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
because we have this equilibrium are

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,480
much important we are much too

495
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,439
bright let the developing uh uh solve it

496
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,359
so we that's what i meant shifting off

497
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
responsibilities to the security

498
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
champion good luck if you want to

499
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,400
discourage anybody is by offloading only

500
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
the street jobs sorry for my apartment

501
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
french of your job that will not work

502
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,839
but this is how it should not be done

503
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,280
and let's look at the price right now

504
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,400
yeah we have

505
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,280
some time left that's the positive thing

506
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
so what you need to solve is you need

507
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
one unified dashboard when we talk about

508
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,400
the same thing we need one few of the

509
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
truths and it should have like

510
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
more capabilities

511
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
kind of a risk mentioning

512
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,880
abilities and it should be a kind of

513
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
a software asset management because you

514
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,240
need everything in there you should have

515
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,960
to

516
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,520
add my software as integration

517
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,480
automation and we should do the kpis for

518
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
both tips developer and security for

519
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,039
time to fix so the quicker they are the

520
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,120
easier it is we should have availability

521
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
management that looks at trends because

522
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
i don't care if my application has one

523
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
or two escrow injections there is

524
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,720
something wrong we have to change it by

525
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,039
not by patching this problem so fixing

526
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,919
the symptoms but have to have

527
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,440
architectural proven solutions right

528
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,679
so now we have the same thing

529
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,160
but we have to make it one team that

530
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
means one central dashboard everything

531
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
you can benefit from

532
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
oops there's something wrong with the

533
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
slides so first thing is who owns the

534
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,000
this application who owns this one

535
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
dashboard

536
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,200
as i said

537
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,360
security has the money so they own it

538
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,400
and they

539
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,440
maintain it but cannon have no ability

540
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,360
to maintain and run an application it's

541
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,480
the developing who's actually is they're

542
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
living and then understanding to

543
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,799
maintain an application that they should

544
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,880
do it yes the

545
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
security should be the sponsor but not

546
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,320
the owner of the application right

547
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,960
they maintain it and operate it

548
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
they build in uh do the devops thing so

549
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
therefore this actually this way comes

550
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
the tried of the security champions

551
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,000
right in default we have our tribes or

552
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
how you want to call it and the drive

553
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
security champions should maintain the

554
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
availability of spot and there are those

555
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
who make sure that it's automation not

556
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,679
to securely put it up on them we give

557
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
the tools to them and say let's do it

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,919
you should do it right it's your tool

559
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,320
it's not our tool we are the sponsor of

560
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
it

561
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
the next thing is then because it's

562
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,720
there it's one unified dashboard we put

563
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
in security requirements there for the c

564
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,799
and this should not be this high levels

565
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
energy you should not have a square on

566
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
text now we can have for example the hvs

567
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,240
based on the type of application it's a

568
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,840
front-end java application it's a

569
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
back-end.net application it's an sql

570
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
it's whatever we can have a subset of

571
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,120
our requirements default automated for

572
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
example our projects

573
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
uh the security red the requirement

574
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
automation tool is helping you in this

575
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
so one dashboard with one requirement

576
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,799
set depending on publications when this

577
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,880
your champion

578
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
creates this approach you can say okay

579
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
it's a backend application using java

580
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,760
hasn't done that a has a sql injection

581
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
as well database and we have no frontend

582
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
or we have whatever yeah so

583
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
to the point requirements readable

584
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,280
then the executions are responsible for

585
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
indicating all those tools in it because

586
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
it's only default it's their ownership

587
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
so they will make sure that they can do

588
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
it and they can exchange on how to do it

589
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,679
better

590
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,280
yeah because you repeat it it becomes

591
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,159
better

592
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,960
and then of course your team has to do

593
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,799
that can now focus that what they are

594
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,960
good and using the human brain and

595
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
intellect to do the multi-level

596
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,760
functional vulnerabilities because don't

597
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,039
forget it

598
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,640
a tool only can find technical errors no

599
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
flaws because the tool will always

600
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,039
assume it's built as it should be

601
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
so what is the benefit the benefits is

602
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,960
the way the team has early feedback they

603
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,559
have ownership control and get a

604
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,000
feedback

605
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
and the role changes from security from

606
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
becoming the one who bash with the

607
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
security stick

608
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,480
is becoming a mentor and monitor so

609
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,840
you're more into the brokers of the

610
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,799
teams

611
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,559
and you're mentoring them that means

612
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
when you see for example a certain race

613
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,559
in the trends of

614
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,320
tapping epic

615
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
you can ask those security champions who

616
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
have this problem like hey guys what

617
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,919
changed in your project that we have to

618
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,640
sum the disgrace in numbers they come

619
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,159
together maybe it was an update on the

620
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,120
front

621
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,760
and template engine right so they can

622
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
look what was important what caused this

623
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
race and they can then spread the

624
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,960
knowledge over their teams and can

625
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,400
prevent it

626
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,559
that is really much better to work on

627
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,039
trends than making total numbers it also

628
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,679
means that now your security the sizer

629
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,440
will be happy because he can say we

630
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,760
don't need this annual training it's a

631
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,080
waste of time how many times i've seen

632
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,360
this that you do a php based security

633
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
training

634
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,559
for travel developers or

635
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,720
for python training developers doing

636
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
trauma trading it will not help just

637
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,799
waste one week of time what you want to

638
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,159
have it's like hey there's a security

639
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,480
issue coming up and you do on the case

640
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
trading but you also can do like for

641
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
always skf

642
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,760
hey you need functionality in your

643
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
sprint and it's maybe also something for

644
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
this dashboard you create a file upload

645
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
and you have you if you have certain

646
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,440
availabilities and you get a training to

647
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,960
the appointment that interests you or

648
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
training to the functionality you're

649
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
developing right so we have much more

650
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
training but it spends less time because

651
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
it's not an offside one week training

652
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
but it's a instant maybe five min 15

653
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,679
minutes half an hour training to the

654
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,159
what you need because you don't remember

655
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,080
when you learn something about stuff you

656
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
don't need

657
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,679
and of course our business will be good

658
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,679
because the businesses will still start

659
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,240
yeah that means that you are now in

660
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
desert or have a holistic view of

661
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
application

662
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
it's ownership by the developer

663
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
and i hear many times the available

664
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,520
don't want the right secure code this is

665
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
 i don't believe that

666
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,039
and of course it's you make them

667
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,919
responsible and if they're good

668
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,520
of course craftmans but you need

669
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
craftsmanship

670
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
and craftsmanship

671
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
cares about what he created he or she so

672
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,799
what you need is craftsmanship

673
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,919
accountability you have the

674
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,600
responsibility but you also have to give

675
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
them that ability

676
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
and when you give them the tools and you

677
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,360
see the teams good you let the reigns go

678
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
a bit because you know their trust

679
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,080
properly and those who are less to trust

680
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,520
you pull the drains on it's like hey

681
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
guys this is not working

682
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
i will have a big eye to you so this is

683
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
the game you have here but the first

684
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,080
thing is you have to be part of them and

685
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
you have to be integrated

686
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,880
so one thing we left out so far it's

687
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,679
on the right side is the responsiveness

688
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,159
i see all everybody looks at the inside

689
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,240
because all software development so we

690
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
need the

691
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,159
the life cycle but we forget

692
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,559
now we step they're responsible of the

693
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
whole uh battle to create a life-size

694
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
application so also the tools also in

695
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,080
tools for example we have to verify what

696
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
is under production

697
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
this is another chance where

698
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,400
our security guy is the mentor

699
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,480
and mentor and the application ideas

700
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,440
security i mean has to be then that

701
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,400
those who um overrated and be in the

702
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
chat uh being the connection right and

703
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,400
of course for everything the connection

704
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440
should be

705
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
yes this one dashboard i really hope it

706
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,360
will go out i have some really good

707
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
tools also coming up with the in

708
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,880
creating the risk but you still didn't

709
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,919
want to

710
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,679
you know the most software and i worked

711
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,039
for different houses when you're a

712
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,200
company it's not the only software you

713
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,559
build but it's also the software you

714
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,919
want when you're more than one company

715
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,279
we have the employment graduation uh

716
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,880
applications you have your text here if

717
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
your hr

718
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
there's all external software you want

719
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,279
to test and your dashboard has to be a

720
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
holistic place of use you can software

721
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
assessment

722
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
a software uh

723
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
uh

724
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
portfolio you have because whenever

725
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
something comes up from

726
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
a responsible disclosure to an ocean

727
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,679
application alerts you you need to know

728
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,400
where it is is it still running and who

729
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
is responsible to fix it

730
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,679
we all have seen that when the business

731
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,880
you ask them hey what is your

732
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
30 inaudible likely don't exist anymore

733
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,559
and 40 who are already up and running

734
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,799
are not almost live right so you need

735
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,840
one

736
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,159
dashboard with live updated and you need

737
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,400
to know responsibility so change

738
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
responsibility

739
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
our tools should be developer tools even

740
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,440
to the developers they have to operate

741
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
it that gives you the head off you don't

742
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
have to do stuff you're not good at for

743
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
example over maintain a dashboard

744
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
and you have can focus on the real

745
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,080
important stuff and one thing will shift

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
in our time as long

747
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,919
i will not want to see any tool monkeys

748
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
anymore in this area or the next five

749
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
years because every tool we can automate

750
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
i want you as security people to use

751
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,880
your brains to mentor and become friends

752
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,799
with developers

753
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
i think my time is up

754
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
thanks for listening to me i hope it

755
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,279
helps to give you some insights

756
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,559
gary how are you doing
