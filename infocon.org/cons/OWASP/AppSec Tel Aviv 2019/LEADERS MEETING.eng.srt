1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,660
mobile apps at Tel Aviv 20:19 leaders

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:13,620
meeting we're probably going to keep

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,910
this relatively short we're gonna keep

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,189
this relatively short so that you can

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,380
actually have time to ask any questions

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,970
that you have at the end and then get to

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,000
the important stuff which of course we

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:30,810
all know is the food and the drinks our

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,809
Heights all right for tonight is the

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,149
foundation update the chapters update

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:42,809
projects I've gained the events and the

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:46,039
operational update the first thing to

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:51,539
note is that I don't know who is at the

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:55,170
last global app set but there you go

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,120
perfect one two three four okay but

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,930
we've got a slightly different staff

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,578
than we did last time

18
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,760
some of you if not most of you might

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:12,930
know the interim executive director he

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:15,070
came on board January 2nd it's Mike

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,150
McKinnon he's in the back

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,149
[Music]

23
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:26,479
you all know me probably I've only been

24
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:33,680
here for a year so it's not like I've

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:35,509
been here for a very long time so also

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,630
in the back is our events directory

27
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:42,310
director Emily Berman she came on board

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,310
just what this month right

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,470
we're expecting really great things

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,470
[Laughter]

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,550
that's right and our senior manager

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,360
sponsorship and membership she is also

33
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:09,258
here tonight

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:10,870
Kelly Santa Lucia and if you are a

35
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:15,109
leader and not a member

36
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:16,880
first of all shame and second of all

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,980
she's back here in the corner if you

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,390
want to talk to her not here tonight is

39
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,200
our community manager but you probably

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:30,200
all know her Don akin she mostly deals

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,200
with chapters so if you're a chapters

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,100
here you know very well spend a lot of

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,380
time our project the sponsorship manager

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,940
is Lisa Jones she's also not here

45
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,170
tonight and finally we have an

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,790
accounting firm if you will it takes

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,500
care of our accounting those are the

48
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,209
people whenever you put in the jury

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:03:01,160
tickets it goes to them just pay you

50
00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:02,840
okay here's our Olas Foundation board

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,329
that recently changed as well we have

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,940
three these are three new members three

53
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,910
right so first and foremost is our

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,880
chairman Martin Knobloch he's been here

55
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,370
quite some time

56
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,440
[Applause]

57
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,040
one pillow Pendlebury who could not be

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,829
here you go vice chairman Sharif Mansoor

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,780
he's our treasurer if you get a chance

60
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,220
to go to the open security summit you'll

61
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,860
get to meet him you'll be at the open

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,609
security summit after this it's right

63
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:37,380
after this that our secretaries

64
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:43,860
alpha-male our isn't a new board member

65
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:46,660
[Applause]

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,340
and then we have our three members at

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,530
large that's Qin Zi Wang she could not

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:56,980
be here Richard Greenberg who is right

69
00:03:50,530 --> 00:04:10,450
here and Garry Robinson who also could

70
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:13,359
not be here okay so the current theme

71
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:18,370
for the Olas foundation staff is to

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,530
simplify unify and grow and I don't

73
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,330
think the last two are going to be that

74
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,099
easy without the first one one of the

75
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:29,190
biggest problems we have as a staff is

76
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,190
that all of our welcome Tania

77
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,890
one of our problems is that a lot of our

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,090
processes are a little bit convoluted

79
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,310
most of you probably are aware of this

80
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,150
so one of our biggest things we need to

81
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,050
do is reduce the complexity of the

82
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:50,049
processes so that we can advance the

83
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,910
mission of the foundation next and you'd

84
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,169
have to say equally as important is to

85
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:58,510
unify the community have us all moving

86
00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:02,650
toward you know 100 us if you remember

87
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:06,659
that from the previous ab SEC our our

88
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,310
goal is 100 us that's right

89
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,210
[Laughter]

90
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,210
state the obvious thank you

91
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,380
and last is of course once we can

92
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,540
simplify and unify then we can grow the

93
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,340
foundation to move forward and create

94
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,850
these big events that Emily is going to

95
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,849
be moving us toward right thank you

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,330
so the future directions revived the

97
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,460
chapter and project committees which was

98
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,590
Richard's help and the help of Andrew

99
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,719
van der stadt we were able to say the

100
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,590
project committee will be ramping up

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,180
here shortly and with the project

102
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,919
committee we're really hoping to be able

103
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:53,080
to move quicker unlike for instance

104
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,270
project reviews right now the project

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,000
reviews are done at these apps like

106
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,859
events the reason for that is because

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
it's really the only time we have where

108
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,750
we can get enough project people

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,820
together to get the reviews done and if

110
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:27,940
we had a project committee we could

111
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:30,690
certainly do that to try to start out

112
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,790
with some other key such as chapter

113
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,350
it doesn't very importantly maybe

114
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,270
community to assistance never need

115
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,760
marketing there's variety of others that

116
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,599
you could look towards start it up but

117
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,219
you can't please tell your chapters that

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,650
we're looking for volunteers to start up

119
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,450
committees and I know we have committees

120
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,400
to point out of document on the wiki

121
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,380
that will help you that will guide you

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,280
through it I know it did seem like it

123
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,550
could be a lot with it what you did the

124
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,890
foundation step and assisted questions

125
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,380
really really won some help because you

126
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,650
have limited staff and limited board

127
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,980
members and committees vary over many

128
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,979
many years

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,409
thank you that's another example of that

130
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,030
when it comes to projects and I speak

131
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,300
projects because that's near and dear to

132
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,799
me one of the things we talked about the

133
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,510
previous app second that we've been

134
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
wanting to move forward our project

135
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,289
services for instance the ability to

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,500
have a place where the project leaders

137
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,530
we've done it to say they need a GUI

138
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,200
person they need translation they need

139
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,239
documentation anything like that you'd

140
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,610
have a place where the pressure should

141
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,620
go to get people to help them with that

142
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,000
and right now we haven't been able to do

143
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,000
that which we had a project committee

144
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:57,960
we'd have a lot more people being able

145
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,330
to push that forward so among the other

146
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,599
things that were working on some of the

147
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,900
staff projects that we have

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:12,130
is the website I don't know how many of

149
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:14,489
you actually read the blog but I talk

150
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:18,159
specifically about moving the website

151
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,660
making more modern website putting it in

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:26,200
the gift of into actually whenever

153
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:29,980
looking at and we think that will

154
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,280
actually help from both the foundation

155
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:37,030
outside of normal though us people were

156
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,539
used to right I mean used to it we see

157
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:43,539
it but if if other than that disorder

158
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,030
when his sixteen-year-old daughter went

159
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,219
and looked at the website and one point

160
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:54,480
she was like is this a real business

161
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,040
right so

162
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,530
we don't want people going there and

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,719
thinking that most people in security -

164
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,310
no - or lost is we want to know what

165
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,210
those people who aren't part of security

166
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:11,500
who might be just starting up to go OS

167
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:15,580
is real and our current presence doesn't

168
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:18,210
say that so we're looking for help as

169
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,390
well in the website right now we've got

170
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,780
Ken who is with get up he's gonna help

171
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,939
us

172
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:36,250
Andra has volunteered to help us thank

173
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:37,600
you up Jonathan Martin and so thank you

174
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,730
so we're going to be looking to move

175
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,910
that forward within the next month or

176
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,410
two

177
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,130
right hopefully the next month right

178
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,130
Mike yes

179
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,689
some of the other things we're looking

180
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:55,859
at or changes to the corporate

181
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,839
sponsorship you'll see more about that

182
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,560
later as we as we sit down in

183
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:04,230
communication working to revise the

184
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,750
policies in the leaders handbooks and

185
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:11,500
what that means for you right now is

186
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,750
just that we're trying to coalesce what

187
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,040
its policy and take them out of the

188
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,140
leader handbooks for instance because

189
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,120
they both reference similar things but

190
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,920
separately if you know what I mean

191
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,410
whereas we want to be able to say if

192
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,079
their policy for a spinning policy is is

193
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,370
in one place project leaders chapter

194
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:54,849
leaders don't matter anymore it's the

195
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:58,570
same place to go look and see the trying

196
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:15,190
to make a career three events four

197
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:17,459
events much more speculative at this

198
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,459
point

199
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,670
the challenge is that if you're an

200
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:35,480
American one I'm sorry two out of every

201
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,849
ten Americans have a passport which

202
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,900
means a --it Americans do not they

203
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,360
wouldn't they would not travel the

204
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:46,760
candidate even though it's that close

205
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:48,230
and so the logic aside so that we

206
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,850
haven't made a decision yet when we were

207
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,700
looking at Canada that the reason why we

208
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,530
were thinking that may not work is for

209
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,390
that reason that it would deter

210
00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:02,270
Americans to go unless there's a big

211
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:04,189
rush to get past once it's it's it's not

212
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,960
it's not the good old Americans the new

213
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,670
America yes you have to have a passport

214
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,670
to come back into the States

215
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:25,579
[Applause]

216
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:39,470
after that argument though we after that

217
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:40,610
argument at least from the American

218
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,910
perspective account for that

219
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:48,940
argumentative we work in tech their

220
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,939
viewers not like where

221
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,330
anyone on staff because we're talking

222
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,850
about this right now but the one thing

223
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,800
that we are going to do mine Emily and I

224
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,970
have talked about it a lot is we want to

225
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,490
make sure that we're training the next

226
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,530
two and three years out we don't want to

227
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,640
do this like six weeks out if we decide

228
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:25,079
to have a conference kind of a thing

229
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,710
because it's insane for everybody I

230
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,480
think it will help us get better

231
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,610
speakers I think I would get us better

232
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,890
keynotes and help grow the attendance

233
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,260
saucers sponsors all of those things

234
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,660
help if people get a long period of time

235
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,819
for notice so we are that's one thing we

236
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,990
are we are certain where the events

237
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,620
actually happened is still in the

238
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:47,020
discussion but the the commitment to

239
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,490
having a long term plan is absolutely

240
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,710
within your turn

241
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,670
it's obviously even if we don't do

242
00:13:50,710 --> 00:14:00,400
Canada next year we start now talk about

243
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:03,370
2020 moving forward the chapter a baby

244
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:09,310
of a total number of chapters of 262

245
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:19,320
that has increased by 2019 that is

246
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:21,849
actually inspired this meeting the

247
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,770
layout there which you cannot probably

248
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,480
read it just basically says United

249
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,900
States and the first one that is Europe

250
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Asia Pacific Middle East Latin America

251
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:39,230
Africa Canada Caribbean and in

252
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:41,750
in chapters dolls not here but I think I

253
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:46,250
can argue that probably there was some

254
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:56,329
of the biggest growth in chapters has

255
00:14:46,250 --> 00:15:05,300
been in the Middle East Asia Pacific

256
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:08,769
been - where's that - there we go this

257
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:11,300
is a chart that shows there a specific

258
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,790
the same things the previous one that's

259
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,339
slightly different showing that Europe

260
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:19,519
the United States is the largest but the

261
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:24,709
biggest growth is as Mike said India for

262
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:27,440
instance so for project update we are

263
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,839
talking about reviving the project

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,089
summits as you know the most of you

265
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,889
problem is the open security summit

266
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:37,610
which is a project assignment that's not

267
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:41,690
put on by a lot specifically is coming

268
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,070
up next week and one of the things

269
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,990
that's really interesting about project

270
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,670
summits is it gives an opportunity for

271
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,740
people who are in projects project

272
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,880
leaders the project contributors it

273
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,600
gives them the opportunity to get

274
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,420
together in a single place sit down with

275
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:06,110
their peers and a single place all

276
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:09,199
together without distraction and sit in

277
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,250
and talk about the project work on the

278
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,699
profits specifically work on the project

279
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:23,070
right the most important thing it's done

280
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:24,540
it doesn't happen so this is a project

281
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,810
sometimes you get to sit with other

282
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,150
people our project computers and talk

283
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,229
about their projects collaborate with

284
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:38,660
other projects to see how they might

285
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:42,360
work together so we are going to

286
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:47,459
upcoming in 2020 we're looking at

287
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,200
reviving budget summits for possible

288
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,030
combination weather we have to decide

289
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,740
what we're going to do yet as for where

290
00:16:51,030 --> 00:17:04,649
it's going to be or how it's going to go

291
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:06,300
inside the conference's at the same time

292
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,100
as a conference like it overlaps to the

293
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,589
training or would you rather have it

294
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,469
completely set up and there's benefits

295
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,030
to doing it either way if it's separate

296
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,620
then of course it's only those three

297
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,420
days and only therefore that there's

298
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,698
nothing else going on but you have to

299
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,110
travel you know to that or you can have

300
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,400
it in conjunction with the conference

301
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,229
which means you couldn't go to the

302
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,829
training and there be other stuff going

303
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,480
on

304
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,310
but you can also go the conference to

305
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,550
and you've all had one trip but that

306
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,550
makes

307
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,170
well here's where I'm confused though

308
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:47,590
would it be like the summit and the

309
00:17:38,170 --> 00:18:22,050
training of the conference the summit

310
00:17:47,590 --> 00:18:22,050
running sometimes that's the same thing

311
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,629
where the room is if it's 50/50 or 8020

312
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,820
because it would be helpful just to know

313
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:39,490
it even then can we get a shorter

314
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:44,500
handsome who's actually going and

315
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:46,510
conferences with them to be at the same

316
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,080
time or the summer to be separate from

317
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,080
conferences

318
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:58,060
first first first let me get a show of

319
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,310
hands a people have actually been to one

320
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,419
of the projects islands by whether it

321
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,490
was like one in the past who has

322
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,990
actually been to a public summon say

323
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,600
open security summit or one of the

324
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:15,730
previous ones quick shopping who would

325
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:28,990
like to have the conference I try to

326
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:31,540
summon separate from there's not like an

327
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,220
overwhelmingly view of India so and

328
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,710
that's what I want to do that then I

329
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,410
guess the option an offer is what we

330
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,230
have right now where they're back to

331
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,170
back because the only reason I was able

332
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:48,280
to come to the conference is because

333
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:52,140
it's right before the sign it sounds

334
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,139
like a perfect opportunity for a survey

335
00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:01,000
because my travel is so expensive

336
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:18,010
combined into a single longer trip is

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:20,890
the only way I could do it heralds

338
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,210
another point for that as well but we're

339
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,550
having discussions of what it would look

340
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,560
like how similar or dissimilar will it

341
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,000
be from the open security summit do we

342
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,550
work with the people to organize that

343
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,720
summit and do we don't know yet but just

344
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,850
getting some sense of where the

345
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,080
community is is helpful and the good

346
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,969
news is is there's not like an obvious

347
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:48,520
path so we need to get this to keep

348
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:52,290
getting more feedback market summit just

349
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,290
guys in particular except

350
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,259
I won't go into the whole spiel about

351
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:26,100
how important projects on this arc is

352
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:28,279
you can read it right there excellent

353
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,809
that's actually what you just said is is

354
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,860
important when a state project

355
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:37,080
collaboration a lot of the issues that

356
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:41,008
we have with Texas we're using the same

357
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,110
information but different right would

358
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:45,210
not happen so much if projects were to

359
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,709
somehow be in the same place really to

360
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:52,769
talk about the things go hey you know

361
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:53,940
what we're working on that too right so

362
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:58,080
I've talked about the project committee

363
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,690
already so we have 100 300 projects

364
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,629
currently and well it doesn't sound like

365
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,730
many but it is actually 12 are currently

366
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:12,469
new this year and there's 14 away leader

367
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:14,970
updates that's something to say so

368
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:19,049
whenever a project is created what I do

369
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,320
is I take in you know what they are

370
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:23,810
wanting to do then I create

371
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,600
for instance and set everything up for

372
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:29,750
them and then the next step is for the

373
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,090
leader to actually go and update the

374
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,940
page to do the github get everything

375
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,860
ready that needs to be there and you all

376
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,860
see the project on the project inventory

377
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,110
until all that is done

378
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:47,719
there's no point keeping the project out

379
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:49,699
there that you're going to go to there's

380
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,820
nothing here there's there's no there's

381
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,810
nothing so it only happens when all of

382
00:22:52,820 --> 00:23:01,939
that takes place and so there are 14

383
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:04,700
projects that are almost complete let's

384
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,250
call them that there are quite a number

385
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,690
of them I would say six to seven of them

386
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,390
and I will be reaching out to you fairly

387
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:15,550
shortly to say we need to move forward

388
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,550
or we need to just drop the whole thing

389
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:28,190
right it's about six months and actually

390
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:32,709
we have if it's fair we have a number of

391
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,710
projects that are about six months

392
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,330
they're going to get in the mail from

393
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,750
usually means that they're going to

394
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,750
update

395
00:23:41,759 --> 00:24:04,019
that's I strongly suspect that they will

396
00:23:44,249 --> 00:24:06,109
actually just just a statement again is

397
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,779
it's a project that really hasn't

398
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:12,570
started as far as OS disconcert they

399
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,989
have the very bare-bones wiki pace and

400
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,619
nothing ever get up for instance and

401
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:19,789
they're just waiting

402
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:22,859
it's not about there are some projects I

403
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:24,330
put this out there gives me you feel

404
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,489
that it's wrong but there are some

405
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,468
project where six months might go by you

406
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:31,919
don't need an update to that project

407
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:34,440
there really are there's not a normal

408
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,219
especially not in security but if you're

409
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,070
a tool project or a co project you don't

410
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:42,450
have different changes documentation

411
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,439
project maybe not so much

412
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,440
it just depends

413
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,820
pay for events the left side till

414
00:24:53,419 --> 00:25:01,549
eternity hopefully you realize who are

415
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:02,299
here welcome has been really great so

416
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:09,770
far

417

420
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:22,700
that possible so we'll we'll talk about

421
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,360
whether or not we're going to extend

422
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,220
that past

423
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,379

for the papers and things

428
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,168
yes

429
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,370
the dates are thick I didn't put them on

430
00:25:51,169 --> 00:26:00,509
here but

431
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,508

00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:20,620
if you go d c-- dot global have sex

434
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:22,750
org or AMS website.org the websites are

435
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,139
online with links to the cost of papers

436
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,659
and along with the dates and information

437
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:31,418
we have this far I understand that

438
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:33,909
having two conferences basically the

439
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:36,940
same month is not really highly

440
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:39,039
desirable we're fixing that in 2020 we

441
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,279
kind of inherited this set up for this

442
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,570
year or making lemonade we're going to

443
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,279
make sure next year it didn't happen

444
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,559
that way that's why we've already picked

445
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,610
ice creams for next year so we can get

446
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:51,549
them far enough apart from one another

447
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:54,779
so this is a little challenging because

448
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,779
they're two bigs apart from each other

449
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:03,580
all right operations of they all of you

450
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:05,408
have noticed at least the second one but

451
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,090
the first one is the migration of some

452
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:09,850
high cost post even where we have a

453
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,980
service that were I'm not going to

454
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,959
mention the name

455
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,730
company but we have a certain person

456
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,950
have certain companies hosting site that

457
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,350
was really expensive for us we have

458
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,090
moved those off that hosting and place

459
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,740
them elsewhere and only the weaker it

460
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:27,720
remains on that particular O's you've

461
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,850
also completed the migration from old

462
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,210
mail server to Google Groups and you've

463
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:37,309
all been impacted by that hopefully it's

464
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,309
been a good impact

465
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:55,639
the transition of course we don't David

466
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,010
your processes better communication

467
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,059
there's service level agreements and

468
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:04,129
there that you should be seeing that you

469
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:06,770
get a update within seven to eight hours

470
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:11,390
so that you're getting that if it's just

471
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:14,870
before a conference okay maybe you

472
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,250
didn't get that 72 hours okay I just got

473
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:23,689
that out there because I know I'm going

474
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:26,320
to you that the transitions your

475
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,320
question

476
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:37,100
okay yes you can get in the California

477
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:43,190
stressed it and will make sure that you

478
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:47,830
have access in many cases it's chapters

479
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:50,090
of course that end up with accounts but

480
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,949
there are cases where projects will need

481
00:28:50,090 --> 00:29:05,780
it and so yes it's a case-by-case basis

482
00:28:51,950 --> 00:29:08,390
just ask this okay there are there are

483
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,460
two different kinds of accounts and one

484
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,190
of them cost us money and one of them

485
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,710
does not beyond and it beyond the other

486
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:19,490
we already pay right so we pay an amount

487
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,440
of quarters in anyway so our request

488
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,630
would be that if they can get your

489
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,650
beings to stay within a 40 minute time

490
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:35,330
frame then please don't request a higher

491
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:36,200
account because it costs us right

492
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,610
absolutely

493
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,610
it's required and you will get it

494
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,529
[Music]

495
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:51,490
there is but it's really the same as I

496
00:29:47,889 --> 00:30:05,340
think it's a hundred people that's what

497
00:29:51,490 --> 00:30:05,340
I would say to other people yes yes

498
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:11,049
staff upgrades don't affect you guys so

499
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:14,320
much except for that first one probably

500
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:16,840
which is all of our email addresses or

501
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,428
nawaz calm if your staff so if we're

502
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,199
talking to us and they're putting duct

503
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:24,340
work again we will still get your email

504
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,100
but just know that if you're going to

505
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:33,689
keep doing that there may come a time

506
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:36,639
when it's less likely to get to this and

507
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,440
last pass for all staff basically that

508
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:40,799
allows us to access all of our master

509
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,799
tools

510
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,730
what's the charity to here who's using

511
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,779
yes missus actually an important point

512
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:15,669
to bring up as part of the way we're

513
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:19,899
going to start doing membership and the

514
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:22,570
website probably in q3 q4 timeframe

515
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:25,149
we're gonna be aggressively trying to

516
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,408
get people to go to your meetups and the

517
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,570
reference point for that would be the

518
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:29,830
corporate amitabh account so if they

519
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,689
become a new member those be shown

520
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,519
here's all the local chapters near you

521
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,980
media and if you're not using the whole

522
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,409
bus one you will not appear and that map

523
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,049
is because you won't have an account

524
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:42,220
associated with the company so that

525
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,289
would be important to start remove

526
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,000
migrating your chapters to the corporate

527
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:47,980
meetup account when we pay for it so

528
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,570
it's free and - it allows the

529
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,220
organization to look bigger to the

530
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,899
outside world that there's a hundred

531
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,970
sixty-five place you can go and learn

532
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:56,289
about all waz at any point in time with

533
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,970
all the different chapters close to you

534
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,639
so we're going to be deepen our

535
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,679
relationship with meetup and we're going

536
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,539
to be also using as when we put people

537
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,070
who come new members to tell them to go

538
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,870
to the first places to go is go to the

539
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,129
local chapter and here's where they can

540
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:15,870
go because they'll be able to see it on

541
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:19,480
top of Mina the biggest 10 biggest

542
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,139
meetups these chapters number seven

543
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,790
right

544
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,940
[Laughter]

545
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,940
[Applause]

546
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:42,120
you will go community is that there is

547
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,470
some sense of a marquee that people do

548
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,030
want to be in charge of things and

549
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,150
that's totally cool

550
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:49,530
that's fine but you know in the day the

551
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,630
foundation needs to do what's going to

552
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,240
help grow foundation but there's little

553
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,190
resources is necessary and so if we all

554
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,460
use Meetup you know you could go to

555
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:01,710
meetup.com /throe slash Oma's and you'll

556
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,960
see a map of all the chapters around the

557
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,010
world when their next video meetings are

558
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,870
going to be in all that stuff which is

559
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,150
really handy if you're a new member to

560
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,129
the community if they have to go search

561
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,690
around on meetup trying to find it they

562
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,850
may be less likely to find cuz they not

563
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,980
even go to meet up in the first place so

564
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,810
we're just trying to provide services

565
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,730
that are relatively affordable to the

566
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:23,280
foundation to connect people that are

567
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,810
interested in a loss to you and so the

568
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,830
idea is if we do it something will pay

569
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:29,919
for to make it easy for everybody

570
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,919
[Music]

571
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:45,330
divorce 164th them use our corporate

572
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,670
media cameras or supposing they can

573
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:54,570
apply constantly moving people toward

574
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:56,760
ours almost every month if someone's

575
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,290
going to another you know security thing

576
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,690
in your area they'll find our stuff too

577
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:04,310
so there's a real benefit to market the

578
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,310
organization to that tool as well

579
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:11,570
the corporate leader came to be there

580
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:15,319
was some limitation in administrative

581
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:18,170
rights and I lose and so I decided to

582
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,230
keep my own so how about today with an

583
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:28,010
increase in staff what am i losing if I

584
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:30,110
go to the court I can answer it I can

585
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:35,480
answer the answer is nothing what you

586
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:38,090
end up doing is bas is the event

587
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,710
organizer it will and we make you a comb

588
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,440
organizer see that all the same

589
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,320
permissions that does the only thing is

590
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,179
that you don't have to pay for it

591
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,020
I really I can't think of anything else

592
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,020
that's different

593
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,279
[Music]

594
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:10,370
another important thing about Meetup if

595
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:15,549
you're a project there's no reason why

596
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:18,980
you can't use it as well right

597
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,410
so if you feel like you could use that

598
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,090
service for whatever purpose you can

599
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,089
also the question that

600
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:39,910
this is this is kind of mine my swipe it

601
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:47,560
meant to sorrow because he always put

602
00:35:39,910 --> 00:36:21,940
over something from this we have any

603
00:35:47,560 --> 00:36:24,310
questions yes for for the global at sex

604
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,590
there is not currently inform for if

605
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:30,730
we're doing a regional event we have

606
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:34,320
forms for that and don't do what we want

607
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,320
to do as far as global goes

608
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,179

[Applause]

614
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,470
what is it well it's kind of amorphous I

615
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,180
think for those people at this point

616
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:52,430
playing adventure so I know anywhere

617
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:57,580
until the most b2b readers so what was

618
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:59,200
the reception desk we 2.0 eluded

619
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:03,830
guidelines

620
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:09,739
policy actually has been involving an

621
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:15,690
average people mostly mostly

622
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:18,390
future committees we decided generally a

623
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,499
support we would like the project

624
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,629
committee in the chapter three

625
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:23,459
conference could be and whatever in

626
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,529
democracy so we don't really what you

627
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,920
like a mental illness but we cannot be

628
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:31,349
donors it's you as our community may him

629
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,049
any leg pain is something I think there

630
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:37,109
would be a spoon process how to apply is

631
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:40,200
almost we need pursue how to make heaven

632
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:47,150
which time and so it's a yes for any

633
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:50,069
organism into it people fall into the

634
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:52,170
group its own process how to establish

635
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:55,410
committee which to call it head before

636
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:58,859
us to heaven just as really be point in

637
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:00,118
the future employee and how does one go

638
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,400
about joining one of the existing

639
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,079
committees but how does somebody join an

640
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,029
existing committee or we doesn't already

641
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,739
in the process so it's all process it's

642
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:09,569
all ascribe it to something most of the

643
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:11,940
policy is most limited list and

644
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:14,130
implicated if something is that we need

645
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,719
to describe and it's requirement is to

646
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:21,119
describe is being a committee leader who

647
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,009
the same type of thing in benefits and

648
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,569
environment as being a project leader

649
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:26,569
directly I don't want

650
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:53,230
correct you have to be a project or

651
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:56,079
chapter leader yes no tendency to do so

652
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,030
and finished off step up and say you

653
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,700
will lead the person committee to be

654
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:06,970
accepted as the first person he hasn't

655
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:11,109
he's working through the hall mr.

656
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:12,609
dependable the scope part of that

657
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,790
proposal is having the necessary

658
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:31,210
officers for the committee so if you're

659
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:38,800
interested absolutely you don't get lost

660
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:40,270
but very contact because your house how

661
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:51,940
many people in here have ever been on a

662
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:53,410
committee of ID so Amita is very

663
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,490
rewarding experience I was on the

664
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,490
conference's equation

665
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:53,920
[Applause]

666
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:21,269
there are five

667
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,269
[Music]

668
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:49,889
[Music]

669
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:59,849
[Music]

670
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:19,619
[Applause]

671
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:19,618
other questions

672
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,669
[Music]

673
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:08,329
[Music]

674
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,840
[Music]

675
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,780
[Music]

676
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:51,940
this place creations like southern those

677
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:59,099
of us all and cost what we see to my

678
00:45:51,940 --> 00:46:03,359
place bringing in all these products

679
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,359
this problem

680
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:08,829
okay sorry cottage cheese - is - is a

681
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:11,799
more minimalist person I must

682
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:16,229
recovery for Sin City and about the

683
00:47:11,799 --> 00:47:20,019
website we are writing with our our duty

684
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:22,118
to fight do we find support 12 atop page

685
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:25,419
for any book because it book seems to be

686
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:28,119
what are the two news but another one in

687
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,459
order to provide a some kind of relief

688
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,719
act of blend things that can be reused a

689
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:39,788
user as a tweak it for for new project

690
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:45,789
so such it can be decided to use a set

691
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:50,819
box this type of topic but as a judge we

692
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:54,910
have not quit that design this parasite

693
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:58,509
about the translations in fact my main

694
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:03,649
concern about a chi Chi's it's right to

695
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:05,099
the maintenance because like the 47th

696
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:09,039
[Music]

697
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:12,759
Street I think we are for the

698
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,739
maintenance we are picky but if we

699
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:17,349
sponsored by the retribution Chinese

700
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:20,559
cinema my first question

701
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:23,859
suppose movie will be judged to maintain

702
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:27,519
the core content because if it was late

703
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:31,390
even if process we must maintain to

704
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:32,229
issue another passion so in fact about

705
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:37,600
the foundation

706
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:39,970
put in porn this process just because I

707
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,500
asked about the maintenance of your

708
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,390
cheat sheet because it wasn't main

709
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,820
issues that in waste words about the

710
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:50,790
quality of the content and it's a reason

711
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:54,640
why we have borders is a sponsorship

712
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:58,060
processing awaiting some kind of her by

713
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,160
small so cadence of what is fact so I

714
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,810
don't know if it's a sin for you will

715
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,390
put your project for example in

716
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,009
transition but just to give you some

717
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,890
information about the church isn't a

718
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:18,100
concern about the design and the

719
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:21,400
devastation was example I I don't bother

720
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,950
I exist

721
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,300
threads and slide and we've already

722
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:31,180
started it's a creative simply have the

723
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:36,160
default for new product for example and

724
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:39,250
to give given to those this new process

725
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:43,750
not to reinvent and make each other

726
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:47,109
platform and it will simply use base

727
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:50,410
platform based framework it can give you

728
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:54,869
for example pathway as a remember place

729
00:49:50,410 --> 00:50:00,279
in localization in Reverse I mean

730
00:49:54,869 --> 00:50:02,710
service version and teach it's simple in

731
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,680
the same time it's not my knee

732
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:11,650
it's not my magic for this but because

733
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:15,460
it's changes very quickly and very over

734
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:20,250
and I think about maybe more stable

735
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:22,760
projects staple sets religious not every

736
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:27,589
month

737
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:31,760
so we can choose we can choose a rigid

738
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:36,589
dose service or some sort of that but to

739
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:39,859
forgive and at least one s suffice and

740
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:41,538
single form for others and maybe some

741
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:45,230
false prophets can choose another

742
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:55,099
another one but it will be decision

743
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:57,470
about six products some of it is a

744
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:59,660
standardization problem I think what you

745
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:03,529
have here you're talking multiple things

746
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,839
for one what is the sub domains which we

747
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,280
can talk about creating and certainly

748
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,990
one of the things we're going to do

749
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,799
moving forward making sure that we have

750
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:16,339
appropriate subdomains for each part if

751
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:20,299
you will the losses so that's the first

752
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:21,170
part second is the translation issue one

753
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:23,538
of the things we want to do with the

754
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:27,109
project committee is to have them work

755
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:29,319
on services for projects and one of

756
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:32,000
those is providing translation services

757
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:35,630
and documentation is one of those unique

758
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,430
things project because if you're working

759
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,890
software it's fairly standardized

760
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:41,629
I'll call it standardized anyway we're

761
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,270
doing about ITN files the stands for

762
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:46,140
international

763
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:47,790
and you you create a process that

764
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,500
basically goes out and looks at the

765
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:54,900
strings and brings you back you know

766
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:57,510
you're translating copy if you will and

767
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,760
for documentation is a lot different so

768
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:03,030
if there's anything that we can learn

769
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:07,230
from what you are doing and what cheat

770
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:09,450
sheets is doing that would help us to

771
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:15,740
figure out how to do translations of

772
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:22,230
documentation better services to help

773
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:26,310
yeah as I remember you when we use

774
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:29,370
scroll and drop them yes before in the

775
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,170
past that's true and it's not outside of

776
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:33,359
the realm of what we would like to do in

777
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:35,310
the future your project is somewhat

778
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,710
different from teachings I understand

779
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:40,590
perfectly well by it is that you would

780
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:43,200
have such a major issue with keeping

781
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,920
translations up today because even even

782
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,859
though the translation is done

783
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,930
automatically it's not right you can say

784
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,030
that right it is not right it doesn't

785
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,560
matter if if you're doing an automatic

786
00:52:51,030 --> 00:53:00,950
translation is not when you write

787
00:52:52,560 --> 00:53:07,049
something wrong I think some companies

788
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:12,060
give her some translators translation

789
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:13,859
big big products become even for

790
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,900
centuries so yeah you're talking about

791
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:22,109
project services specifically and yes we

792
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:27,690
are going to definitely be there another

793
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:31,078
witness and notice right now it's it

794
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:35,670
looks like not very easy for companies

795
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:39,210
to make cooperate you know my dear coke

796
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:43,250
adoration with almost in case of two

797
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:53,700
ends I mean for example if we have some

798
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:57,030
big speech conference it will be very

799
00:53:53,700 --> 00:54:00,270
interesting to have some kind of robust

800
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:05,640
tracking needs for example and it will

801
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:08,759
give some problems and comes to always

802
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,430
stand for this conference and right now

803
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,670
it's not easy to make a declaration and

804
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:23,430
to deregulate if we fail for some

805
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:26,780
simplified way to do it because right

806
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:31,828
now it's it's not possible to use was

807
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:36,349
brand and the last break-in and calls

808
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:36,349
for example distract my

809
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,440
branding in particular is something

810
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:08,540
we're discussing so whatever feedback

811
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,099
the community has would be welcome one

812
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,200
of the challenges we have is we wanted

813
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:15,020
to make sure that it's clear if it's an

814
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,169
ax wasp event versus a supportive diving

815
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:20,060
type of event and we have compliance

816
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:23,180
issues not both sides of that today

817
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:24,680
as Harold pointed out the ID here's the

818
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,810
purse is to simplify so we've been

819
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:29,270
trying to kind of define how things are

820
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:31,069
supposed to work in the case of you know

821
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:33,710
sponsoring events we haven't really been

822
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:35,630
able to nail that down when it comes to

823
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:39,650
brandy the one that we have decided to

824
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:41,270
do and when the process of doing is for

825
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,339
instance giving their trademarks under

826
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:46,369
control this is something that does not

827
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:50,000
exist today so for instance you know

828
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:51,290
legally community advice but if you want

829
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,940
to have a conference I call it oh well

830
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:57,200
so there'd be no teeth for us to stop

831
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:59,780
you because we don't have a trademark so

832
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,759
we need the first thing that up before

833
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,740
we get started or see some of those

834
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,150
things now it's well known and then can

835
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:08,270
we go it out those people that did that

836
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:09,319
but legally we have no recourse today so

837
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:13,220
we're trying to get the trademarks of

838
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:14,599
their control standards on Navy so

839
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,098
you'll see how our conferences are going

840
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:20,390
to be called global have sec and then a

841
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:22,400
city or those we are working to get the

842
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,920
chapter melbourne's to do a degree event

843
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,020
called

844
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,750
second day and so we're going to get the

845
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,759
term perhaps that day days to use for

846
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:31,530
our regional conferences if they want to

847
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,630
use and Trademark image that we can

848
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:35,430
protect so we're kind of working from

849
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:38,490
the top down but when it comes to

850
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:40,230
licensing that have a really good so if

851
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,558
you have a feedback or ideas that

852
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,690
something you're not the best dancer but

853
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,630
that's the truth I'd rather give you the

854
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:51,559
truth than a lot of that stuff and if

855
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:55,260
you do that by that's it's fabulous

856
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:57,000
if you do have an is the if the project

857
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,569
committee I'm sure would love to hear

858
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,540
them

859
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:03,290
that's a good location to go to for us

860
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:05,609
to collect that information especially

861
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:10,049
specifically refers to projects and

862
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:11,700
event and I think we have to be

863
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:14,460
carefully doing this beautys you have to

864
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,140
decide how much centralized control we

865
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,910
want the how much in marketing do we

866
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,740
want right you know I think the reason

867
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,509
why us has thrived is because people are

868
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:24,089
able to take on and do what they want to

869
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:26,160
do how they want to do it that does

870
00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:28,710
create conflict when you get to be in

871
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,200
destination but the alternative is that

872
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,579
we control it from the start and I'm not

873
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,040
sure the community would love that every

874
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:40,349
time so is trying to find that careful

875
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:43,049
balance between those two places the

876
00:57:40,349 --> 00:57:45,750
answer questions I can't make one more

877
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:48,180
plug just so yes from so you may not

878
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:50,130
know but last year projects like my

879
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,470
projects not checkers the lecture

880
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:55,819
projects spent about thirty six thousand

881
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:58,230
dollars in total this year's budget is

882
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:59,930
$200,000 if you're working on our

883
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,250
project and you need resources of money

884
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:04,589
come and ask us for it because we have

885
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:06,450
the money to spend this year okay if

886
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:09,420
you're a chapter over the last five

887
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:12,118
years we have spent around $200,000 on

888
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,650
chapter expenses this year the budget is

889
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,930
too

890
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,279
50 if you have a chapter you don't have

891
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,460
money you want to do something common

892
00:58:16,279 --> 00:58:20,480
essence if your chapter with money

893
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,170
trying to give it to somebody else that

894
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,079
does need it

895
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:26,000
alright there's enough money to go

896
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,170
around also but there's other statistic

897
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,180
we found this over the last five years

898
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,309
no chapter is spent more than five

899
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:33,288
thousand dollars per year but we have

900
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:34,640
over ten chapters I have over 60,000

901
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:36,770
dollars on the chapter budget so they

902
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,839
don't spend it which means the chapter

903
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,339
which means the foundation cannot hire a

904
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:43,009
great documentation people or other

905
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:45,770
folks to help the foundation so the more

906
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:47,240
we think about is what organization I

907
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,400
think the better off we'll be if you

908
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,740
have a project we have money that the

909
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:55,099
Lord has allocated money for projects

910
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:57,529
and we want to spend it on projects so

911
00:58:55,099 --> 00:59:02,420
let us know and we'll find a way to make

912
00:58:57,529 --> 00:59:06,380
it happen come and ask any other

913
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:08,299
questions okay let's get to the really

914
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,809
important stuff and that's the pizza and

915
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:10,809
the drinks

916
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,219
[Applause]

917
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,579
