1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:05,250
so thanks for joining this talk or the

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,309
title of this talk is vehicle security

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:15,990
trends implications for the auto

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:17,990
supplier so the brief intro of myself my

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,570
name is Aaron Guzman I'm based out in

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,390
Los Angeles I head up an automotive and

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,519
IOT testing team for a company called a

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,679
on I lead the wasp IOT project in the

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,800
embedded application security project

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,559
I'll be talking about those projects at

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,849
11:55 and project showcase so if you

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,099
want to hear about some updates and

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,530
things that were working on I think it's

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:49,200
Hall G a couple of things as far as

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,530
background within automotive space and

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,350
IOT help facilitated the automotive ice

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,590
ax first tabletop exercise about two

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,430
years ago down in Honda in Los Angeles

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,400
which is a experience with several of

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,650
the OEM manufacturers as well as Tier

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,659
one suppliers basically going through a

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,960
mock of an of an incident and how they

23
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,280
would respond if you've ever interacted

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,110
with anyone from the automotive space

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,390
they don't like to really collaborate

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,350
too much so it was definitely eight

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,270
hours of pulling teeth

28
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,789
outside from that published the book IOT

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,810
penetration testing cookbook in November

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,079
of 2017

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,920
and also edited a few IOT security books

32
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,210
with packet publishing outside of that I

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,829
love pizza I am disappointed that I

34
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,270
packed pizza socks but I packed two

35
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:48,329
different pizza socks and I decided to

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:52,710
leave them back in my room so outside of

37
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,929
that have disclosed some some security

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,329
research for automotive analogy products

39
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,570
specifically for Subaru was able to

40
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,199
compromise a Subaru vehicle at users to

41
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,740
the ikaw basically the essential

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,020
functions of Starlin Subaru StarLink on

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,640
you know unlocking cars and honking horn

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,430
flashing lights things like that

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,200
had some fun that was a couple years ago

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,090
now

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,700
so enough about me go through the brief

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,490
agenda here we're gonna talk about some

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,079
advancements in the automotive space

50
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,230
talk about suppliers and their

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,320
development lifecycle go through some

52
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,989
research case studies also also some

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,590
field work that we've performed and got

54
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:41,190
hired for suppliers and manufacturers as

55
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,950
well and go through some solutions

56
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,880
mitigated mitigative solutions and then

57
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,510
if we have time we'll go through

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:53,519
questions so there's some some major

59
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,899
trends going on here within the

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,520
automotive space one is electrification

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,570
the other is mobility mobility mobility

62
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,170
as a service autonomy south driving

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,620
vehicles and connectivity all of which

64
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,850
are kind of in a way dependent on each

65
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,900
other essentially what the automotive

66
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:22,980
industry is doing is not only becoming a

67
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,130
product product but also technology a

68
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,329
company filled with services in the way

69
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,070
of integrating with not only the vehicle

70
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,860
itself but also third parties and we'll

71
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,420
get to some of those concerns in a bit

72
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,790
but in order for you know full autonomy

73
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,089
full self-driving cars you'll have to

74
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,269
have full connectivity perhaps

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,370
electrification moving forward as well

76
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,250
the majority of newer vehicles already

77
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,230
have some of this functionality as far

78
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,959
as connectivity autonomy and we'll go

79
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,268
through some of the levels in a sec but

80
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,660
essentially this is what's going on as

81
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,799
far as you know new developments and I

82
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,780
guess you know first will touch upon

83
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,019
connectivity and what's happening in the

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,340
connectivity space for automotive

85
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,760
usually in order to connect a vehicle

86
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,430
you'll have either telematics control

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,260
unit or board and usually you'll have

88
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,900
some sort of network connection via LTE

89
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,180
I can even have a via Wi-Fi I'm moving

90
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,750
forward maybe we'll see some 5g and then

91
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,190
what we really have some

92
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:29,680
you know Thomas vehicles go now so with

93
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,610
connectivity we have these new kind of

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,140
alphabet soup acronyms you have vehicle

95
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,080
to infrastructure or your cars talking

96
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,400
to the infrastructure vehicle to vehicle

97
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,169
vehicle to pedestrian vehicle device

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,929
vehicle to grid and vehicle to

99
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,230
everything again these are all

100
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,960
requirements for connectivity and

101
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,370
vehicles moving forward again you know

102
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,500
vehicle to vehicle is just basically

103
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,020
exchanging you know certain information

104
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,669
about traffic about distance and

105
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,919
metadata

106
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:03,310
vehicle to infrastructure similar

107
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,280
similar kind of architecture except you

108
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,190
know talking to me basically

109
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,869
infrastructure for roadside units and

110
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,780
intelligent traffic systems in the

111
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,419
future so a lot of exciting things going

112
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,489
on but certainly obviously you know

113
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:21,729
expands the attack surface from a

114
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,150
security perspective with all these

115
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,410
acronyms and connectivity requirements

116
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:33,390
you also have new companies and

117
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,590
suppliers who are developing software

118
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,099
outside of you know the traditional way

119
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,169
and manufacturers so some of these

120
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,210
demands in order for connectivity to

121
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,620
actually work we need you need to you

122
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,890
need the vehicle to be cloud connected

123
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,530
24/7 ability to perform secure

124
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,539
over-the-air updates not only for the

125
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,460
vehicle itself but also components and

126
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,740
we're seeing this with safety critical

127
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,870
components with Tesla which is a little

128
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,180
scary we now have basically DevOps

129
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,200
in vehicles now it's kind of cool but

130
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,460
kind of scary also similarly with ivi

131
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,930
applications so they had unit

132
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,690
applications now I guess being pushed

133
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,570
down from the manufacturers they'll want

134
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,550
updates to be on the fly so update

135
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:23,140
updates to your head unit applications

136
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,760
are also coming down in the future if

137
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,229
not already I believe some manufacturers

138
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,390
already have that in place and with

139
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,099
connectivity you have more data more

140
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,560
data that's being shared not only with

141
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:36,580
the manufacturers suppliers and the

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,160
infrastructure in state

143
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,289
but also third-party services in order

144
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,150
to you know whatever whatever maybe for

145
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,290
licensing which is basically selling

146
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,270
that data another word that's been kind

147
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,950
of coined in the industry they don't

148
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:57,010
like to say you know we're selling your

149
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:59,140
data other licensing your data and of

150
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:01,270
course not only with you know being

151
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,760
connected all the time 24/7 not only

152
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,909
with secure up updates but also they

153
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,120
want reliable connections they want

154
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:13,000
resiliency some redundancy and obviously

155
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,650
security meaning you know going through

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,380
secure channels whether that's

157
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,830
end-to-end encryption or using other

158
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,030
means

159
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,460
hopefully not through proprietary

160
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,460
protocols which are being debunked now

161
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:30,580
so with connectivity we talked about

162
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:33,120
autonomy a TAS is also a an acronym used

163
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:38,080
but essentially there's five levels of

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,270
autonomy are currently around level two

165
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,090
here which is you know the driver assist

166
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,159
a pro pilot assist the the Lane Lane

167
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,250
Departure assistance there are vehicles

168
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,660
that are said to be level three I think

169
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,280
some one of the newer out er eights but

170
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:59,110
there's there's some some great areas

171
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,270
here with level three meaning if the

172
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,970
vehicle is driving and there is a

173
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,919
there's a driver behind the wheel or

174
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,080
vehicle operator they're supposed to be

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,540
ready to intervene at any time but

176
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,890
chances are if your cars already self

177
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,410
driving you're not going to be engaged

178
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:18,719
it's going to be very difficult at least

179
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:21,820
to be ready especially if you know the

180
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,800
the vehicle isn't isn't planning for

181
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:30,460
certain situations so every manufacturer

182
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,549
already has a level two you know a level

183
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,610
two autonomy in their in their model

184
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:41,199
years you know the the fours the GM's

185
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:44,230
the Subarus the the Toyotas I think

186
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,670
after 2017 and up is when every vehicle

187
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,970
is already equipped with telematics

188
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,410
units so installed whether you are a

189
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,690
subscriber or not

190
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,400
so you got to think about that unless

191
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:59,680
you take out that telematics unit but

192
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,410
it's it's it's it's said that we'll have

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,560
full autonomy within the next ten years

194
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:09,370
if not sooner I think there is a huge of

195
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:14,800
dependence upon 5g so some real scary

196
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:18,370
situations but essentially there's you

197
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,010
know self-driving trucks already in in

198
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,200
the field so it's also causing

199
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:27,700
disruption for for the for the economy

200
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,930
so just be mindful of some of these

201
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,850
levels here we'll get to some of the

202
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,010
concerns in a second here but

203
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,950
essentially drivers are fading away and

204
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,390
now becoming vehicle operators and

205
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:44,680
they're even hiring for vehicle

206
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:47,430
operators which is crazy so quick quick

207
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,290
a graph here from from Edmunds showing

208
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,589
the active safety features basically

209
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,089
when the vehicle is taking control of

210
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,300
something that will cause safety

211
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,790
concerns which is adaptive cruise blind

212
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,010
spot detection lane departure you can

213
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,189
see on the rise essentially you know

214
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,340
again this is only 2017 pretty much

215
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,910
we're probably in the 80 to 90 percent

216
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:15,760
percentile for active safety features

217
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,880
with newer cars but what's scary is that

218
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,670
we're giving up our trust to someone

219
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,460
else's code or several thousand people

220
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:27,040
people's code who are writing the

221
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:32,070
software you know to keep to keep you

222
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,069
safe to keep you happy convenient

223
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,490
there's even aftermarket autonomy

224
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:44,819
meaning devices that you can install on

225
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,820
your vehicle cameras aftermarket

226
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:51,670
basically wheels that will again do some

227
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,370
self-driving functions for you which is

228
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:59,680
really really sketchy but I wanted to

229
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:01,589
share a specific quote here from there's

230
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,199
a company called lane cruise and

231
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,760
basically they're retrofitting vehicles

232
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,250
only to be connected but again have

233
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,680
these autonomous features so scrolling

234
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,140
through their page and you know going

235
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,760
through the FAQ and they have at present

236
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,380
and most your addictions level to

237
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,280
autonomy is not regulated and hence

238
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,420
totally legal this is why I can buy a

239
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,490
luxury car or some of these features

240
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,439
built in without any legal implications

241
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,980
it's all right away I mean that's some

242
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,790
red flags and this is just again an

243
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,990
aftermarket this is an aftermarket

244
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,510
company that's developing software

245
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,090
people are using this in their vehicles

246
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,250
already super super scary I couldn't

247
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,060
imagine you know this linkers company

248
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,730
you know even if it has several hundred

249
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:50,760
employees or developers I'm sure that

250
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,630
there are some flaws several different

251
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,480
types of flaws but just the thought of

252
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:00,240
this code being introduced into vehicles

253
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,980
expanding that you know you know older

254
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,920
type of vehicle you know this El Camino

255
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:09,560
for example a 90s 80s car that's now

256
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,560
going to have self-driving capabilities

257
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,530
so you know given the example of the

258
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,370
startup startup company Ling Cruz you're

259
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,569
probably wondering you know who's

260
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,040
building and innovating in this base

261
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,950
like who's responsible for developing

262
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,849
this software and it's just a sea of

263
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:30,270
partnerships acquisitions and newer

264
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,460
types of OMS who are building south

265
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,530
driving vehicles from the ground up and

266
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,440
fleets

267
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,480
so essentially you know loads of Silicon

268
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,330
Valley startups who you know are

269
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,700
proposing perhaps Ling Cruz might be

270
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,130
acquired by you know a manufacturer at

271
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,280
some point but what's happening is OMS

272
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,230
are essentially turning into venture

273
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,120
capitalists angel investors acquiring

274
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,780
these companies partnering with these

275
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,480
companies and then working with Tier one

276
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:05,640
suppliers and this graph is purely just

277
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,970
the relationships in 2017 for autonomous

278
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,960
vehicles and who's partnering with who

279
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:15,930
essentially everyone's partnering with

280
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:17,880
someone or perhaps a same supplier and

281
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,989
supplier is well we'll get to in a

282
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,670
second so essentially again third-party

283
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,440
companies who are developing this

284
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,670
software it's not the OEM manufacturers

285
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,620
who are developing you know all the

286
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,029
software that had units the in vehicle

287
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,480
networks there's a lot of third parties

288
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,480
involved

289
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,140
so the supplier types and roles if you

290
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,160
ever opened up the hood of your car

291
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:46,260
you'll see several different names of

292
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,380
the product manufacturers so you'll have

293
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,689
the hardware components which you know

294
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,540
the body control the body control

295
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,820
modules powertrain sensors your gateways

296
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,260
cryptographic modules and so forth

297
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,890
but you also have the software

298
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,720
components which is the platform

299
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,060
operating system it could be Q and X it

300
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,120
could be AUTOSAR that's being used it

301
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,640
could be an older Microsoft but also

302
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,459
there are third-party suppliers who

303
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,490
develop drivers and libraries to help

304
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:20,069
connect you know certain areas of the

305
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,220
hardware from the software perspective

306
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,810
and then also the supplier to develop

307
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,880
the ivi applications the mobile

308
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,260
applications or web applications you

309
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,900
know it's not again it's not these

310
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,700
manufacturers who are developing this

311
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,279
software it's the partnering with the

312
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,990
supplier a third party essentially in

313
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,529
order for this to happen to be pushed

314
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,690
out so a lot of moving parts right a lot

315
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,970
of you know a lot of cooks in the

316
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,279
kitchen just for one product and this is

317
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,339
this is similar not only for automotive

318
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,040
but IOT as a whole anything really

319
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,260
product are embedded related essentially

320
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,040
has a similar structure of supply chain

321
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,980
and development but what's you know you

322
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,819
know I don't want to fear monger here or

323
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,579
but just kind of get to gain a

324
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,100
perspective the the amount of code

325
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:11,010
that's in a vehicle ranges from 100 to

326
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,750
300 million lines of code and this is

327
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,529
not only just the in vehicle networks

328
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:20,160
but also the head units and several

329
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:23,070
other aspects of a vehicle there's four

330
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,020
there's 40,000 Hardware parts and this

331
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,670
data was taken from Toyota so this is

332
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,350
Toyota's estimates

333
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,779
and think about that there's code and

334
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,800
hardware and software and wireless

335
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:39,350
protocols essentially code is everywhere

336
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,829
and you know folks like us and oh wasps

337
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,750
are here to help try to gain a you know

338
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,040
insider perspective not only from an

339
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:52,279
attacker but also for secure coding we

340
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,199
reviewed Anitha an IV I application one

341
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,509
application that's a default application

342
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,459
on several vehicles there was six

343
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,980
million lines of code just for a head

344
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:04,040
unit application this is the client-side

345
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,519
and server-side code which is crazy six

346
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,079
million lines of code it's absurd and

347
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,120
it's only going to be more code being

348
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,680
introduced moving forward you know with

349
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,250
all the you know connectivity

350
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:22,399
requirements the v2 vvt-i tana me so

351
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:26,089
difficult to try and guarantee safety

352
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,819
and security with that much code and

353
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:32,180
especially legacy code and code that

354
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:34,729
perhaps a supplier is developing for not

355
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,138
only one manufacturer but let's say for

356
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:47,029
manufacturers so again everything is

357
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:48,529
code so this is just an observation here

358
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,680
based upon some of the assessments that

359
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,850
we've done so we've not only done

360
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,550
penetration testing assessments but also

361
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,980
maturity or use for suppliers and this

362
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,569
could be a even a supplier coming to us

363
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,370
and they're partnering with a

364
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:05,059
third-party company let's say in India

365
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:08,959
and they want us to review if there s

366
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:10,579
DLC is if there's if basically if

367
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,470
they're saying that they're testing

368
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,139
they're doing source code analysis

369
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:19,880
dynamic and so forth they call us in to

370
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:23,780
verify kind of do you know align with

371
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:29,210
like open Sam for example a software

372
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:32,299
assurance maturity model so we've been

373
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,090
engaged with multiple suppliers who are

374
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:39,530
publicly traded companies who have over

375
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:41,779
300 developers and zero to three

376
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,379
cybersecurity professionals

377
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:47,230
which is amazing to me and some of the

378
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:49,428
requirements to job posting requirements

379
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,379
don't want five or seven years in

380
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,470
security they want some engineering

381
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:56,539
experience basically you know they're

382
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,129
asking for the world here but yet they

383
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:01,340
they have no one internally to even

384
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:03,709
interpret let's say their source code

385
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,279
analysis output

386
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,950
you know reports and so forth so if you

387
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,960
look through a number of different

388
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,720
suppliers career pages they're pretty

389
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,720
they're pretty entertaining but again

390
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,239
shocking that I guess not not super

391
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,970
shocking but that you know the lack of

392
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:24,679
you know security within a safety

393
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,570
critical area or critical infrastructure

394
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,340
now you know moving forward with

395
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,710
vehicles you know isn't getting much

396
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,959
love but hopefully that'll change moving

397
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,379
forward I know several manufacturers are

398
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,989
now have internal red teams which wasn't

399
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:40,689
a thing before I think in the last three

400
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:43,460
years I think the majority of

401
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,799
manufacturers do aside from some Jap

402
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:50,480
Japanese manufacturers will call them

403
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:52,519
out but to run through the software

404
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,379
development life supply chain here

405
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,379
essentially you'll start with the OEM

406
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:58,668
who defines the specifications for what

407
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:00,918
they need what they want whatever

408
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,929
whatever may be for either telematics

409
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,320
control unit a head unit a body control

410
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,999
module but essentially you'll start with

411
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,999
the hardware requirements you'll have

412
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:15,499
your board support package that could be

413
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:18,320
working with a driver company comm or

414
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:19,460
whoever else a boss whoever whoever it

415
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,850
could be you have your downstream

416
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,480
suppliers your software suppliers

417
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,119
essentially people who are developing

418
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,460
the code your cloud providers whether

419
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,580
it's AWS whether it's ours or whether

420
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,139
it's their own in-house cloud and then

421
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,399
you have integrators who work with these

422
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:38,928
suppliers in order to kind of ease that

423
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:42,529
that transition to a production

424
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:44,059
environment so then you have you know

425
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:47,119
several third parties several different

426
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:50,509
teams involved from around the world

427
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:54,230
and then for me you know looking at kind

428
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:56,990
of the the overall process

429
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,179
and from the handoffs from team the team

430
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,860
there are several flaws that you can

431
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,950
obviously identify but a number of

432
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,399
different third-party code and teams to

433
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,290
be targeted super simple we could easily

434
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,850
target an open source library or a

435
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:17,000
software supplier and any of these

436
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:20,000
stages you know in order to get you know

437
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,710
not only effect again I mentioned 101

438
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,140
OEM manufacturer but several so a lot

439
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:31,700
going on again very very similar

440
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:35,510
landscape for IOT devices as well aside

441
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,210
from the integrators but just imagine

442
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:44,629
this area here branched off into maybe

443
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:46,280
20 other different suppliers so not only

444
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,440
are you know we're having legitimate

445
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,809
software suppliers via you know tiered

446
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,590
you know tier 1 2 to tier 2 or 3 but now

447
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:57,200
they're expanding this supply chain with

448
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,240
third-party development services and you

449
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,820
know basically essentially having

450
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,400
cryptocurrency in your vehicle now how

451
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:08,168
amazing is that or not

452
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,179
Jaguar just released a program where

453
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:14,870
you'll have a smart wallet in your

454
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:17,900
vehicle that basically it'll report the

455
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,449
potholes and flaws in the road so

456
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,570
essentially you're getting paid

457
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:26,630
automatically for your vehicle and also

458
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,020
pay using your car for services whether

459
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:34,160
it's a gas or you know going for a

460
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,950
coffee of some sort so these services

461
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,400
again are a little bit makes me a little

462
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:44,090
bit nervous again having cryptocurrency

463
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,309
here in cryptocurrency for your vehicles

464
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,340
and other manufacturers are also

465
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:53,389
following following the same trend Honda

466
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:56,209
just released their mobile wallet in CES

467
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,320
this past year again integrating with

468
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,960
third-party services and the

469
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,428
infrastructure of the services being

470
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,340
offered by gas stations and restaurants

471
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:07,909
and so forth GM has its own marketplace

472
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,369
you can order

473
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,499
again you know Starbucks get some donuts

474
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:15,468
my personal favorite is Applebee's

475
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:19,899
there's no Applebee's here but one of my

476
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:23,799
favorites so this this app marketplace

477
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:27,468
think of it like a Android Play Store

478
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:29,599
were essentially previously legacy apps

479
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,499
you know where you didn't have much to

480
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,539
choose from

481
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:35,479
was just whatever is default and maybe a

482
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:37,219
few others that you can install but now

483
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:40,099
you have the opportunity to pull down

484
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:43,309
the apps from a marketplace and do some

485
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:46,428
reverse engineering disassembling and so

486
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,019
forth you know with the apps in the

487
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,849
marketplace or you can just develop your

488
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:54,589
own third-party app using you know their

489
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:56,539
developers program they supply you with

490
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:58,190
an SDK they supply you with emulators

491
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:00,679
they supply you with everything you'll

492
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,409
be you're essentially need to get off

493
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,199
the ground so you have folks like you

494
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:09,259
and I who can develop software for your

495
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:13,009
cars and some of the the level of access

496
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:15,349
that the these SDKs have are access to

497
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:18,349
the internal vehicle networks so you can

498
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:20,089
scrape can bus you can you know scrape

499
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:24,829
maybe a media network whatever you want

500
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:27,049
essentially so really scared from that

501
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:28,849
perspective again opening up that you

502
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:30,829
know traditional kind of closed off you

503
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,718
know no network environment no you know

504
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:34,879
apps you know that probably never get

505
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:39,799
updated on your head unit to a more

506
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:42,139
dynamic landscape and more open with

507
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,539
third-party developers and you know

508
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:46,609
they'll have minimal vetting for

509
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:50,949
developing software and becoming a

510
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:55,879
partner or a supplier but anyone who is

511
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:58,699
motivated or you know has an end goal

512
00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:01,099
for compromising a vehicle can easily do

513
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:04,999
it via you know their third-party

514
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:07,789
developer portals other services like

515
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:12,279
Amazon's key and car with Ford's and

516
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:16,279
Lincoln basically unlock your car um for

517
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:18,450
Amazon delivery drivers so again not

518
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,280
only are you trusting

519
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,780
you know strangers to enter your vehicle

520
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,639
but we also talked about the the sick

521
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,310
the adaptive safety features for your

522
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,890
car you know the lane departures and so

523
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,179
forth

524
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:34,230
this is a massive target right and it's

525
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,370
easy to to put some attention here just

526
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,570
because you know the getting the many

527
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,580
different hands many different teams

528
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:44,280
many different services and it's only

529
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:46,970
going to increase moving forward and

530
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:50,730
this is already happening again in IOT

531
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,590
anybody here heard of Mariah so it

532
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,270
affected the US but also you know other

533
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,500
other countries around the world but it

534
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,470
took down the internet for a period of

535
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,910
time a couple years back and essentially

536
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:06,450
what was what happened was attackers

537
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:08,190
targeted a certain original design

538
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,840
manufacturer ODM which is another word

539
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,810
for supplier there's all these different

540
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,659
same terms for different industry

541
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:19,260
verticals but odm is essentially a

542
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:23,100
supplier so they targeted zhong my and

543
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,680
zhang my they created essentially the

544
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,310
the embedded linux platform that then

545
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:32,160
was built built upon for you know custom

546
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,649
resellers or custom om manufacturers to

547
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,750
use and there were you know default

548
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,540
talonnet credentials and command

549
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,990
injections and so forth but not only

550
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,750
zhang MA you also have you know blue

551
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,910
board and you have crack you have

552
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,250
meltdown specter which are all you know

553
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,810
third-party software that's installed in

554
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,690
safety critical functions in a vehicle

555
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:59,250
and even IOT devices and there's more

556
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,180
examples but it's already happening also

557
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,790
something to keep in mind is the

558
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,780
difficulty of updating these these these

559
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:10,350
devices so not only in IOT but also just

560
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,180
general software they're you know

561
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,209
there's nation state nation state or

562
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,680
even malicious groups out there who are

563
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,360
targeting the supply chain i believe

564
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,420
there's even a talk on supply chain

565
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,929
today as well probably more towards

566
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,060
javascript because that's also a mess

567
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:29,450
but essentially you know we have these

568
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,590
groups here focusing on

569
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:37,140
installing or developing backdoors and

570
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,270
injecting those into you know let's say

571
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:43,050
like Asus for example who was affected

572
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:45,240
by by this group as well as ccleaner you

573
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,040
know or there was backdoors and they

574
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,400
speak compromising one of the suppliers

575
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,610
in order to gain full control remote

576
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:00,240
code execution this is just you know not

577
00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:01,800
too long ago so you so what I did talk a

578
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,250
little bit about updating or lack

579
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,040
thereof but essentially a vehicle has a

580
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,650
life cycle of our lifespan of seven to

581
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,430
fifteen years a traditional vehicle this

582
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:16,230
is changing moving forward but you know

583
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,810
a vehicle could be you know vulnerable

584
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,610
for a long period of time or may not

585
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:23,580
ever be updated maybe there isn't an

586
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,439
over there Update solution for certain

587
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,480
model years which has happened for

588
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,960
several manufacturers well they'll send

589
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,140
a USB stick for you to install an update

590
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,830
I won't speak in that in detail but

591
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,700
probably better solutions so you know

592
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,220
again you have all these third-party

593
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,980
code applications and services that can

594
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,820
potentially be completely vulnerable for

595
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,820
an extended period of time

596
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,139
so some some case studies here that's

597
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,430
happened within the last year year and a

598
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:59,610
half there was some work done by a a

599
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,910
research firm or security firm where

600
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,040
they shopped around for vehicles to

601
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,990
remotely exploit flaws and what they

602
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:11,340
chose were vehicles that had a large

603
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,090
attack surface that being a Volkswagen

604
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,090
Golf and Audi

605
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,620
they essentially use the same head unit

606
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,649
again because the same supplier they're

607
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,050
also a part of the same company but they

608
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,650
discovered some vulnerabilities within

609
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:29,190
the Wi-Fi hotspot and essentially gain

610
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,800
remote code execution in several

611
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:36,060
different ways one of them was via a

612
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:38,669
service in town net as well as gaining

613
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,450
access to a certain area of the vehicle

614
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:45,500
where you can send arbitrary Ken

615
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:47,270
can messages to the canvas but what they

616
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,400
did was they stopped there they didn't

617
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,020
release technical details because the

618
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,120
vehicles those vehicles do not have

619
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,350
update functionality and they felt that

620
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,050
they would leave those vehicles at RIT

621
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,360
at risk and some of the suppliers there

622
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,480
a note our block is blackberry Q and X

623
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,159
and NVIDIA and here's the the head unit

624
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,610
that got routed on the head unit QNX

625
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,640
neutrino is a common operating system

626
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,979
where platform used for head units

627
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,620
probably there's automotive grade Linux

628
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:20,000
and Q and X are probably the the major

629
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:22,219
platforms that are being used today but

630
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,880
essentially manufacturers are partnering

631
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,160
with blackberry in order for them to to

632
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,640
provide that platform security and

633
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,710
updates yeah in order to keep you know

634
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:39,680
the head unit as well as the safety of a

635
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:42,710
vehicle kind of in order so there was

636
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,290
some research with BMW last year as well

637
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:48,140
by Tencent labs who absolutely tore

638
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,420
these BMWs apart separate several

639
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,850
different models were affected but

640
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:56,290
essentially what they did was exploit

641
00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:00,590
multiple qnx systems that were used by

642
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:02,960
the head unit and obtained again a

643
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:06,139
remote code execution after fuzzing not

644
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,300
only the browser not only the telematics

645
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,660
control unit but even the USB interface

646
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:16,520
had USB to Ethernet so again they have

647
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,950
the they had to connect systems they had

648
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,650
third party Bluetooth stack a custom

649
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:26,390
browser by Harman again another stuff

650
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:28,910
another supplier and then the telematic

651
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:34,220
communication box was also an another

652
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:35,300
supplier in third party someone spent

653
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,580
too much time on this research because I

654
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,700
want to get into more details from some

655
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,990
of the field work that we've performed

656
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,290
but just again to show some examples in

657
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:49,310
case studies of research firms or even

658
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,990
attackers focusing in on suppliers and

659
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,810
again how that affects not only multiple

660
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,340
vehicles for same manufacturer but also

661
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,490
number of different manufacturers in

662
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:02,139
this case there was the Tesla keyfob

663
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,680
research anybody heard about this so we

664
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:08,630
cool yeah so there is the Tesla Model S

665
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:13,990
essentially was using a picture and

666
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:16,750
keyfob system where the research company

667
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,400
was able to defeat some of the wireless

668
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,740
encryption here and they were able to

669
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,900
generate key codes and essentially

670
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,550
obtain a vehicle steal vehicle and

671
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,870
definitely not just you know the

672
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,840
previous security research of obtaining

673
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:33,199
key codes number of them to start open

674
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,370
up the car stop and potentially start

675
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,580
again now they created we have the

676
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,979
capability using you know I think five

677
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,389
hundred dollars worth of hardware using

678
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,210
a guard stick one on proxmark

679
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,440
raspberry pi rainbow tables proxmox

680
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,000
already like three four hundred dollars

681
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,910
so probably a thousand dollars but

682
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,680
essentially it's possible and this same

683
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,590
key fob system was used in MacLaren's

684
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,620
which are really expensive cars as well

685
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:03,080
as motorcycles triumph so really

686
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,070
interesting to think about you know as

687
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,810
an attacker I want the highest impact

688
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,330
and something that'll get the company's

689
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:16,030
attention and again focusing in on a

690
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,030
supplier is definitely the route to go

691
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,479
so some field work that we performed

692
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,030
give an example here for an IV I

693
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,820
application or we perform multiple IV I

694
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:31,460
application assessments and this was a

695
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:37,040
default application that's installed on

696
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:38,960
several vehicles and the platform it

697
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,550
wasn't only the default application and

698
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,320
the IV I but I also had a companion

699
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,639
mobile app so some of these have hybrid

700
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,280
environments where it's connected to

701
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,600
vehicle has some functionality and

702
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,639
perhaps shares some internet

703
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,139
connectivity through that through a

704
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:56,660
mobile device but in this case or one of

705
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,980
the cases here was six million lines of

706
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:04,130
code again for the client-side and

707
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:07,070
server-side code base and you know it's

708
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:10,190
very difficult to get all the code

709
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,928
the supplier in order to compile in

710
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,440
order for us to do proper source code

711
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,840
analysis and they didn't really know all

712
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,370
the third-party libraries that they had

713
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,279
so for us that was already a light bulb

714
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,439
that we're gonna find some pretty big

715
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,659
pretty big issues you know during the

716
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,490
assessment so we so this assessment was

717
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:30,769
a gray box so we had not only the source

718
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,289
code access to the developers but also

719
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:34,700
perform dynamic testing very very

720
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:38,240
helpful probably the most effective way

721
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:41,960
to do security assessments but what we

722
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:46,669
found was loads loads of dead code

723
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,639
unused code common to code with API keys

724
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:53,529
with essentially user account

725
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:55,908
credentials database passwords

726
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:59,690
hard-coded not only their credentials

727
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:01,850
but the API endpoints which gave us an

728
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,370
easy way to get access to the admin

729
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:07,969
interfaces of all these applications

730
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:10,159
I'll get to that in a second and again

731
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,810
in this case what they were doing is

732
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,339
licensing data scraped from the canvas

733
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,190
and I'm not sure if they had these

734
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:17,328
agreements with the the OEMs I think

735
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,800
they just have the access and they're

736
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:22,460
like hey yeah we're gonna do what we

737
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,169
want because we have access so these a

738
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,980
VI applications are not only talking to

739
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:31,040
the OEMs cloud infrastructure you know

740
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,510
some OEMs require intend encryption but

741
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,779
it's also talking to their own cloud

742
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,980
infrastructure third-party cloud and you

743
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,960
can imagine that's this is only one

744
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:45,260
application in this case again you know

745
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,730
that data being shared in multiple

746
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,760
layers multiple services multiple

747
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,129
companies but with you know identifying

748
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,970
some of the hard-coded application

749
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,828
servers on a server-side infrastructure

750
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:02,149
these application servers did not even

751
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:03,710
have authentication we were able to get

752
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,210
remote code execution on these servers

753
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,720
we were able to upload our own

754
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:11,420
application servers some of the the

755
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,490
pages that we found were status pages

756
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,760
that have the ability to dump memory

757
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,919
from the application servers so

758
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,840
essentially the basics of security

759
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,170
security principles and

760
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,990
cleanliness we're not there what they

761
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,290
heavily dependent on was the OEM to go

762
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:33,049
and do their own security assessment for

763
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:35,180
for their application but essentially

764
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,280
it's like a unit test where it's about

765
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,520
two check boxes and if the features you

766
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,960
know are what what they agreed upon then

767
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,880
that's like the bare minimum if they

768
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,340
require TLS that's all they're going to

769
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,810
put is TLS they're not going to ensure

770
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,790
that they're doing output encoding and

771
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:52,220
they're not going to do some input

772
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:56,690
validation it's really really

773
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:59,410
interesting case but once the

774
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:05,450
application was running it was even

775
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:07,670
logging the API keys the user basically

776
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:10,069
coordinates the data from the canvas

777
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,390
that it was scraping essentially

778
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,100
everything it could was log to the

779
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,779
console in this case that we're using a

780
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,830
head unit that was Android based so

781
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,450
logcat super super simple to acquire

782
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,790
that data and if you've ever I don't

783
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:25,310
know if anyone has anyone done forensics

784
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:29,960
on an automotive telematics unit or a

785
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:33,410
head unit load loads of data I better

786
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,220
speed up here loads of data there here's

787
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,430
an example this is what they were doing

788
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,149
again

789
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:44,149
logging the API key secret request paths

790
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:50,480
all to the console doing basically

791
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:54,730
dynamic arbitrary code formation here in

792
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,070
Java you actually see a C and C++

793
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:00,350
encrypting I'm sorry logging again the

794
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:02,570
VIN on all the kind of safety critical

795
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:05,000
functions as well and even logging

796
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,620
usernames and passwords so really really

797
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,580
basic things that there was just you

798
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,180
know wasn't on top of their heads

799
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,759
longitude latitude

800
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,020
here's that application server with a

801
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,270
threat to you can click on any of these

802
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,980
dump the memory see what's going on with

803
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,660
what vehicle around the world because

804
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,780
this supplier not only developed company

805
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:27,259
develop software for for the US but also

806
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:31,640
Canada China South America

807
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:34,280
again this had no authentication here's

808
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,770
the application server that had default

809
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,170
credentials of course and a legacy

810
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:42,230
patchy access server where we were able

811
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:46,040
to get code execution so you know very

812
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,690
little effort unfortunately and what we

813
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,250
did is we used standard methodologies

814
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,589
and tool sets it wasn't anything crazy

815
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,059
that we did out of the ordinary we

816
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:55,670
leveraged the application security

817
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:57,260
verification standard the mobile one as

818
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,869
well the OAuth top tens

819
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:04,369
not only for for the web mobile and IOT

820
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:07,579
you know we did source code analyses

821
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:09,680
using commercial and free tools listed a

822
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,480
few tools that we used mobile security

823
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,118
framework which is a great tool if

824
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,680
anyone's used it before but was what was

825
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,859
really the key was manually reviewing

826
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,390
the code and working with the dev teams

827
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:22,880
all this although the dead and commented

828
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,520
out code is not gonna be flagged too

829
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,480
much by by tools it's going to be

830
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,849
informational at best so you know in

831
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:38,720
those comments we also found github

832
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:40,910
credentials crazy crazy crazy stuff so

833
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,410
we also do a product assessments for

834
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:45,109
fleet management companies there's Tier

835
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,730
one suppliers that essentially develop

836
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:50,290
products that plug into commercial

837
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:53,809
trucks and passenger vehicles as well

838
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:56,720
via obd2 in this case it wasn't as

839
00:38:53,809 --> 00:39:00,049
simple it didn't have much of an attack

840
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,339
surface it was using a bare metal there

841
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:04,790
was an embedded Linux a real-time

842
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:07,790
operating system but we got lucky and by

843
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,558
sniffing hardware communication via

844
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,690
serial we were able to obtain firmware

845
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:16,579
over the over-the-air credentials and

846
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:19,099
pull over 7,000 vehicle details about

847
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:21,829
maintenance about you know the drivers

848
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:24,230
about essentially you know critical

849
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:29,089
details for this commercial company tier

850
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:31,790
1 supplier but again this is also

851
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:34,940
retrofitting cars that aren't made to be

852
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:37,369
connected and again you're exposing all

853
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,700
that data now by pulling that data and

854
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:42,369
then not only for

855
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:49,919
fleets and monitoring driver riskiness

856
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:52,750
in this case but licensing as well and

857
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,089
for case number two here for a fleet

858
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,740
management supplier in this case it was

859
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:58,570
a IOT gateway and since we didn't

860
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,709
multiple these where it had Wi-Fi

861
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:06,190
Bluetooth LTE has cameras and basically

862
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:07,930
drivers connect to the hotspot and the

863
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:11,520
sensors around the vehicle connect to

864
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:17,379
the hotspot and we were able to obtain

865
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:19,750
code execution by having a live serial

866
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,500
connection but essentially what we did

867
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:26,200
was was expose our exploit open source

868
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,320
components I was using fastboot which is

869
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,020
an Android based bootloader and it had

870
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,980
debug functionality to stack trace we

871
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:39,490
were able to get a code execution by

872
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:42,790
essentially using arm assembly to then

873
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:48,240
give us a shout cess by putting in our

874
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:53,279
ssh credentials okay let me close it out

875
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:56,649
some example code here that we used

876
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,800
essentially the the bin sh here that's

877
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:02,920
what we used to get code execution

878
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,500
mounted the file systems able to input

879
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,079
our user and then get route at the end

880
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,760
of the day another finding we were able

881
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,250
to bypass secure boot by using a

882
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,589
malicious NTP server pushing down to an

883
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,810
expert expiry date that wouldn't be

884
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:19,770
recognized and we found that this is a

885
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,910
problem with all embedded devices

886
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:27,190
essentially finding a trusted source of

887
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:28,359
time interesting problem let me run

888
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,640
through these really quick I know we're

889
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,848
out of time again the suppliers are

890
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,700
reliance upon OMS to perform you know

891
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,680
security initiatives and testing there's

892
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,310
lack of security culture personnel and

893
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,500
folks who understand security within

894
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:46,660
supplier companies so especially when

895
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,609
you have these startups and newer types

896
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,319
of products that are being developed by

897
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:53,330
you know Silicon Valley companies

898
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,190
and essentially writing software that

899
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,650
had not been exposed to the internet

900
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,680
previously again we talked about these

901
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:02,240
clients that credentials and you know

902
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,700
secrets that you know would not normally

903
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,779
you know be internet-facing and now is

904
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:11,330
and you know lack of transparency

905
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,670
through the supply chain essentially you

906
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,049
know blackbox binaries are given to OEM

907
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,390
manufacturers and that are being

908
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:20,090
compiled into their head units or

909
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,129
whatever the product may be you know

910
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,680
your supply their suppliers essentially

911
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,360
have their own suppliers so this kind of

912
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,680
trickles down think about kind of the

913
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,120
the JavaScript supply chain issues so

914
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,529
we'll wrap up with some technical

915
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,200
guidance here or at least some

916
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:39,260
mitigation measures there are several

917
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,520
different best practices to bolster up

918
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,800
security programs for automotive

919
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,310
companies there's a new standard being

920
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,710
released in 2020 as iso standard that's

921
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:52,700
going to work with OEMs and Tier one

922
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:54,020
suppliers which is promising essentially

923
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,629
it's going to show their due diligence

924
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,790
for security which right now it's a mess

925
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,220
there isn't a standard for cyber

926
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:03,340
security in the automotive space so

927
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,200
everyone's using their own frameworks

928
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:14,090
which you can imagine is like you know

929
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:16,730
developing your own crypto okay guys you

930
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:19,340
know wrap up if you have any questions

931
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,800
feel free to find me I'll be in the the

932
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,610
project showcase and thank you for your

933
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:29,079
time

934
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:29,079
[Applause]
