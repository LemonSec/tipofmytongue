1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,450
can I start hi everybody so my name is a

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:13,080
video I came from clues that that's a

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,088
place in Romania a city in Romania and

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,690
today we're going to be discussing

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,270
mainly about open source tools that you

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,220
can use to maybe build a cybersecurity

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,210
platform for your company or for you or

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,669
for for whoever needs that and one of

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,520
the things I'm gonna mention it that

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,410
it's gonna be all about open source it's

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,059
not going to be anything commercial so

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,269
the this is not a sales pitch or

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,919
anything and another thing I'm gonna

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,309
mention it's going to be very very

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,100
focused on either if you want to use or

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,230
not those tools within your company most

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,420
of the companies have none of them I

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,089
mean not even commercial not even open

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,940
source so you could start with the open

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,620
source one if they're not sufficient for

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,559
you and for your needs you can always

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,250
move to the commercial ones but at least

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,710
start with something so if you need any

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,049
of the tools you're gonna see here start

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,020
using them and move to the commercial

26
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,729
ones when they are not sufficient for

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,570
you and we're going to be covering

28
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,580
mostly what called the blue team or the

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,529
part that actually takes care of

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,470
securing the infrastructure at the

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,290
endpoint and not the part that that's

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:36,119
gonna take care of application security

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,939
or penetration testing or meronym all

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,799
these other areas for for security

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,048
within a company so this is me close

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,979
napoca is in transylvania I'm sure that

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,780
you know so I came from from a company

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,740
that develops endpoint protection and

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,290
data loss prevention

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,810
I moved from them now I'm working in a

41
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,380
British company in the industry royalty

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,409
sector we had some a different product

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,030
in in in the last years so that's cool

44
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,430
and we're going to be talking about

45
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,470
these areas within a cyber security

46
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,530
platform

47
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,520
there are many which are commercials and

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:22,310
they are great but for some companies

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,850
it's really expensive and we're talking

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,650
about maybe ten of thousands of years

51
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,450
dollars per month in terms of

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,490
subscription that's a lot for most of

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,920
the companies and the tools I'm going to

54
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,470
be presenting can be easily orchestrated

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,839
can be placed in queue Burnett these

56
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,000
clusters or any other type of clustering

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,170
system for for containers if you like

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,170
and you can use them to to build

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,720
scalable infrastructure for your cyber

60
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,519
security posture we're going to be

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,220
starting with nettle nettle protection

62
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,070
which is composed of various firewalls

63
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,680
intrusion detection systems intrusion

64
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,200
prevention systems traffic analyzers

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,710
everything that that goes into into this

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,959
area then we move to something which is

67
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,520
not quite powerful in the open source

68
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,820
space and that's unfortunately the

69
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,390
detection and response part this is take

70
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,810
more automated actions to to your

71
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,179
posture I'm going to be detailing some

72
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,580
threat intelligence feeds and what open

73
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,920
source and what can be used if you if

74
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,190
you is using non you should start using

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,910
those at least to get your insight

76
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,290
Margeaux analysis we have open source

77
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,160
sandboxes that you can use and those

78
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,950
hand boxes can be quite in handy in when

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,470
when you don't know or you don't want to

80
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,839
I don't know detonate a file within your

81
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,390
network or endpoint some college

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,519
security which is again not that's very

83
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,149
good in the open source space and I can

84
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,530
get that because it's so it has so much

85
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,320
traction at the moment the cloud

86
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,450
security part that the companies are

87
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,359
focusing on developing these tools and

88
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,220
most of the times they don't have the

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
resources to publish any open source

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,230
alternatives for it

91
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:19,040
and lastly ways to centralize all of the

92
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,500
data of the logs and what can you use to

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,650
make some sense out of all that data

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,470
which is a lot in

95
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:31,030
in in an IT department owning in a cloud

96
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:35,110
environment so network security which

97
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,369
can be I have a slide which has like 15

98
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,590
tools I'm going to be showing just a few

99
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,199
details some features based on them when

100
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,359
you're gonna look up on Google or on

101
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,810
github you're gonna find more tools that

102
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,560
you can use to scan your network or

103
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,470
stuff like that

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,190
we have pfSense this is probably the

105
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,860
most and and the best open source

106
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,350
security tool out there from my point of

107
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,510
view it has everything almost

108
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,370
it has intrusion detection based on

109
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:11,889
snort it has it has intrusion prevention

110
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,930
it has a quite good

111
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,690
through output for for the packet

112
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,250
filtering part so we can use this even

113
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,770
in you know in a more demanding

114
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,930
environment that requires good to output

115
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,180
of course they have commercial part and

116
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,280
if you want to go with the commercial

117
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,050
part you're going to get appliances very

118
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,570
big appliances with all the hardware

119
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,320
necessary to to have a good route put on

120
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:38,770
your on your network it has a firewall I

121
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,510
mean you can easily add this to your I

122
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,580
don't know to your home or to your small

123
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,599
office and have some firewall and

124
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:49,030
routing options for both comprehension

125
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:52,750
to the cloud so you can you can we can

126
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,340
add this rules to pull our axes based on

127
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,389
some restitution or some policies to

128
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:02,739
your cloud environment yeah then we have

129
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,330
Vic Vic was used to be called grow but

130
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,620
they didn't like the association with

131
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,150
with a big brother kind of stuff so they

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,240
recently I mean last year I think they

133
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,520
changed the name to Zeke but it's the

134
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,650
same platform it it's the same engine

135
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,740
the bro engine which is based on rules

136
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,960
and it's very very powerful if you're

137
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,300
going to try any of these tools you're

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,609
going to be amazed on how good they are

139
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,580
built and they're open source and most

140
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:34,350
of them is not like for example snort is

141
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,990
used in a lot of companies that

142
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,930
for commercial firewalls like sofas

143
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,270
sofas unified threat management have not

144
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,870
on the back end for all the ideas IPS

145
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,940
part which is it is a statement if you

146
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,580
use sofas you know that their product is

147
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,040
good the product has a suppose has this

148
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,840
on the back end

149
00:06:52,040 --> 00:07:00,750
also snort is backed up by Cisco Talos

150
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,869
during threat intelligence agency or

151
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,600
business is the one that maintains all

152
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,360
the rules the pop the rules the powerful

153
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:13,380
rules that are part of of snorts so

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,930
again that's a good sign that somebody

155
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,980
maintains these tools and they provide

156
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,260
very good people to do that think about

157
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,820
it they use it so they have to maintain

158
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:28,890
it in a good shape it has a lot of users

159
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,020
it has a lot of contributors on on

160
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,680
github so that's another good sign of

161
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,390
course there are also other tools in the

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,760
network security side you have a

163
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,310
next-generation firewall from untangle

164
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,240
if you heard of them again a good

165
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,280
product good compared to to peer sales

166
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,350
not that good from my point of view but

167
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,080
still a good product open-source product

168
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,590
you have mood wall which is afraid they

169
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,440
have a flooring and smooth wall has a

170
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:03,000
nice feature of content filtering by the

171
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:08,190
way I saw a lot of parents on on reddit

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,320
and on online they are using that to to

173
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,840
prevent bullying and stuff like that for

174
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,870
for their kids and it works so it

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,250
actually works and then you have some

176
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,650
open source web application firewall but

177
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,230
something that we most of us know which

178
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,929
is mode one security you add that to a

179
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:31,500
party you are a tree nginx or your web

180
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:34,549
server but it also has a nice web

181
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,659
interface I I didn't knew that before I

182
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,870
made the research for this presentation

183
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:42,270
but they have a very nice UI which is

184
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,180
open source so now it's easier to to

185
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,170
maintain or work with the rules they're

186
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,170
in more security

187
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:54,910
like north in Zeke you have ricotta

188
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:57,620
which is open source you have au sake

189
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,680
then for network analysis you have

190
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,390
Wireshark the the popular Wireshark and

191
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,849
which is a great and powerful tool you

192
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,360
can use still opens not open source but

193
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,850
they have version and for network or

194
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,260
endpoint visibility you have always

195
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:18,290
query from Facebook they use that to to

196
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,480
identify stuff within their if their

197
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,589
infrastructure but it's very good it has

198
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,670
this sql-like syntax where you can just

199
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:31,400
select ID and name from computers or

200
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,790
servers and you can see what what's

201
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,890
there

202
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,500
it's what it works also I found out a

203
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,689
couple of days ago I've been attending a

204
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,940
training and I found out that it works

205
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,070
also for containers in their native

206
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,260
environment so with environment if

207
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,600
you're using those again you should look

208
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,319
into a OS query which is open source by

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,340
Facebook moving next incident management

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,520
team responds this is not that well

211
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,410
developed or it has not such a great

212
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,189
presence like the network security part

213
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,579
but you do have tools you can and you

214
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,530
should go there and inspect to see if

215
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,900
they fit your needs like I said there

216
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,030
are so many companies that have none of

217
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,670
these tools in place they don't have the

218
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,230
commercials one so they could at least

219
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,709
sort start with something and

220
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,090
open-source part is good to start with

221
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,390
when you need it when your customers

222
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,490
required you can move it you can move to

223
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:31,130
commercial product which are more

224
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,920
powerful unfortunately but they come in

225
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,800
the price response many you have hive

226
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,630
and you have size one - I think it's

227
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,969
maintained by a very big security

228
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,510
company I don't I don't remember their

229
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,150
name but it's big so they are again well

230
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:51,620
maintained they offer you the options to

231
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:53,270
collect the data from from GM or from

232
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,180
data loss prevention system lankan

233
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,949
protection firewalls make some alerts

234
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,890
based on that you have the options to

235
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,080
collaborate within within teams so

236
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,110
everybody can can go there and look at

237
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,000
the and the incident they were they were

238
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:12,620
found within their infrastructure their

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,590
network you have ticketing I think yeah

240
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,250
hive has ticketing system like a service

241
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:22,430
now feature but within the hive you

242
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,010
could easily use that to to track and to

243
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,150
make sure the teams get the work done

244
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:31,640
when incidents occur there must be other

245
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,400
tools there I haven't found any that

246
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,120
compared to this tool so these are quite

247
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,470
mature

248
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:42,110
psyphon it it uses a docker file to to

249
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,520
deploy so it's easy to install that in

250
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:49,070
any server or in a form of server

251
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,600
servers and you could easily scale that

252
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,450
to meet your needs

253
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,910
so it's containerized it's contained now

254
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,910
ready it's super easy to use you just

255
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:02,030
have to dock and compose up attend and

256
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:04,520
that's it ok

257
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,370
cyber threat intelligence feeds this is

258
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:10,579
very important when you want to stay up

259
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,400
to date with with the threat you cannot

260
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,560
as a human being or a team of human

261
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,400
beings you cannot follow everything you

262
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:25,069
don't have either have the power to do

263
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:27,050
that so you should always subscribe to

264
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,510
some of the security feeds which are

265
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,979
public they are maintained they have

266
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:36,740
daily update you you can simply search

267
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,500
for more than than what here you have

268
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,540
the one from alien vault with I think it

269
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,060
was the first open source one and then

270
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,790
people tried started following this

271
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,859
approach because it's easier to gain the

272
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,459
crowd to get the crowd to maintain your

273
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:56,210
list then you to do it so this crowd

274
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:59,870
like approach is very effective we have

275
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:02,839
major security vendors that have open

276
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:06,200
source product just to get the crowd the

277
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,450
people the contributors in their network

278
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,790
so they can make use of all this shared

279
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,610
knowledge which is again a benefit for

280
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,760
everybody not just for the vendors

281
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,830
you have threaded which is a list of

282
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,140
public lists you have a github

283
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,690
repository which maintains a lot of I

284
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,030
have no space to list all of that from

285
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:32,180
from often threat intelligence it's a

286
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:34,699
list of 5060 sources that you can look

287
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,280
at you won't be able to use all of them

288
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,760
but use some which you notice that are

289
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,060
updated that are reliable they don't go

290
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,340
down you can use those to to take your

291
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:50,300
insights for for your platforms or for

292
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:52,130
your teams there's another one your

293
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,469
everyday trait intelligence that's not a

294
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:58,160
very inspired name but it is and it has

295
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:00,890
features like this this analysis of an

296
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,170
attack or over source where it

297
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,390
originated how it how it traveled

298
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,959
throughout the internet and how they did

299
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,660
which may be your company who how did it

300
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,530
enter in within your infrastructure

301
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,800
maybe a phishing attack maybe I don't

302
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:21,740
know some malware some some some porn

303
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,170
site I know you can you can try to find

304
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,480
out how you were infected if you were

305
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,420
infected maybe you can find it here just

306
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,070
go out there and look for the for the

307
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,189
stuff that's available within the

308
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,740
platform okay

309
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,510
malware analysis this is a big thing I

310
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,900
mean I don't know how many of you

311
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,920
actually know about this technique but

312
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,439
it's very important because companies

313
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,479
cannot afford to test stuff on I don't

314
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,140
know a developer standpoint or even on a

315
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,510
security engineers end point if you do

316
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,569
that you're most likely going to end up

317
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,819
hacked or or tricked into something so

318
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,400
don't do that on your own end point

319
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,010
don't do that on any of the companies

320
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,410
end point which is not designated for

321
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:13,939
that and by that I mean it has all the

322
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,620
security in place to not escalate within

323
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,910
your within your network so keep it

324
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:23,360
isolated make use of the offering within

325
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:28,249
this these tools

326
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:31,100
but don't don't get it out in in your

327
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:33,439
company Yara Yara is used by a lot of

328
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,439
companies I had no clue that it's so

329
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:41,269
popular actually it it's a tool to match

330
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:44,089
signature-based threat and I think also

331
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,670
some other type of identification for

332
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:48,049
for malware and it healed by CrowdStrike

333
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,360
which is a big company

334
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:53,179
it's used by Raytheon which is a very

335
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:57,019
big government contractor within the US

336
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:59,089
and probably not only semantic and web

337
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:03,290
science those are I think the same

338
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:06,889
company now and LBM be Airbnb has a nice

339
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:10,129
feature which is free on github it's

340
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:13,699
called binary binary Alert is that it's

341
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:16,999
a cool product that you can use to

342
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:19,519
search for malware on your systems on on

343
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,939
your network or endpoint and I encourage

344
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,970
you to do that also for marvel analysis

345
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:29,029
you have this tool which is a sandbox so

346
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:32,139
you can actually get an attachment from

347
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:38,689
your from your email and drop it there

348
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:40,999
it will most likely be marked as a

349
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,849
threat if you don't know that sender

350
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:46,160
even if you don't trust it and you want

351
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,949
to see what's there you can use your

352
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,309
sandbox and endpoint to to detonate that

353
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:54,498
file and see what's inside so I

354
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:57,410
encourage you to do that this way and

355
00:16:54,499 --> 00:17:00,259
not after you open the file or your

356
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,059
company employee or your call it open

357
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,399
the file if you're in position within

358
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,279
your company so this is a great tool I

359
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:11,539
used it and I noticed its signature

360
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:16,339
based so there are lots of field threat

361
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:19,699
states that have che one or in in the

362
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,250
file sums of files and files with known

363
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,870
threats so they're checking against all

364
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,569
of that but they also provide some

365
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,059
insights on on the file itself so that

366
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:32,360
from malware analysis cloud security

367
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,309
cloud security like I said is not that

368
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,490
well recovered within the open source

369
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,500
base and

370
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:42,840
I get that it's new it's it's a hype

371
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,280
everybody one cloud security now there

372
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,909
are companies that are offering cloud

373
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,129
security most of them being being paid

374
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,060
companies commercial companies but we

375
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:56,220
have these players which are very very

376
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,810
open-source friendly T we have twist

377
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,130
lock twist lock with which I think it's

378
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:05,669
a Israeli company so it's here okay

379
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,850
since yesterday also pure sake it's a

380
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:11,670
Palo Alto no no but they have this cool

381
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,570
cloud discovery I tested it it works

382
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:17,610
it's okay they have these pools where

383
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:20,909
they fetch an inventory of all your

384
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:24,149
cloud assets they provide some security

385
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:28,140
posture on those cloud environment there

386
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:33,900
is scanning for like like AWS config for

387
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:36,660
for any unsecured resources or access

388
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,380
management which is done wrong and not

389
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,560
the way AWS recommends it through their

390
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,260
sees CIA's framework or well

391
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,300
architecture framework it has some

392
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,610
compliance I don't know if it opens so I

393
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,389
haven't get that to that to check if

394
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,649
their compliance part is open-source I

395
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,350
saw that screenshot on their web page

396
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,190
probably it is I don't know for sure but

397
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:04,590
you can try it out and you you can make

398
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,520
use of these features for a lot of

399
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,889
serverless

400
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,780
and kubernetes infrastructures with

401
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,040
which is again a great way of starting

402
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,660
analyzing your security posture within

403
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,520
the cloud environments so do that as

404
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,590
well for for your cloud if you're using

405
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,660
multi cloud environments again you

406
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,060
definitely need to get a grip on all

407
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,610
those resources you can do that starting

408
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,610
with open source tools if they're not

409
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,550
sufficient go with with twist lock go

410
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,800
with aquatek there are lots of companies

411
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,590
that do call security

412
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:42,540
like our colleague here mentioned they

413
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:44,040
get bought very quickly I mean because

414
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,830
they do a good stuff for for the

415
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,180
security part okay so we covered cloud

416
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,800
security

417
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:55,650
what else yeah lot management and data

418
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,740
analysis and compliance management and

419
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:03,120
policy enforce enforcing dad something

420
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:06,480
again which is not that well within

421
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,780
within the open source space you have I

422
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,510
think this one comes from apart Metron

423
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,750
if you know the platform it's a very

424
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:19,020
sophisticated platform open source that

425
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:22,950
has lots of Apache components on the

426
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,350
back end - oops Park to analyze and to

427
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,590
enrich the data from the network so it

428
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:32,010
relies on sensors to acquire the data

429
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:36,449
the telemetry from from your network and

430
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:39,360
your endpoint and based on the rules you

431
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,720
compose there it's gonna drive some some

432
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,389
insights some some analysis you're gonna

433
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,740
get them listed here you can inspect

434
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:52,110
them and maybe at some point you're

435
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,660
gonna notice some anomaly because at the

436
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,110
end that's what you're interested in to

437
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,380
find something that's not normal and to

438
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,780
alert the proper people within within

439
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,490
your team or your company to do

440
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,240
something about that anomaly because if

441
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:12,690
you don't know or they don't monitor the

442
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,440
network traffic the user behavior cloud

443
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,300
environment

444
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,310
if you don't monitor you don't start

445
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,120
with monitoring at least you're not

446
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,570
going to be able to protect yourself

447
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,629
like I was in the other room and

448
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,600
somebody from Microsoft said that they

449
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:34,950
have this mindset that they are already

450
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,850
breached and somebody is already inside

451
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,800
their network so they they bypassed

452
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,939
already the fact that we are not

453
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,940
breached let's do something since we are

454
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,420
let's try to have this knowledge

455
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,970
throughout the team's and let's try to

456
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:56,520
be prepared because we are breached

457
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,980
let's do something about that not if

458
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,900
we're gonna get breached

459
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,750
there's another tool which I found

460
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,930
recently it's a it's a very complex one

461
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:09,080
if you use it I don't know who uses it I

462
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:12,320
found it on github it's public but this

463
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,800
is cool because it has some features

464
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,100
that you cannot find anywhere it has the

465
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,139
spark and Jupiter hubs which is

466
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,260
something you can use in collaboration

467
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,080
with your team or teams and you can work

468
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,900
together to create machine learning

469
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,179
algorithms for the data all this

470
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,960
infrastructure collects so this is

471
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:40,250
haunting VLK it's based on elastic stack

472
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:44,420
and it has the screaming from Kafka it

473
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:48,440
integrates with with Hadoop analysis and

474
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,330
spark and it has another great feature

475
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,430
from my point of view again that was

476
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,490
something that she mentioned and I I

477
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:58,340
knew this quote is because defenders

478
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,670
always think in lists we always when

479
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,480
when we defend a company we put check

480
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:09,950
boxes ok we have a firewall we have an

481
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:13,730
intrusion detection system we did all by

482
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:16,100
the book for a I am and we say ok we're

483
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,890
secure but that's not the way hackers do

484
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,530
they think in Grasse most of the times

485
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,650
how can I get there and from there get

486
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,760
there and there and I can exploit that

487
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,630
so it's different

488
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,420
this tool has this grub frame which is a

489
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,060
graphing system that you can use with

490
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,850
the data maybe you reach in spark with

491
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,550
Jupiter so you can use that data to

492
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,379
create graphs and after you have that

493
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:47,870
and it makes sense for you as a company

494
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:50,660
to to notify somebody you can use also a

495
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,790
great tool which is the last alert so

496
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:57,650
you can easily send mails or connected

497
00:23:52,790 --> 00:24:00,080
to AWS no queue and the rest as tools so

498
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,720
you can easily easily make use of all

499
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,699
the tools available here what's great

500
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,240
about this feature is maintained about

501
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,530
this tool is is maintained and there are

502
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,640
plans to add voice query as well

503
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,930
the tools I mentioned earlier for

504
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,420
endpoint identification and

505
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:21,360
infrastructure analysis by querying data

506
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,880
like like in SQL just open the page one

507
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,179
on West query that IO and you will see

508
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:30,000
how easy it is to use SQLite playlist

509
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,280
for your network and it's gonna have

510
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,420
terraform integration support I don't

511
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,100
know what that gonna mean exactly so how

512
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,160
is that going to transform in a cool

513
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,350
feature but let's hope it does and by

514
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,560
that it's going to create cloud

515
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:51,330
formation or something like that that

516
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:54,230
could easily be forced on on the native

517
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:58,080
list account or something like that oh

518
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,430
hey I think that's pretty much it

519
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,790
I had this slide for another

520
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:05,810
presentation and I was like it would be

521
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:09,120
a shame not to have it here because it's

522
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:11,850
it's a good collection but it's not just

523
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,699
for for the blue team's this is again a

524
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:17,040
cool collection for for users also for

525
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,590
red teams but purple team as well down

526
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,840
on the on the devil sykov side you can

527
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,939
make use of all these open source tools

528
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,820
there are some which are not open source

529
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,700
but most of them are open source they're

530
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,879
great they have results we had the three

531
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,390
day three days training on dev say cobs

532
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,080
and most of the tools that I have listed

533
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:44,460
here a year ago were actually part of

534
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,340
that of that training and I noticed that

535
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,170
they actually produce good results for

536
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,750
your companies and for your company and

537
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:54,090
there are maintained so start using at

538
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,840
least those that make sense for you

539
00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:01,050
where you're at if you're in security

540
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,020
business that's it I'm going to be

541
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:07,260
thanking you and if we have time why not

542
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,820
we have time if we have time I can take

543
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,099
some questions for

544
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,099
[Applause]

545
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,709
so I haven't done nothing special but

546
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,430
stitching some parts here in my

547
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:27,770
description I said that I'm going to be

548
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,680
presenting the cybersecurity platform it

549
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:33,410
should have been most of the tools you

550
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,580
see here under one roof but we didn't

551
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,900
get the chance to do that unfortunately

552
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,639
so I'm apologizing somehow for that

553
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,270
follow me on LinkedIn because we have

554
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,980
implant to post something on github in

555
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:49,220
terms of open source platform for this

556
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:52,550
so it's going to be those tools and we

557
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,710
plan to have a feature like paid for my

558
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,560
intrusion prevention system check snort

559
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:00,080
or Zeke or whatever make sense put also

560
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,899
a firewall on top and maybe add

561
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,360
something for for the analysis part so

562
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:09,200
this is what we have implant to do post

563
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,929
as a either or a project or on github so

564
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,530
follow me for for more info in in the

565
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:20,600
future if you if you like to know so
