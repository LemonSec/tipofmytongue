1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,290
if you took about developers what do

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,960
really what do we really need from them

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:16,529
what we need the are we of course want

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,310
to developers to ask us questions about

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,480
typical vulnerabilities like excess or

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,729
accelerator and so on

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,670
we also warn developers to be aware

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,980
about security processes and controls

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:39,360
and of course it will be great if

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:43,290
developers simply reach our gates and to

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,140
make possible for them to help us and to

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,519
improve security in the products by

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,260
themselves because you know it's not

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:58,260
it's not a secret that in most companies

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:03,049
there are really a few people in

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,420
security team and of course almost every

17
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:11,340
company have developers and so on so

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:16,380
it's important to to many developers

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:20,280
helps themselves and it looks like we we

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,689
really want developers to be as to

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,180
become security hackers in case of

22
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:34,859
interest in security and different

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:38,720
stallion of how everything works there

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,720
is a problem in most cases

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,190
do they those developers are really know

26
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:54,950
if our team ever exists in company I

27
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:58,640
think that there are a lot of cases and

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,700
there are a lot of companies where some

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,400
developers simply doesn't know that oh

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,320
we have security guys we can ask them

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,050
for help they try to try to to make

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,859
decisions without any any consultation

33
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:20,260
with security team and after that there

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:24,770
is a problem so what we can do is it

35
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,679
let's take a look on typical typical the

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,280
first days of both new developer and

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,140
company of course the first stage is

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,120
some kind of interview and then we have

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:43,690
some kind of boot camp or welcome

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:47,320
meeting and and then begins a real work

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:51,650
begins with a cup of coffee or maybe a

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:55,130
lot of cups of coffee then do have the

43
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:59,810
first lines of code some kind of product

44
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:03,530
meeting or something like that and at

45
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:06,010
the end we have all we have the security

46
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,590
there we have some kind of security

47
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,440
review and of course the first security

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:20,350
issues and the code of this developer so

49
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:27,019
it's a problem let's let's let's sync

50
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:29,600
listen can we improve it and we need we

51
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,780
need to make more bridges between us and

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,250
to make more communications waste

53
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,470
between developers and security team

54
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:44,480
let's look more deeply in the first day

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:48,200
of typical of first typical developer

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,410
days in our company let's start from

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,089
welcome medium if you have welcomed

58
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,329
meeting in your company

59
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,020
it's very simple you can simply go there

60
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,820
and tell new employers about yourself

61
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,240
about security team

62
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:09,799
just five minutes and if you'll get it

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:13,910
will make a really really good result in

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,850
case of such a little time if you don't

65
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:21,140
have ever five minutes to go on every

66
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:23,510
welcome meeting simply ask some someone

67
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,090
owes some speaker all on this welcome

68
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:31,670
meeting to introduce security team for

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:36,280
new employers it's it's great if you

70
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:40,780
have internal internal staff portal

71
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:47,169
where all information about employers

72
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:51,109
can present it and if it's also great if

73
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:53,420
this internal security portal has API

74
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,260
because you know everything is better

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:01,640
than when you have a PR and you can

76
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:05,090
simply write some kind of Python style

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,729
python code or and simply monitor for

78
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:12,560
new developers presents in your company

79
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:15,620
and after you get some new ones you

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,990
simply can automatically send them a

81
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:24,950
welcome welcome letter from from

82
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:28,520

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,600
so on products but what's more important

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,859
we also try to write our secure ones so

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,620
please take this find some time and

88
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,620

help you in in security questions and

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,210
feel free to contact us sincerely your

93
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,210
product security team

94
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,210
obsolete

95
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:17,120
nowadays we have another collaboration

96
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,729
software tools and so on

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
like messengers so messengers is almost

98
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,270
everywhere

99
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,570
one of such corporate messengers is swag

100
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:29,770
and to give you a lot of opportunities

101
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:33,320
to communicate with your target audience

102
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:38,599
for example it's easy to create some

103
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:41,960
channels and the first one is for asking

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:46,820
questions is it's Stack Overflow

105
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:50,120
but in building in your messenger you

106
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,540
can promote this channel to developers

107
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,680
and it was it will be very easy for them

108
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,790
to ask you questions because you know

109
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,990
some kind people become lazy

110
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:08,570
another cool opportunity cool channel

111
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:12,410
it's new secured here it's convenient

112
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:15,080
way to propaganda or sorry to to make

113
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:19,460
more awareness about security about

114
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:22,609
security culture about news from from

115
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,900
this realm about new vulnerabilities and

116
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:31,840
so on and of course special special

117
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:35,739
updates from central security team and

118
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,599
it's it's a great place for that

119
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,900
another lots of things that you can use

120
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,720
in messenger assists of course some kind

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,789
of security bots which which can notify

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
you about new vulnerabilities and so on

123
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:53,240
and this boss also can notify developers

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,210
about new vulnerabilities in their squad

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,020
as they need to fix it as well as the

126
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,130
last one

127
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:07,099
our point is very simple - of Jeff has

128
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,250
some kind of loading screen messages and

129
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,860
slack also also has it so simply put

130
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,919
some important

131
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,190
light messages about security in it and

132
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,349
these messages will see every I will

133
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,759
repels on who will arrest out the slack

134
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:32,149
so it's very simple and let's take a

135
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:35,060
look on another important way to

136
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:40,328
communicate with with developers as you

137
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:42,380
can see is a simply back report in

138
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:46,939
bacteria called JIRA

139
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:50,269
what you can see here is on the top

140
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,750
there is a banner which we can use to

141
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:58,640
show to every developer and and as a

142
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:03,950
person who use your bug tracker and we

143
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:09,730
can promote security gates security

144
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:13,610
guides and almost our propaganda

145
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:17,720
security channel and slack but what is

146
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,140
important is not to make such such

147
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,870
promotion aggressive because you know

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:28,010
after such activities someone from

149
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:32,660
developers or maybe some some big part

150
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:36,529
of from from from them you'll take some

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:42,020
some bad feedback on with you and they

152
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:46,750
simply try to to ignore it in the future

153
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:50,230
so so please take and tension on it

154
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:54,320
another thing that we can see on this

155
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:58,130
screenshot as we use separate

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:02,770
vulnerability type for security issue

157
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:06,649
reports it's called vulnerability and

158
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:11,870
has red icon it's important because we

159
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:15,019
can increase visibility of security

160
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:18,420
issues to developers we almost can do

161
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:21,570
separate workflow for it

162
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:25,589
and of course it's important to make

163
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:31,829
security reports as much as possible

164
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:37,649
detailed you should provide steps to

165
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:40,410
reduce risk analysis and some kind some

166
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:47,880
kind of recommendations how to fix it

167
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:52,399
and but also all links from this tickets

168
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,399
should lead to your security guides

169
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:00,120
let's summarize today we have a lot of

170
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:04,500
channels which we can use to communicate

171
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:10,350
with developers most of most of them are

172
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:15,750
really simply to implement and next

173
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:21,360
let's talk in more detail in internal

174
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:25,550
security portal this portal is one of

175
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:30,029
the most important place of your various

176
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:34,469
power in your company so of course it

177
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:37,320
should be it should have short and the

178
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,970
easy to remember address and everybody

179
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:45,029
in your company should know about it we

180
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:49,560
can place here links to your security

181
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:54,000
guys Quick Links to self check and our

182
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:58,018
services as already mentioned it's it's

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,630
not a secret that right now in most

184
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:04,350
companies are really few people from

185
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,569
security team if in case of big number

186
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,920
of developers for example so it's very

187
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:16,349
important to make scalable self Chicken

188
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:20,959
services for them and that's all

189
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:24,509
on this portal you you can also place

190
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:30,559
contact information it's very important

191
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:34,319
part because as many opportunities to

192
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:41,129
contact with you you will have so you

193
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:44,939
will have convenient ways to developers

194
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:49,470
to find you to find you in email in

195
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:53,099
slack and so on of course as this portal

196
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,769
should be should looks active so you can

197
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:02,129
place some kind of security block in it

198
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:05,759
and what also as for me I think that

199
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:08,879
security should be visible and the

200
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:14,040
transparent company its we shouldn't

201
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:18,689
take secrets and shouldn't make secrets

202
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,819
from our projects so simply try to to

203
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:29,309
make visible your current projects to

204
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:33,479
talk all stuff and put links on it as a

205
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:36,600
real estate guides are very important

206
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,420
part it's a really bleak it's very

207
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,809
important breaking your awareness

208
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:47,878
problem so let's let's take a look on

209
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:53,899
how it can be done if the if we talk

210
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:57,589
about structure it's good to separate

211
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:02,399
guides for target audience like for

212
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:07,889
mobile developers for web and so on but

213
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:14,399
also you can put in some common topics

214
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:18,410
and of course some more kinetic part

215
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:23,069
about typical issues like overstocked em

216
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:24,160
it's a great idea to use some experience

217
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:28,449
from

218
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,449
press press and social medias for

219
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:36,400
example you can use some kind of cards

220
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:39,340
to do to show our information to you

221
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,150
developers it's it's a little convenient

222
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,490
way to show complex information you know

223
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,630
developers are also humans and they

224
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:55,140
don't like to read a long long grid

225
00:14:49,630 --> 00:15:00,250
articles so yes you should make it's

226
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:03,790
simply a shorter and easy to read in 10

227
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:07,180
or 15 minutes of course content should

228
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,329
be searchable because you know it's very

229
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,849
often situation when you have internal

230
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,690
knowledge base for example continues all

231
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:21,580
weekend and there's a lot of articles

232
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:25,660
about for example XSS innate and most of

233
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,810
them are outdated so it is be great if

234
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,910
all people who want to search for XSS in

235
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,400
your internal knowledge base will

236
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,719
navigate to your portal not to another

237
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:40,030
one and what else of course you should

238
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,490
integrate some kind of self check and

239
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,490
quizzes and feedback for minutes

240
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:58,100
if you talk about content you can start

241
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:01,279
from high high level best practices from

242
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:04,430
on vacation login input validation

243
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:11,660
output encoding and so on then you can

244
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:13,699
put some more specific stuff about sorry

245
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,719
about typical threats and mitigations

246
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:20,029
alike OS top 10 of us top 10 mobile of

247
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,279
course it will be great if you will put

248
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:24,680
some information about you internal

249
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,630
security processes for example how do

250
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:36,079
you manage vulnerabilities in your

251
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:39,709
company and it was important I know at

252
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,250
least two big companies where security

253
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:45,888
guys were prepared report from the

254
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,230
scratch so you know it takes a lot of

255
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:53,720
resources a lot of time to make a really

256
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:57,140
good security guide so these guys made

257
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,810
it from the scratch and I think that

258
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,199
there a lot of another companies which

259
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:08,448
are trying to make themselves

260
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:11,959
CQG guys so please don't make such

261
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,699
mistakes you don't need to write yet

262
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:19,699
another security guide from the scratch

263
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:24,319
because of ASP already made a really big

264
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,230
part of it for you for example if you

265
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,780
talk about Halliwell best practices

266
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:32,620
there is a really good documentation

267
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:36,230
project called hours per octave controls

268
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,860
another one or was tomten famous project

269
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:42,380
about typical security issues in

270
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:46,549
replication replications so you can

271
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:50,450
simply combine it and add some specific

272
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:52,610
specific things about the organization

273
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:57,520
or maybe technologies technologies which

274
00:17:52,610 --> 00:18:00,439
you are used and that's all you have

275
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,060
basically normal security guide which

276
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,860
you can which you can use

277
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:13,000
to educate your developers simply to

278
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,000
simply try existing projects from offers

279
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:20,990
every education process and curses

280
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:25,550
should have some kind of attestation or

281
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:29,930
test and it to help students so in our

282
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:38,480
case developers understand how well as I

283
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:41,950
know this course so it is so great to

284
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:46,160
have scripted tests and attestation or

285
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:49,490
Everman ever know which platform in your

286
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,820
company of course to measure of how the

287
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:56,300
routers really read the guides because

288
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,159
you can do it by by counting

289
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,810
vulnerabilities in the final stage but

290
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:08,030
it's more convenient to try to measure

291
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:12,020
simply by test results of course as I

292
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:15,350
said the authors don't like to read long

293
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,940
tweets and they don't like to pass a

294
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:22,310
really long test so your test your exam

295
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:26,210
should be should not takes a lot of time

296
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:29,090
to pass it and it it's very interesting

297
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:32,060
but it should it shouldn't be boring

298
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:36,020
because it's very popular situation when

299
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:40,730
you try to pass some survey or some exam

300
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,970
and on the middle of it you think all

301
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,630
right

302
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:48,620
I don't ever interested in it so it

303
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:52,400
should be it should takes a little of

304
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:56,600
time and it should not be doing and in

305
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,980
our days we have a really cool free

306
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,540
software projects like Moodle it's a

307
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,190
full-featured

308
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,420
learning management system which you can

309
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,600
use to make the ruler powerful courses

310
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,330
to develop

311
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,840
with additional materials with tests

312
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:19,679
with badges and so on so simply use it

313
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,590
and as a cool project it's for example a

314
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,260
vast security and knowledge framework

315
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:28,379
which give you not only opportunity to

316
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:32,430
use of as per application security

317
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,930
verification standard but also to to

318
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:40,470
teach your developers how to write

319
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:45,530
secure code in the final of such

320
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:49,050
education we will have some kind of

321
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:54,420
developer profile it's very important

322
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:57,659
because we can we can use it we can use

323
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:01,620
such profile to make some kind of

324
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,760
analytics in field of security of new

325
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:09,060
releases for example if new release or

326
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:16,230
maybe totally new product what's written

327
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:20,190
by was written by developers team who's

328
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:23,010
ever not passed any exams from from you

329
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,620
it's a good point to think that it

330
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:30,210
should it will not a really secure

331
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,520
product so the Lotus profile will help

332
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:38,780
you and will give you information about

333
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:41,450
it about developers who write the code

334
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:50,700
if you if talk more formal

335
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:52,740
there is a really cool and full feature

336
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,350
it the petition project from our squad

337
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,260
of a stone I hope everybody from you

338
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,719
knows about it and there is a section

339
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,080
needs and about education and guidance

340
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,520
which will help you to make some kind of

341
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,889
roadmap of your awareness program and

342
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,560
for example matrix from it we which we

343
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,410
cookin you can use is how many

344
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,110
developers through the route

345
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,750
CQG guides and it will be great if more

346
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:25,370
than half of your

347
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:28,820
simple rules for example and a less

348
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:31,820
formal metric is for example less

349
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,080
questions about typical issues in your

350
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:39,860
communication channels if you talk about

351
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:44,240
next big steps I want to put attention

352
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:47,689
in following steps and things

353
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,710
the first one is captures of like events

354
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:56,870
it's very very good for security culture

355
00:22:51,710 --> 00:23:00,020
and from our experience and simply boost

356
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:06,739
up interesting security in your company

357
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:09,049
in and a lot of percent security ninjas

358
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,330
and security security champions the

359
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:16,100
light of talks about it it's really a

360
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:22,990
cool opportunity and it's a really next

361
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:25,730
big step for you to make it takeaways

362
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,260
application security product security of

363
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,409
course should be closer to developers

364
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,890
from the first days of their work and it

365
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:36,230
will be great to help developers to make

366
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:41,360
secure applications and to make possible

367
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:45,140
for them help you in your duties and of

368
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,389
course let's let developers be executed

369
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,179
champions led them to be air hikers

370
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:57,080
security hackers and of course it should

371
00:23:50,179 --> 00:24:02,390
be farming it's my personal list for you

372
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,740
to watch on the nearest weekend or if it

373

will be great if you watch it with your

374
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:14,059
