1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,640
so I'm Kevin Cody and I'm here to talk

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,770
about mobile application privacy and

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:16,550
analytics so thank you all for joining

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:19,170
me so a little bit about me real quick

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,490
like I said I'm Kevin Kodiak have Cody

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,430
on Twitter I'm from Pittsburgh

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,538
Pennsylvania United States and I'm a

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,660
principal application security

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,269
consultant for a firm called envision or

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,110
an application security boutique firm

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,910
and I lead the OWASP Pittsburgh

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,589
Pennsylvania chapter so if you happen to

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,000
be in the area you want to stop stop by

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,379
one of our meetings always welcome so

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,640
what we want to cover today are some

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,410
well here are the goals objectives so we

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,750
want to talk about why we should care

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,120
about mobile and analytics and privacy

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,120
specific for our apps understand how

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,890
mobile analytics frameworks work discuss

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,019
the threats and types of data that are

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,159
at risk in our applications

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,490
break down how we as in users or bug

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,500
bounty hunters or internal security folk

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,059
or auditors or what-have-you

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,299
can actually start to peel back the

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,750
curtain on the mobile analytics SDKs or

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,820
runtime environments and yeah that's

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,920
that's it

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,139
so one thing that I like to point out

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,770
this is not a clap back at the Cambridge

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,869
analytic debacle I actually started

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,720
talking about this prior to that whole

34
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,759
thing so if that's what you came here

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,009
for I don't have any hot takes on

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
Cambridge analytic I think it kind of

37
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,630
speaks for itself but if we want to grab

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,009
a drink later at the networking event

39
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,179
you might get something out of me I'm

40
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,850
not sure but I don't have any inside

41
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,280
information that's just throw that out

42
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,990
at the front so this is what we're

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,869
trying to avoid though if you haven't

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,380
seen this already this is the epic

45
00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:00,719
rolling dumpster fire so you know this

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,130
takes the stationary dumpster fire up a

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,559
level so this is what we're trying to

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,800
avoid right we have mobile devices with

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,690
a bunch of sensitive data on it

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,410
and we don't want it to turn into the

51
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:14,600
rolling dumpster fire but I digress

52
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,180
in reality how many folks in the

53
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:22,609
audience are familiar with Imperium they

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:27,470
were the folks who anyone remember what

55
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:29,420
was the the big Android media zero days

56
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,970
that were out with the media codecs

57
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,220
drawn a blank anyway they're the company

58
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,850
who basically founded all of those and

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,500
wrote the tooling to find the the

60
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,960
Android zero days for the media codecs

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,880
and and the clickless route and all that

62
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,100
fun stuff well they're chief technology

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,530
officer at the time started digging into

64
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,450
mobile and analytics and advertising at

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,100
the same time I was developing this

66
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,079
content and he happened to throw out a

67
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,820
tweet and I thought it summed up the

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,230
content best and he just said he's

69
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,540
thinking into the mobile advertising and

70
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,760
data analytics and the more he dug the

71
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,739
less comfortable he felt about having a

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,859
smartphone and I think that echoes my

73
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,740
sediment 100% right and this is again

74
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:14,300
from from the chief technology officer

75
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:16,130
at the time of some serious mobile

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,110
wizardry I would just throw it out like

77
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,500
that and he's this is what he was saying

78
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,540
about mobile analytics so yeah that's

79
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,350
kind of where I fall too so just to kind

80
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,500
of gauge a little bit as far as the

81
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,030
folks we have here are you compliance

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,840
auditors just general info SEC folk

83
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:39,590
Radian okay Oh wasps members and

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,890
enthusiasts okay how about pen testers

85
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,610
bug bounty hunters pursuers all right

86
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,920
that's good

87
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,300
anyone just like yeah I don't you know

88
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,920
don't fall into any bucket or anything

89
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,120
but I just really care about privacy I

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,839
want to know how this whole thing works

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,000
okay cool well that's me too I mean I

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,790
probably fall into all of the buckets

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,510
but I would definitely say I just kind

94
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,790
of want to know how mobile privacy

95
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:09,560
pertains to our apps and what we can do

96
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:11,679
about it so just to be clear I'm gonna

97
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,910
focus a lot on analytics and it does

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,978
differ from advertising a wee bit so

99
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,389
analytics from Wikipedia is a discovery

100
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,858
interpretation and community

101
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,909
of meeting some patterns of data

102
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:28,248
especially areas in which recorded

103
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,990
information analytics relies on the

104
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:32,240
simultaneous application of statistics

105
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,249
computer programming operations so on

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,749
and so forth but let's really talk about

107
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:37,939
it so this is a screenshot of an

108
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,610
analytics dashboard right

109
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:42,830
so if you had an analytics engine

110
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,389
installed or embedded into an android

111
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,969
application this is the sort of thing

112
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,669
that you would actually see from the

113
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:51,319
business who embedded that right so it

114
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,830
might be a little bit unclear but at the

115
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:59,750
top there you can actually see the the

116
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:03,740
Java the Java source and the class that

117
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,229
this specific SDK is embedded to or is

118
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,460
looking drilling down into you can see

119
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,560
the types of devices that are running

120
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,029
this application you can see the

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,819
operating system right so there's a lot

122
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:17,150
of Android there it will tell you 74%

123
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:19,339
we're on Android 4 and smaller on

124
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,679
Android 5 and still some on Android 2

125
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:23,180
this is probably a little bit dated but

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
I wouldn't be surprised if you still saw

127
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,620
some of those versions in your

128
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,419
application right the interesting things

129
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,240
are the stuff at the bottom I'm not sure

130
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:36,229
if you can see that but that says 11.52

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:40,969
of the devices are rooted it says that

132
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:43,610
on average the devices have 7.1 2

133
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,669
gigabytes of free space available in the

134
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,199
application space which is interesting

135
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,990
it shows you how much free RAM on

136
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,899
average these these devices have tells

137
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,949
you how often the application was in

138
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:59,800
focus on that person's device and how

139
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,750
many what's the percentage that have

140
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,830
proximity turned on on their devices so

141
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,000
the first time I sold some of this

142
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,938
information I was a little taken aback

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,860
that's a lot of I wouldn't say personal

144
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:12,080
information but interesting information

145
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,639
that our developers and the business

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,438
that we use have on devices that you

147
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,569
might not know right off the bat like oh

148
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,120
I wonder I didn't know they knew how

149
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:27,279
much free space I had on my phone right

150
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:32,000
or how much RAM I have available right

151
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:33,710
but you know what you when looking at

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,800
this you might you might see here

153
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:43,130
that up at the top there is 38,000

154
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,630
non-fatal alerts and there's 10k users

155
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,550
right so that's the kind of information

156
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,620
that I think I would normally think of

157
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,650
you know actual kind of debugging

158
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,389
information or actual actionable

159
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,448
information that I would want to take

160
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,800
when a user has a problem and I'm trying

161
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,750
to get to the bottom of it or I'm trying

162
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,150
to see how many users are going to a

163
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,849
certain function or page of my

164
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:10,400
application so with that said I want to

165
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:12,770
get real for a moment there is a

166
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,120
legitimate business justification for

167
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:20,060
these analytics applications right IT

168
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,360
security compliance whoever you probably

169
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,740
work for in the organization your role

170
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,630
is there for the business you're there

171
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,370
to support the business without the

172
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,110
business you wouldn't have a security

173
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,330
role now if you're a developer you

174
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,220
probably are a little bit abstract from

175
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,469
this because you're providing more to

176
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,930
the bottom line directly but without

177
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,210
clients or customers we don't have

178
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,610
revenues without revenues we don't have

179
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,580
a business and insights click-throughs

180
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,080
Diagnostics debugging all of that helps

181
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,150
drive for the bottom line drive the

182
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,630
business if your security as a service

183
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:56,719
company that line is probably a little

184
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,300
bit more blurred but most folks work in

185
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,789
you know retail or banking or have a

186
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,590
service or have a product and all of

187
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,530
that information really helps drive and

188
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,210
get better details on how you can better

189
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,840
deliver whatever it is that you're doing

190
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,270
as a business to your end-users and

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,460
analytics is of course important if

192
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,698
you're trying to strive to provide

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,919
actual data better better insights into

194
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,930
marketing or better insights into your

195
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:29,330
development team for new products or

196
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:31,340
services or whatnot so the last thing

197
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,559
I'll say in regard to that is I'm

198
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,439
probably gonna name drop a few analytic

199
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,689
services right I'm not here to shame any

200
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,399
of them it's a legitimate business again

201
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,469
I've just used the last probably three

202
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,660
or four slides to show you that so if

203
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,279
you hear me name drop a specific

204
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,060
analytic service it's not because

205
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,950
they're bad it's not

206
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,449
they're doing anything wrong it's just

207
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,910
because I happen to see a lot of

208
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:56,060
analytic services on average how many

209
00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:00,949
analytic services do you think I see in

210
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,900
my consulting days right I consult on

211
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,080
application security specifically mobile

212
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,390
apps and I dig into the security how

213
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,850
many on average do you think a normal

214
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,020
say retail app how many analytic

215
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,010
services do you think they have embedded

216
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:18,350
just right a number under 30 is a little

217
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,840
high it's in the single digits but

218
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,850
that's thanks for starting this out

219
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:28,910
anyone else was that three I see three

220
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,280
or four is actually average which I was

221
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,439
surprised when I first saw that number

222
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,760
because you could probably get away with

223
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,830
one there pretty deeply integrated right

224
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,020
you might say okay well marketing wants

225
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,470
everything in Adobe so we threw on Adobe

226
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,630
on top of you know crashlytics or

227
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,540
something like that okay so that's two

228
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,880
but I'm not joking I see on average

229
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,010
three or four per application I've never

230
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,650
seen 30 but I have seen in the higher

231
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,900
single digits which still is shocking to

232
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,569
me because you pay a lot of money for

233
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,000
these services the licensing isn't cheap

234
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,640
the resources for your application

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,320
aren't cheap your user experience isn't

236
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,790
cheap because there's a lot of stuff

237
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,660
going on in the background to send this

238
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:16,969
data off right okay

239
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,490
so I've kind of hinted at this so far

240
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,360
how our analytics actually embedded into

241
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:27,080
our application so usually it's one of

242
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,420
two ways either JavaScript or an actual

243
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,890
SDK that's bundled in with our first

244
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,410
party app so if it's JavaScript and we

245
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,230
think if anyone was just here for the

246
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,360
last talk we talked about the JavaScript

247
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,980
top 10 right and I'm sure there's a lot

248
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,590
of JavaScript being thrown around today

249
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,150
javascript is powerful it's a powerful

250
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,750
language both client-side and

251
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:53,510
server-side but if you're embedding

252
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:58,120
third-party JavaScript into your first

253
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,120
party domain what can it do

254
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,170
everything right a lot it can new a lot

255
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,180
if you're not familiar with JavaScript

256
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,829
and and what it can do I would

257
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,569
definitely suggest to research on that

258
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,040
obviously everything that I just showed

259
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,450
you can all be done with a little

260
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,610
snippet of JavaScript so it's pretty

261
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:17,820
powerful and when you go to audit that

262
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,800
how much of that javascript is actually

263
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,630
dynamically generated and pulled down at

264
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,020
runtime versus what you're actually

265
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:30,880
embedding most likely a very large

266
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,710
percentage if not a great majority you

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,150
know like 80 90 % of that could be

268
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,440
dynamically pulled down at runtime so

269
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:40,240
you embed say 20 lines of JavaScript and

270
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,650
then it starts pulling down pulling down

271
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,210
pulling down all of a sudden you know

272
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,890
there's hundreds of thousands of lines

273
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,530
of JavaScript that are actually being

274
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:51,069
executed so on the flip side of that you

275
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:54,120
can embed in SDK so you get an SDK it's

276
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:56,770
usually in the form of you know whatever

277
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,220
native code that you're writing in or if

278
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:03,189
you're using something like xamarin or

279
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,440
you know whatever write one type app and

280
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,440
deploy to multiple OSS or you decide to

281
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,160
use it can be bundled in that way as

282
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,260
well and pulled in as a library but when

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,870
it comes down to it our auditors

284
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,689
compliance security folks really going

285
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:23,050
further into a testing into that SDK or

286
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,820
the JavaScript outside of just getting a

287
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,280
certificate of attestation getting the

288
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,470
sign-off from procurement getting the

289
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,839
okay we're all good our teaser and

290
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:36,510
Caesar signed probably not and if you

291
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:42,700
are fantastic but I recommend doing that

292
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:44,800
all of the time for any new excuse me

293
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,800
any new analytics engines that are on

294
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,800
boarded and I say that because usually

295
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,750
security is not involved when new

296
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,449
analytics are pulled in it's usually a

297
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,600
business driver and it's and it's pulled

298
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,060
in due to some you know business context

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,460
and like I said marketing once something

300
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,099
from Adobe's marketing cloud they embed

301
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,640
a little you know few lines of

302
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,980
JavaScript and

303
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,380
I definitely recommend if you're not

304
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,180
familiar with what analytics engines are

305
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,700
being used in the applications that you

306
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,660
call your own I definitely suggest you

307
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,550
look at it so when I talk about data

308
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,769
that it's concerning that I've seen in

309
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,449
third-party analytics this is the kind

310
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:32,230
of stuff that I'm talking about keys

311
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:36,339
like full-on private TLS keys private

312
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:40,040
RSA keys etc session IDs I've seen full

313
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,839
HTTP responses and requests well I mean

314
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,610
that's actually pretty common if you

315
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,750
have you know analytics and debugging

316
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:50,959
turn 211 and you're just kind of getting

317
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,260
things sorted out or maybe you're you're

318
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,149
looking at a QA or test region app and

319
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,010
you don't quite have your feature

320
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,440
toggles in place and you accidentally

321
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,630
pushed a prod and all of a sudden you're

322
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,709
sending full HTTP requests and responses

323
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:09,230
to a third party right what what what is

324
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:11,089
unique about HTTP that would be

325
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:15,160
concerning if you are sending full

326
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:18,260
requests and responses to a third party

327
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,850
HTTP is a stateless protocol so what do

328
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,850
we have to have in all of our requests

329
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,050
exactly

330
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,469
he said credentials identity of people

331
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,589
session tokens headers cookies if

332
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:37,760
someone can get a session and header or

333
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:43,279
cookie what can they do everything there

334
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:45,620
you HTTP doesn't care HTTP says is this

335
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,480
person who they say they are I'm not a

336
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,500
stateful protocol they have everything

337
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,140
that I was expecting yes they are that

338
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,810
person right so if you're sending full

339
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,800
HTTP requests and responses to a third

340
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,939
party analytics vendor or a partner that

341
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,370
could be concerning depending the

342
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,430
security and how that's done I've seen

343
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,130
GPS coordinates very very precise GPS

344
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:14,300
coordinates down to the fifth or sixth

345
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:17,089
decimal place sent to third parties IP

346
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,069
addresses dns info router info that's

347
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,880
that's pretty common probably not the

348
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,670
most concerning thing

349
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,060
but of course if you skip down one folks

350
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,649
heard of this GT gdpr thing right it's a

351
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,339
little bit concerning we talked about

352
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:35,339
privacy and data well all of this stuff

353
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:39,270
definitely would fall under that of

354
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:41,670
course PII data and just credentials

355
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,449
just plain text you're doing everything

356
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,699
right

357
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:49,290
you're hashing you're you know

358
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,820
encrypting if you have to encrypt for

359
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:55,110
whatever reason you're doing everything

360
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,000
great but you have to send the password

361
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,529
we have to send the credential at some

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,760
point in time to be validated on the

363
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,380
server side unless you're doing some

364
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,029
client-side trickery which is it's just

365
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,459
interesting we can talk about that at a

366
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:10,050
different time and when you make that

367
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:12,449
post you actually sent that to a third

368
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,680
party and the clear and now that's being

369
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,970
logged there and everything you've done

370
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,099
to make sure that everything is

371
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,410
completely secure and safe and awesome

372
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:25,050
is now also being replicated somewhere

373
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:27,839
else and making everything move so this

374
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,579
is a good exchange on a one of those

375
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
popular analytics engines that I said I

376
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:36,420
wouldn't shame so I read acted this but

377
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,640
this is directly from their their boards

378
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,510
and the person's there so if you google

379
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,760
this you could probably figure it out

380
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,730
but I'll let you do that so this person

381
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,730
said what information does this redacted

382
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,760
in sentence store about the app when you

383
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,279
use their tool I'm just gonna summarize

384
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,700
this basically saying at a normal level

385
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,970
we collect app level data metadata app

386
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,920
name bundle ID iconic cetera et cetera

387
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,000
so we can distinguish your app within

388
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:10,309
the dashboard at the crash level there's

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,689
a lot more there crash reports right

390
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,089
we're trusted by many largest companies

391
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,470
Twitter square etc etc to protect their

392
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,280
data but let me know if you have any

393
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:24,170
specific questions so just to throw it

394
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:28,379
out there I think that's probably right

395
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,120
but do they mention any of these things

396
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,460
musi I can tell you I've seen every

397
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,840
single one of these multiple times in

398
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,169
real world applications that are out

399
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,168
there

400
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:38,759
market today and I he never mentioned

401
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:41,460
keys he never mentioned plaintext creds

402
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,820
he never mentioned GPS coordinates PII

403
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,980
data HIPAA data PCI data etc etc and

404
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,590
I've seen all of that in third-party

405
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,970
analytics engines so what I'm trying to

406
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,668
say here is that while this is

407
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,279
technically not wrong depending on how

408
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,739
you have it configured I would say that

409
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,249
this is probably not the typical state

410
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:04,320
for these analytics engines of course it

411
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,879
can be much less than what he's even

412
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,049
saying here or outside it's probably the

413
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,748
first the first thing right they

414
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:12,059
absolutely have to have the app ID

415
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:15,929
package bundle name icon that kind of

416
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:18,299
thing great but I've definitely seen

417
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:24,450
more detail than what is outlined here

418
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:26,220
outside of crash level debug so you

419
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,539
might be thinking so but what does

420
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,100
Google think about this or what does

421
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,330
Apple think about this right you have

422
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,309
these third parties who are collecting

423
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,580
all of this information about their

424
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,710
users and you know there might be a

425
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,830
concern that one of the operating

426
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,720
systems might say hey you're not getting

427
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,210
explicit consent from your users to

428
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,690
capture all of this data we don't want

429
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:51,389
you to send it to third parties right

430
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,210
well Apple did come out and change their

431
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:57,840
their legal verbiage this is back of May

432
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:00,450
last year and they said that apps are no

433
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,449
longer able to transmit location data of

434
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,549
users to third parties so you think that

435
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,399
that would include the analytics engines

436
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,918
but to be clear it does not analytics

437
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:13,080
are exempt from this statement so

438
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,749
because you're embedding to analytics in

439
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,080
your first party app they are considered

440
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:21,119
the first party app so there is nothing

441
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,389
from Apple's point of view or Google's

442
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,840
point of view there is no legal issue

443
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:31,498
with sending your user data as verbose

444
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,988
as you may want or not want to an

445
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:36,359
analytics firm or a third party your

446
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:38,639
expressively your expressly embedding

447
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:44,009
that analytics engine into your

448
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:46,080
application so this gets beyond that so

449
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:48,390
we talked about real-world risk

450
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,340
there was a good study done by app

451
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,980
thority again this is release last

452
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,270
spring and they looked at firebase

453
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,120
specifically are people familiar with

454
00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:03,450
firebase Google they're Google now so

455
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,550
firebase had an interesting issue there

456
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,100
was some type of debug flag or something

457
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,590
I included the link this article was

458
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,990
specifically from bleeping computer but

459
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,129
basically someone went through

460
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,160
applications that utilized firebase

461
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:21,840
embedded and looked at the security of

462
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:25,860
the cloud control panel for firebase to

463
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,389
see if they were properly enforcing

464
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,939
authentication on their firebase

465
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:33,390
instances and it found that there were

466
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:36,720
several thousand specifically twenty

467
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,700
eight thousand applications in total

468
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,950
most of those were Android twenty seven

469
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,220
thousand some were iOS a fraction of

470
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,740
that but they they connected and stored

471
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,820
data inside the the firebase backends

472
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:54,840
and out of that number of apps 2271

473
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,720
misconfigured their firebase instances

474
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,730
to allow them to be to be viewed from an

475
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,100
unauthenticated person so all of the

476
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,470
data that was being stored again

477
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,969
analytics type data was completely open

478
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,250
to the Internet and could be viewed by

479
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,130
anyone you just had to look in the right

480
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,630
place and what's interesting about

481
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:17,370
mobile applications that's different

482
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:20,160
from say web applications clients have

483
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,350
your code in their hands you can off you

484
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,720
skate it all you want you've probably

485
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,040
heard the term spaghetti code or code

486
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,930
off you station right you can do

487
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,090
whatever you can to try to hide what the

488
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,820
actual underlying code is but with

489
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,290
enough time effort an attacker would be

490
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,909
able to extract where this is coming

491
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,740
from and it's actually pretty easy to

492
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:43,110
see once you proxy the traffic so when

493
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,700
you're looking at your analytics and you

494
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,479
want to dig a little bit further these

495
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,360
are some questions that I would

496
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,640
recommend you ask do all of your

497
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,740
analytics engines offer to factor auth

498
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,370
so I'm talking when you actually go in

499
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,400
to view your clients data your app data

500
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:02,179
in their portal do

501
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,460
they offered to F a because you may

502
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,710
offer you may lock down you know you

503
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,600
Baqi everywhere but if your analytics

504
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,460
vendors aren't doing this that's

505
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,689
absolutely a place where an attacker is

506
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,580
going to focus do they offer SSO and the

507
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,290
ability to terminate the access of your

508
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,830
users or employees who have access to

509
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,300
that remotely on whatever your policy is

510
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,399
right you may do that

511
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,350
everywhere across the board but if they

512
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,190
don't offer SSO and they have a static

513
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,010
password in my analytics engine portal

514
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,380
and they walk out the door today and you

515
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,580
cut their access and you move on and

516
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,470
then fifteen days later they go to

517
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,840
access this portal and pull down all

518
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:46,250
your data it's gonna be open unless you

519
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:50,419
know to go in and terminate that user or

520
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,220
unless they do allow SSO support another

521
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,770
question does your security audit

522
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,450
compliance team even know what analytics

523
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,960
engines are actually embedded into your

524
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,130
application and finally do your

525
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:07,250
analytics engines have a stipulation

526
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:10,460
like do not as I do use do not use to

527
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,340
log sensitive health PCI GDP or whatever

528
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,050
whatever whatever because if they do

529
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,699
that's basically exonerating them if

530
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,090
anything bad would happen but most

531
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,470
likely they're not actually going in and

532
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,909
enforcing that right they're not looking

533
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,100
at the data you're putting in and saying

534
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,650
hey we don't want you to utilize our

535
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,909
service for XYZ data right that's a

536
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,500
level that they're not going to Aude it

537
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,900
again so if you're usually using that

538
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,990
and they're breached and you say hey you

539
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,310
were breached how are you you know you

540
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,600
were supposed to be protecting our data

541
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,220
they're gonna come back to you and say

542
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,230
hey you're not supposed to be logging

543
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:47,900
that type of data utilizing our service

544
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:50,300
okay so quickly here I want to talk

545
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,030
about a few things one prophylactic

546
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,070
measures if you're a user or abuser and

547
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,560
you don't want your information being

548
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,750
aggregated by these third parties you

549
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,940
can do a couple different things one I

550
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,920
would recommend not using federated

551
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,230
authentication services for applications

552
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,050
so log in with Facebook log in with

553
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,270
Twitter Linkedin etc there are some

554
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,110
definite security gains for utilizing

555
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,750
federated

556
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,250
but the aggregation of data and the

557
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,330
ability for analytics to start to

558
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:23,090
connect you or an attacker to connect to

559
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,289
you if there was ever a leak it's it's a

560
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,889
little bit more concerning if you

561
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:29,510
utilize federated off also you know just

562
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,399
be generally more aware based on what we

563
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,929
talked about today the applications

564
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,729
outside of maybe the application you

565
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:38,149
thought you're giving express consent to

566
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,919
might have your data and one thing you

567
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:42,168
can actually do it might break something

568
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,600
but if you were really concerned about

569
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,850
it you could try you could utilize some

570
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,610
traffic sink holing if you're not

571
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,990
familiar with like piehole or special

572
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,070
DNS you can actually either do it on the

573
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,620
device itself

574
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,019
utilizing a proxy or like a Android you

575
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,029
could modify Etsy host or whatnot or you

576
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:02,299
could utilize a special DNS server like

577
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:03,559
something like piehole or something okay

578
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,450
so the last thing I wanted to hit on

579
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,740
really quickly before we wrap things up

580
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,419
is if you were a user abuser internal

581
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,570
security person what can you do to

582
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:16,789
actually dig in to this and start to see

583
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,500
what these third-party services are what

584
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:20,029
type of data they're collecting without

585
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,889
actually just going in and logging into

586
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:26,720
the console right so if you want to do

587
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:29,240
that I'd recommend using Berbers app or

588
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,210
or what not a jailbroken or rooted

589
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,840
device if possible of course like SSH

590
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:38,059
SCP ADB etc Wireshark or pcaps

591
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,649
and then Frieda if you're not familiar

592
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:40,549
with free to grab me out of the stock I

593
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:43,518
could talk to you a little bit more

594
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:46,340
about Frida and objection or codeshare

595
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,019
and free dump free dump is the ability

596
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,189
to dump memory from from the device

597
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:54,559
using a Frida script specifically with

598
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,049
burp use like the JSON beautifier

599
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,580
plug-in is always nice decompressor a

600
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:01,429
lot of the analytics will actually

601
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,678
compress the payloads using gzip or you

602
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,669
know just zip so decompressor makes

603
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,340
things a little bit easier

604
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:10,730
of course filter search regex using

605
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,620
decoders specifically this is what I

606
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,320
wanted to point out if you're a tester

607
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,779
or you're at testing to something make

608
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,730
sure you're not clicking this when burp

609
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:21,710
throws up do you want to disregard

610
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,600
things that are outside of scope because

611
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,550
most likely your analytics is not going

612
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,990
to be in the scope of the

613
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,960
first party app that you're looking at

614
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,620
so if you go into burp and check this as

615
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,120
an approximate send items to proxy

616
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,830
history or other burp tools without a

617
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,659
scope make sure that's not clicked or

618
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,110
you're gonna completely miss everything

619
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:43,690
that I just talked about

620
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,010
so last few things so a couple hurdles

621
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,020
when you're looking at this of course is

622
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,600
off you see a ssin compression

623
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,629
encryption and knowing what data is

624
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,209
sensitive and just knowing that it's

625
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,010
labor-intensive to know what data is is

626
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,100
sensitive right a scanning tool isn't

627
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:02,530
gonna pick this up it might flag a

628
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,570
credit card number a pan a my flag a

629
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,700
social security number or driver's

630
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:10,800
license or passport or something like

631
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:13,780
that but context is king and only you

632
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,220
the auditor or compliance or pen test or

633
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,990
a bug binding person are really gonna be

634
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:22,180
able to look and say you know what that

635
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,430
is actually sensitive data so trigger

636
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,950
the trade if you're actually trying to

637
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:30,370
map all this find all of this create new

638
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:33,880
accounts capture the flow of the account

639
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,520
creation use unique names IDs emails

640
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,070
during that process that way you can see

641
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,110
all of that traffic being generated log

642
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,500
out of the application and log back in

643
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:46,449
sometimes the analytics engines might

644
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,840
kick up when you actually log out and

645
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,890
then log back into the application

646
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,300
authenticate using federated services

647
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,560
again I said if you you're really

648
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,909
concerned about in your personal life

649
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,500
you might not want to use federated

650
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,750
services but you're trying to test

651
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,250
analytics and see what all is logged use

652
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,420
federated services along with local

653
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:06,190
accounts and capture device system logs

654
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,600
so so this is the last thing I'll open

655
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,140
it up for maybe one or two questions a

656
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,120
bit of time specifically this morning I

657
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,700
went out and downloaded the top that is

658
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,439
Israeli top 10 apps from the Google Play

659
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,240
Store and I just wanted to give you a

660
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,800

I'm not gonna shame them specifically

662
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,450

663
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:29,110
sent to third-party analytics verbs

664
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:32,050
specifically were GPS coordinates my

665
