1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,600
rapid strep modal prototyping okay how's

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,000
everyone doing wow what a great audience

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,530
huge groups of people I know they're all

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,269
gonna come in later on so I'm gonna be

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,879
happy about that okay my name is Jeffrey

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,340
Hill yes to to Mantic I founded this

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,859
company back in 2015 with the Express

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,630
person of purpose of helping out in the

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,680
problem of doing threat modeling now but

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,640
we're not going to talk about that today

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,259
what we're going to talk about we're

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,539
going to talk about a methodology which

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,220
I've created which speeds up threat

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,410
modeling called rapid threat model

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,000
prototyping it's a mouthful so I might

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,980
just refer to it as rtmp instead so

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,980
first of all it's uh it's Creative

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,779
Commons you guys can go to github you

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,148
can download the documents you can do

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,680
uploads you can help me out you can do

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,940
whatever you want with you can fork it

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,920
you can everything like that you want to

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,239
do but it's open source Who am I

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,129
how many people I think a few people

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,629
over here know who I am but who am i

26
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,280
well I mean I'm just a guy up here

27
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,930
talking but I have a few things that I

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,780
can give you that give me a bit of

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,720
background on this first of all in the

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,220
1990s I spent a lot of time going around

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,658
the world programming on various

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,030
projects and everything like that and

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,130
learning about how people program how

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,140
people screw up how I screw up that kind

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:21,929
of thing right there so I got a good

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,390
idea of how projects go nuclear in the

37
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,759
early 2000s I started with Microsoft

38
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,650
small software firm and about the same

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,150
time was when they started doing threat

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,040
modeling and Ernest there because Bill

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,110
Gates got really pissed off that he kept

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,600
on getting hacked and I love this idea

43
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,869
threat modeling what was this a way to

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,240
find out things wait a basically pain

45
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,579
test or hack an application before you

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,570
wrote any code how cool is that

47
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,689
well carried on and I spent five years

48
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,419
well nearly five years at visa in London

49
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,309
and I was the sole application security

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,810
guy right there which is kind of strange

51
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,360
because visa is a very big company

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,649
especially these in Europe and I did a

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,909
lot of this right here I did a lot of

54
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,820
work and I started refining the

55
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,320
technique that I now call rtmp you know

56
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,639
so I'm not calling it rapid threat model

57
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,970
prototyping because I'm gonna run out of

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,010
words pretty soon so now I'm the founder

59
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,629
of two two Mantic

60
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,370
you guys can see right there so if you

61
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,379
see that logo that's about the last time

62
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,110
you're gonna see that logo off we go

63
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,700
all right three points right here by the

64
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,989
way I'm going through puberty sorry

65
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,510
about this I blame you guys right here

66
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,160
for last night's dinner okay

67
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,109
so first of all we're gonna kind of go

68
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,849
over for you guys what is threat

69
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,739
modeling I mean let's get a show of

70
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,540
hands cool here knows what script

71
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,069
modeling is dense strip modeling a good

72
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,170
chunk of people great great so it's

73
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,429
gonna be pretty fast we're gonna kind of

74
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,750
go over the basics right here so I want

75
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,459
you guys to understand the basic

76
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,030
fundamentals of threat modeling after

77
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,620
that who all knows a gelora texture Oh

78
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,000
fewer people there all right we're gonna

79
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,680
talk about the concepts of agile

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,780
architecture and how we can fit that in

81
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,010
using threat modeling because that's

82
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,750
going to give us the final one right

83
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,349
here which is rapid threat model

84
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:07,959
prototyping oh and by the way who all

85
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:11,030
knows about software prototyping nobody

86
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:16,250
got you do it all the time it's called

87
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:18,319
agile all right so what should threat

88
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,660
modeling do right here's a big question

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,250
well it should talk about three things

90
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,269
right here so when you do threat

91
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,459
modeling you should be answering these

92
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,109
questions right here secure by design

93
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,290
you should be like looking at the fence

94
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:33,139
and depth and your models and your

95
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,510
designs you should take a look at that

96
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,160
and be able to defend themselves

97
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,410
especially in a microservices world all

98
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,709
right the second thing is is they should

99
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,410
be secure and they should fail to a more

100
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,060
secure State sorry a secure state so

101
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,709
certainly fails it should take the

102
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,930
principle of identity into account

103
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,799
everything inside the application should

104
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,900
have identity

105
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,790
there should be no anonymous whatsoever

106
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,260
and then second of all the principle of

107
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,690
least privilege don't give it more

108
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,709
privileged than it needs and the last

109
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,290
thing right here that we talked about

110
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,730
especially in the DevOps world is it

111
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,500
should be secure in deployment and there

112
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,388
are two concepts right there the first

113
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,370
point right here is know your endpoints

114
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:12,709
no one communicates inside and outside

115
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,019
how do you think in 2000 that Microsoft

116
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,760
got bitten so hard it was an open port

117
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:23,240
on an SQL Server how do you think that

118
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,719
Sony got attacked in 2010 it was an SQL

119
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,750
Server

120
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,100
it was an open endpoint this

121
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,960
second thing the bad guys do is they

122
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,100
look for communication protocols and

123
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
they basically exploit those

124
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,760
communication protocols if you know

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,289
those two parts right there you can

126
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,409
communicate to any person who's in

127
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,490
infrastructure and you can do it well

128
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,900
okay so those three things right here

129
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,130
that's the first point right here about

130
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,870
the threat modeling they certainly

131
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,950
should answer the second point the

132
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,480
threat modeling should answer is they

133
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,650
should understand and it should be able

134
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,140
to you should be able to explain

135
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,359
everything on that diagram via threat

136
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,070
modeling upper left-hand corner owners

137
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,360
who are the owners the owners are the

138
00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:01,390
stakeholders and they're your bosses the

139
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,620
people who lose our voices and there

140
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,890
were anybody who you work with on the

141
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,320
team all the way up to the CEO this the

142
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,729
owners they know what the assets are

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,630
right you should know what the assets

144
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,030
are you should understand what the

145
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,370
assets are in between you have the most

146
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,229
important parts of a threat level you

147
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,169
have vulnerabilities and threats

148
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,590
vulnerabilities are actual issues

149
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,719
threats are not fictitious but they're

150
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,500
potential issues they all feed in they

151
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,300
should have a one-to-one relationship

152
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,310
with countermeasures your threat model

153
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,950
should take care of that and the lower

154
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,380
left hand corner it's interesting about

155
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,570
threat agents because threat agents are

156
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,280
more or less relevant depending upon

157
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,750
what industry you're in I say let more

158
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,820
or less relevant because in the end

159
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,900
we're talking about threats and a threat

160
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,580
model is going to be measuring the

161
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,989
threats not the threat agents but they

162
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,430
should be important especially working

163
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,250
government or if you work in other

164
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,010
industries that deal with all sorts of

165
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,330
nefarious characters but in the end

166
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,710
rating are your threat model should take

167
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,419
care of all this and should answer all

168
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,510
these questions and fill this out by the

169
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,450
way that came in what 2005 and so very

170
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,130
old but it's still quite relevant now

171
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:09,010
okay threat modeling should also answer

172
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:12,070
the question of flaws versus bugs okay

173
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,200
folks because a threat model we'll talk

174
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,219
about your design your design is all

175
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,409
about flaws

176
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,960
okay the implementation issues are the

177
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,760
bugs right here if you answer that and

178
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,289
you work out the flaws it's a lot

179
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,180
cheaper because of flaws get built in

180
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,150
now now think about this though if you

181
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,910
build in a flaw and you implement that

182
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,560
perfectly every implementation you have

183
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,060
is gonna have that flaw and it's got

184
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,039
have dependencies based upon that flaw

185
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,590
it's gotta cost a lot of money to fix

186
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:43,000
that isn't it and a lot of time that's

187
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,380
threat modeling so good okay you guys

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,930
have seen this is Adam show stacks

189
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,100
little design right here I love it you

190
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,200
know it's like okay you start at the top

191
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,660
right there you model you you understand

192
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,700
the system is how many people here have

193
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,669
done threat models for groups where when

194
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,870
a whiteboard out then is the solution I

195
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,520
think this a number of times ago I've

196
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,990
never seen it that way but you've never

197
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,789
drawn it out because a lot of times

198
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,100
agile teams don't do that anymore they

199
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,960
don't draw out their solutions and I

200
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,700
gotta tell you that's just that makes me

201
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,020
worried if they don't know what how

202
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,880
their solutions are connected up or how

203
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,430
they you know can visualize them that's

204
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,500
very dangerous indeed but you want to

205
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,790
model out your solution and you want to

206
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,169
look at your dependencies which are

207
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,570
externally interactors with your

208
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,789
solution your solution defense bond and

209
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,950
you want to understand how your solution

210
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,479
is built up in terms of trust what areas

211
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,310
do you have to trust more what areas you

212
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,440
have to trust less once you finish with

213
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,940
that you start analyzing the threats so

214
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,090
we use a threat framework who all here

215
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:42,280
uses stride and show of hands okay

216
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:44,619
who all here uses a loss top 10 okay who

217
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,080
all here uses open Sam what you can do

218
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,870
but well here des use open cengiz for

219
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,710
generic use reasons a few hands okay all

220
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:57,120
right besom excuse me fewer we're

221
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,530
getting fewer fewer security frame

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,180
crickets chirping okay no problem you

223
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,890
can look it up but anyways what you do

224
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,300
is you find a threat framework and you

225
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,340
use that framework and you become

226
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,979
consistent with it you use it throughout

227
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,599
your threat modeling activity and you

228
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,039
look for security control mismatches

229
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,389
because ultimately what is the goal of

230
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,340
the threat model ultimately it's not to

231
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,470
find the threats is to find the controls

232
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,150
the mitigations you want I mean because

233
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,860
we're in the business not of discovering

234
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,909
threats unless you're an attacker we're

235
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,770
in the business of getting there and

236
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,440
fixing this stuff before it gets put

237
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,090
into code therefore my opinion is our

238
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,580
business is is to find those security

239
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,699
code control mismatches and to get them

240
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,319
put into the design then you go through

241
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,000
your analyzer mitigations and you can do

242
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,789
one of two different ways you can either

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,279
accept it which to be honest a lot of

244
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,529
our business managers do yeah sure we'll

245
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,330
accept it or you can reduce whatever

246
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,330
that issue is which is what we want to

247
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,440
do in this room right here and you do

248
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,580
that by looking at your security

249
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,740
requirements or

250
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,630
your security objectives or your

251
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,280
security framework or whatever it is and

252
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,330
you look at that security framework and

253
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,310
say okay how am I going to go about

254
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,500
reducing this now you may have an

255
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,630
in-house set of security requirements

256
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,730
you may use an OAuth set of security

257
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,960
requirements I don't care how whatever

258
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,510
fits for you whatever fits for your

259
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,640
teams right so finally the last part

260
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,720
here is validating now in in a DevOps

261
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
environment this work becomes

262
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,540
problematic because if you do this this

263
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,099
is a very waterfall II thing right here

264
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,410
and you've about validating it you do

265
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,610
static code review and testing you don't

266
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,680
want to get that done too late do you

267
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,760
you want to get that done on time so

268
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,650
that they can actually get that into the

269
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,180
code so here's I want to get a show of

270
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,470
hands of people well actually I'm

271
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,500
jumping ahead of myself so let's go to

272
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,840
the next one how does traditional threat

273
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,550
modeling fail us okay so show of hands

274
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,160
of people is you start a threat model

275
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,359
team starts arguing you kind of get

276
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,680
finished of this rep model but you don't

277
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,150
get finished you keep on working on it

278
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,579
the threat mile kind of bleeds along and

279
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,650
you're already in sprint to show of

280
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,660
hands when it's happened quite a few

281
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,640
people right kind of annoying isn't it

282
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,600
especially the fact that you're after

283
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,370
you're trying to work it and then you

284
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,170
get busy because we're all busy people

285
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,850
and you can't update that threat model

286
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,490
oh man this starts getting really

287
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,780
annoying okay so too much time spent

288
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,690
discussing threats and not enough time

289
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,920
spent on discussing the mitigations how

290
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,730
many a show of hands again is how many

291
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,819
people have you gotten it's like

292
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,440
arguments in a room you may be tired

293
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,600
it may be windowless like this your

294
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,310
conditioners failed okay you don't have

295
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,660
any water you're annoyed and these

296
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,250
people are arguing you about like that

297
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,500
the threat that'll happen if a blue

298
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,650
elephant falls through the roof and

299
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,060
you're going what and your argue with

300
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,079
the person they said oh no no we want to

301
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,670
know that threat we want to know what

302
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,020
that and you never get to the mitigation

303
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,880
that's that that's a good part of the

304
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,680
story that's what you want to get to is

305
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,810
the mitigations so problem number one

306
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,849
problem number two dataflow diagrams I

307
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,849
used to love them now I don't love them

308
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,130
so much okay they look like this they

309
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,510
can look a lot worse you've got trust

310
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,220
boundaries and kind of slice between

311
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,500
things and you kind of say like well

312
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,910
okay I've got four or five different

313
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,280
trust boundaries coming over coming over

314
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,020
the place but I don't know what is a

315
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,670
higher level of trust and other things

316
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,960
and I get things screwed up and I don't

317
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,770
know it starts become really messy and

318
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,890
then I deal with the request response on

319
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,720
the flows

320
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,510
okay all right here's a question for you

321
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,709
guys what's more important to you a

322
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,459
request for response what's more

323
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,149
dangerous to you

324
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,670
show of hands request show of hands

325
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,589
response why do you think response is

326
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,089
response is actually I would make an

327
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,410
argument the request is more dangerous

328
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,750
of the two because if I'm an attacker

329
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,899
and I attack the request I'm attacking

330
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,089
the command I can get any response I

331
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,950
want if I'm an attacker I can always get

332
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,110
the response but if I want to slow down

333
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,510
or if I want to mitigate an attack

334
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,339
I go and I mitigate that request I

335
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,230
protect that request right there as

336
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,940
opposed to response and by doing that I

337
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,680
probably will requite protect the

338
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,850
response to because I'll create a

339
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,349
single-channel right there

340
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:50,720
TLS for example okay coo-all seem

341
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,910
something like this this is where we

342
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,470
gets really interesting

343
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,550
does that do you think that that thing

344
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,300
reflects what the underlying

345
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,969
architecture is probably not probably

346
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,979
some guy has been stressed out did that

347
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,740
one yeah check it out right there it's

348
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,449
my data flow diagram and the architect

349
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,790
exam goes like what the hell is that

350
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,560
and a problem is now you've got the DFT

351
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,449
not looking like the architecture and

352
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,399
they get out of sync and you get out of

353
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:17,930
time and you don't go back and visit

354
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,339
this thing until three to three months

355
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,010
later they've gone through a number of

356
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,600
sprints they have an architecture it

357
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,939
doesn't look anything like this you're

358
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,649
basically your threat models because so

359
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,510
out of whack right now it's useless and

360
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,149
you got to start over again we don't

361
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,240
want to get to that point okay oh and

362
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:38,240
this right here you need one of us

363
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,079
involved okay you can jump it on to the

364
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,399
security champions if you have any okay

365
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,569
they might understand some of this stuff

366
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,860
but you end up getting involved every

367
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,690
time and you end up having to get a lot

368
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,690
of hands and you end up doing this

369
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,550
running out of time so how many people

370
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,220
have continuously run out of time when

371
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,410
doing threat models show of hands again

372
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,339
yeah we'd love it we all love it that's

373
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,569
where you're sitting here right here and

374
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,220
you're listening to me babble on about

375
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,170
this we love doing threat modeling the

376
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,940
problem is we have that issue with time

377
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:10,189
okay and then you come to this you come

378
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,560
to the final sprint you're out of time

379
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:16,900
your threat models out of whack it's

380
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,089
kind of useless and you just screwed up

381
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,529
okay and you've allowed floss to get

382
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,890
into the system which you don't want to

383
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,110
do one of the problems actually before I

384
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,930
go further is because we we focus on

385
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,610
this as it's as group we say like we got

386
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,699
to make that threat model complete isn't

387
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,000
that isn't that that idea go back to old

388
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,220
water fail methods Waterfall used to be

389
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,170
all about doing designs to the ends

390
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,820
degree where you get everything complete

391
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,740
how many people work for a large company

392
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,330
here or have work for a large company

393
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,320
almost everybody right and you know the

394
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,120
whole thing about the large companies

395
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,410
used to be and still is is they get

396
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,940
these security requirements if these

397
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,439
requirements need to the nth degree of

398
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,089
their requirements and then they require

399
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,370
more requirements and requirements for

400
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:00,010
requirements etc etc etc until it's so

401
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,110
complete that they've missed the boat

402
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,580
anyways and the products already shipped

403
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,540
we don't want to get that way throughout

404
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,550
modeling okay

405
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,079
drought modeling is supposed to be a way

406
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,270
of getting there it's supposed to tell a

407
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,250
story so how are we gonna do that we're

408
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,500
gonna use agile architecture first point

409
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,200
right here are you guys familiar with

410
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,420
this for show of hands some people are

411
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,500
okay this is actually I mean I know it's

412
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,670
kind of vague and I think it's actually

413
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,650
very powerful because you can talk to

414
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,910
business with this on the left hand side

415
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,680
you can say to the business you guys are

416
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,089
responsible for this on the right hand

417
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,829
side you can talk to your architects you

418
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,140
say you're responsible for this you're a

419
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,150
strategic architecture right you're

420
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,250
responsible for consistency you're

421
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,839
responsible for providing patterns to us

422
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,520
when you provide the patterns and

423
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,050
frameworks we can then work with them to

424
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:46,839
create secure patterns and secure

425
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:48,729
frameworks then you have the second part

426
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,800
of agile architecture which is called

427
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,570
emergent design they see a more organic

428
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,949
approach right here now I've circled

429
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,540
model storming because that's kind of

430
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,650
the most important part of it but you

431
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,849
can look at every one of these things

432
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,319
you can say threat modeling should touch

433
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,140
on every one of these issues right here

434
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,910
stakeholder participation correct okay

435
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,890
what are prioritised requirements

436
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,740
prioritized security requirements yeah

437
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,850
what about multiple models if you wanted

438
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,410
to simulate different things

439
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,910
you want to be able to do multiple

440
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,400
models don't you the problem is we don't

441
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,560
get enough time to you want the threat

442
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,110
model and the underlying to be a single

443
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:25,329
source of information etc etc etc these

444
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:26,260
things all tie together so we bring in

445
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm just going to talk briefly about

446
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,760
open Sam right here because I did a very

447
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,029
interesting talk with a bunch of

448
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,560
executives couple weeks ago and they

449
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,110
brought me in to basically scare the

450
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,849
hell out of them on security and I did

451
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,769
that I plied through flood at them like

452
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,940
I told mines gonna throw fun at them but

453
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,820
in addition I also give them a very

454
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,079
powerful tool I said I want you guys the

455
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,370
first half the first morning I'm going

456
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,630
to talk to you guys about fun I'm gonna

457
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,029
scare the hell out of you and then the

458
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,889
afternoon I want you guys to take all of

459
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,649
your your business objectives and I want

460
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:59,260
you to map them to these business

461
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:01,029
functions and open Sam and I gave a

462
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,399
brief description of the 12 functions

463
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,779
underneath the 12 categories so they

464
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,339
spent the afternoon and I said look I

465
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,800
said you're allowed three different ways

466
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,769
of categorizing this number a value of

467
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,250
three is it's got major effect of I of

468
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,079
two is got you know not a minor effect

469
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,240
and an invaluable one it's got a minimal

470
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,769
effect on this and once I gave me the

471
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,810
definition of all what these different

472
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,180
twelve items were they went through each

473
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,859
one of their ten business objectives and

474
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,459
they mapped that to that why is that

475
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,100
powerful

476
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:33,670
well dash knows because if you can start

477
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,949
speaking business by using security you

478
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,569
can then tell them what a flaw in a

479
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,849
threat model will mean to their business

480
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:41,620
objectives and won't you it's easy you

481
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,800
just mapped it out you can say look

482
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,420
threat assessment that's gonna die it's

483
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,880
gonna nuke your bottom line of

484
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,979
profitability you've already done the

485
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,449
work you know that because if you have

486
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,740
them do the work then they can follow

487
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:55,269
through that's my main thing about open

488
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,910
Sam I love it that's where you can use

489
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:59,709
that okay

490
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,209
rapid prototyping so here's an oath when

491
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,560
we bring in so we've got a gelareh tech

492
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:04,270
chure we've got no rapid prototype we

493
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,040
just sell for prototyping right and if

494
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,299
it's very useful because you have to

495
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,178
understand this - four points right

496
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,490
there get your basic requirements see

497
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,299
generally doing this rep model right

498
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,980
write up what kind of a design a

499
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,439
conceptual design take the conceptual

500
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,599
design test it threat modeling again

501
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,760
right poke holes in it and then revise

502
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,530
based upon your results do that three or

503
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,819
four times and you've got your threat

504
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,199
model and you better results in scrapped

505
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,909
model and you can put it in before you

506
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,290
get any code done do it during the

507
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,520
sprints and you can improve upon the

508
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:35,020
code as you're as you're building it

509
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,000
right rapid threat model prototyping is

510
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,158
all about three things a consistent

511
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,570
framework we're gonna do this again and

512
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,340
again and again across all sorts of

513
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,439
different things

514
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,030
repeatable process

515
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,590
I can repeat it I can do it like that

516
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,780
which means eventually I can do what I

517
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,100
can automate it because then I don't

518
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,760
have to now except I don't have that

519
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,260
much time

520
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,250
if I can automate it that means I can

521
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,830
spend more time doing other things

522
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,179
they're not writing up reports here's a

523
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,230
question who all here likes writing

524
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,730
reports yeah I thought so I was waiting

525
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,500
for one person raised her hand but no

526
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,600
okay and then the last part here's

527
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,220
measurable data because the problem we

528
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,289
have is if we don't have measurable data

529
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,940
how can we measure how efficient our

530
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,710
threat models become or how efficient

531
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,860
our designs become over the course of a

532
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,409
number of Sprint's right it's just

533
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,090
perfect for DevOps second parts were

534
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:23,850
here a threat model should start the

535
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,020
conversation not finish it so we

536
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,158
followed by the second part here you

537
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,679
guys are familiar with the 8020 rule

538
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,289
right Preta principle 20% of the effort

539
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,140
80% of the way and then you iterate the

540
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:36,690
rest of the way in 2013 to give you an

541
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,780
example Wired magazine had three

542
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:43,049
security professionals crack into a

543
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,399
hashed password database and the first

544
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,740
guy was given like one guy was given a

545
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,590
day then two days and three days so the

546
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,780
guy who did it in one day he cracked 60

547
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,760
or 75 percent of all the passwords right

548
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,399
there using the common methods the

549
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,610
second guy incrementally increased it to

550
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,500
85% a third guy did 90% okay so it shows

551
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,168
you that you get the most bang for the

552
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,640
buck in the initial iteration same thing

553
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:08,190
with this right here so don't make your

554
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,730
threat model comprehensive I'm telling

555
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,380
you right now

556
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,500
let it be kind of loose let it be

557
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,880
framework and iterate over it this is

558
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,809
where we come down into the DevOps F

559
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,309
sound I'm gonna walk through the next

560
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:18,658
thing right here is I'm going to go

561
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,760
through their various DevOps step so I'm

562
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:24,150
gonna map the threat modeling and the

563
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,460
rapid prototyping as I see it and I

564
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,140
would say stop me but I know we're

565
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,400
running low on time so I'm not gonna lie

566
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,570
like you stop I'm just gonna keep on

567
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,669
cranking away on this you can ask me

568
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,010
questions afterwards so let's start for

569
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:36,600
the first one I hear planning during the

570
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,250
planning part right here is where you

571
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,408
get together and you do model storming

572
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,850
usually sprint zero okay

573
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:44,669
you're about to kick off your

574
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,530
your-your-your production so you sit

575
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,179
down sprint zero you do some model

576
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,590
storming you talk with your architects

577
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:54,240
you get your initial diagram out there

578
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:59,110
right okay so when you do next

579
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:02,710
we use stride except for I don't like

580
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,209
the definition of repudiation try it's

581
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,220
plain that two people who've never heard

582
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,300
of security beforehand because then they

583
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,160
go like while he's smoothing

584
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,899
they were opposite of non spoofing and

585
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,490
then I get these arguments these people

586
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,440
so I got into a big discussion with a

587
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,390
number of my peers and I said actually

588
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,850
think about this repudiation in

589
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,710
actuality is a lack of authentication or

590
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,300
lack of integrity of data you know the

591
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,950
data doesn't exist or it's poor okay you

592
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,010
can attack the for example you can nuke

593
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,080
a log file or something like that and if

594
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,190
you don't have good indication well hell

595
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,020
I can charge in there and I can

596
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:39,520
repudiate I wasn't there wasn't me

597
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,050
- so that by doing that then I was able

598
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,210
to explain this and I was able to use oh

599
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,740
yeah I go back again but if you take a

600
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,210
look right here the interesting thing is

601
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,340
you start seeing all sorts of different

602
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,200
designs like that repudiation

603
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,419
combination of the other two up above

604
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,940
there kind of fits in well as you know

605
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,290
CIA fits in this too so not the guys

606
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,520
over in Langley but you know so you can

607
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,550
explain a lot of different things using

608
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,810
stri it's a very powerful tool okay so

609
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,480
the second part here during the model

610
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,940
stormy right here is that we then take

611
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,150
the threat model and we save the threat

612
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,650
model data in the diagrams okay or you

613
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,000
attach it to a guard diagram using a

614
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,560
spreadsheet or something like that you

615
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,170
associate it with the underlying

616
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,540
architecture you don't create a data

617
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,150
flow diagram use a process diagram or

618
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,260
context diagram big break right away now

619
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,310
you guys may shake your heads and go

620
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,750
like well we don't agree with that fine

621
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,520
use the data flow diagram if you wish

622
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm just trying to save you time okay so

623
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,220
you get something like this now this is

624
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,570
an actual project and the project you

625
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,090
see on the left-hand side right here is

626
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,429
you see a website which calls into an

627
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,020
API gateway same with third party house

628
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,340
call directly into the API gateway and

629
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,900
you have a number of micro services

630
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,280
sitting in between you have an uploader

631
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,470
service in a download of service the

632
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,300
uploader service will will upload data

633
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,250
whatever it is dump it into blob storage

634
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:57,010
and it'll send a message to the queue

635
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,780
mikheil then inform parsing data process

636
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,030
and analytics based upon what the third

637
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,060
party or the website say and they'll do

638
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,889
some stuff okay the analytics part right

639
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,030
there the micro process we'll call it

640
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,380
analysis rules

641
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,300
and then we'll fire that often and all

642
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,160
send results to the results data which

643
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,070
then the website or third party can pick

644
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,090
up using the downloader okay everyone

645
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,980
understand that it's pretty pretty

646
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,000
pretty simple pretty straightforward but

647
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,800
there are a lot of things are kind of

648
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,010
similar to this okay so the biggest

649
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,659
thing here is the middle part command

650
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,360
and control what we call elevation of

651
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,310
privilege how many of you if you look at

652
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,959
Stride and you say of the six elements

653
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,840
of stride what is the most dangerous

654
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,040
element of stride is it spoofing anyone

655
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,610
raids show of hands

656
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:46,149
is it tampering is a repudiation

657
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,209
information disclosure

658
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,340
it's an aisle service elevation of

659
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,720
privilege that's the most important one

660
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,850
that's why they made a card game impact

661
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,380
because of the elevation of privilege I

662
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,360
can get anything else there I've got

663
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,100
lateral movement an attack kill chain

664
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,510
with elevation of privilege so what

665
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,790
should be our primary objective in a

666
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,520
threat model so identify elevation of

667
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,170
privilege issues be sure first objective

668
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,180
so if you if you don't have enough time

669
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,920
you do your elevation of privilege

670
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,240
issues first and you can walk away and

671
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,770
you can see I've got I've got my 8020

672
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,200
role built-in so let's roll with it

673
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,280
now during sprint zero you want to find

674
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,820
your elevation of privilege issues

675
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,660
quickly and that way you can find you

676
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:33,820
can put in numbers instead of dash lines

677
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:35,050
for your trust boundaries all right so

678
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,250
an example they're gonna give you a bit

679
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,230
of guidance here this and this is based

680
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,090
upon doing this a number of times a lot

681
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,350
of times actually so originally I don't

682
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,030
give any upper bounds on putting numbers

683
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,340
on these things if you want to put 50 as

684
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,010
importance go ahead be my guest but

685
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,750
generally a range of 0 to 9 works that's

686
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,430
the kind of first kind of recommendation

687
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,440
I have now the other thing too is that

688
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,920
you want to be specific to the diagram

689
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,570
itself

690
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,950
so anything that communicates that

691
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,540
diagram is considered to be outside of

692
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,370
the bounds of that diagram outside of

693
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,649
the control of that diagram there gives

694
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,629
you a defense-in-depth that's why I say

695
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,370
right here I say internal communication

696
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,220
extra our communication I don't care if

697
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,469
it comes from outside to inside then

698
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,700
it's considered to be external and then

699
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,660
finally that last point right there is

700
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,550
you've built in your defense and

701
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,250
definitely looking at these things by by

702
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:20,169
putting in numerical references instead

703
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,000
of dash lines

704
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,550
so for example there's only one roller

705
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,590
here if it's zero it's out of your

706
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,899
control see it doesn't need those two

707
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,510
points right there at zero they're out

708
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,790
of your control

709
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:38,570
the next point right here is it's the

710
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:40,639
rule of thumb if data hits the disk it's

711
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,139
gonna be a highest and the highest point

712
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,610
on your diagram now I know that there

713
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,080
are exceptions to this for example if

714
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,419
you've got log files and log files are

715
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,250
kind of non-essential okay maybe it's

716
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,230
not highest value but if you've got

717
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,960
something like this like blob storage or

718
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,160
results data or analysis rules they're

719
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,240
gonna be pretty high value targets

720
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,270
aren't they ask what the bad guy wants

721
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,610
to go right especially in the analysis

722
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,800
right there the results data that's why

723
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,300
Gator results data 9 I said the blob

724
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,340
storage may be an 8 because inbound

725
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,649
inbound information might be slightly

726
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,990
less informational and then the analysis

727
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,640
rules as an attacker might be important

728
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,690
for me but maybe not as important as the

729
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,770
other things right there I could screw

730
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,960
up people and it's like that but I

731
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,080
couldn't really get the results out of

732
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,150
this whatever it is now we've got our

733
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,139
low points in our high points now

734
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,560
another rule of thumb right here

735
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,440
guidance as it were is that anything

736
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,850
that is intended to interface with the

737
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,050
external world or outside of your

738
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,939
diagram you designate is one low low

739
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,980
trust low value or like that so my

740
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,500
website and my API gateway both in

741
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,570
telling it communicates outside in

742
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,250
interfaces there gonna be a one like I

743
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,899
say it's guidance though because I have

744
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,610
done a number of threat models where

745
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,240
people end up with an API endpoint which

746
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:55,010
is at 6 or 7 and the team does this and

747
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,300
you say oh Jesus guys you've got a

748
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,710
pretty important jump right here you've

749
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,330
got like an outside influence going into

750
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,340
a pretty important API endpoint you

751
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,990
better secure that what you're doing is

752
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,370
you're allowing the team when you do

753
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,210
this because you're not gonna do it on

754
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,229
your own you're gonna do it with the

755
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,000
team you're allowing the team to

756
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,590
actually judge and to actually put these

757
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,230
numbers in with your guidance and your

758
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,970
help it's a very powerful thing indeed

759
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,800
the team comes to the conclusion with

760
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,190
your help you don't give them the

761
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,240
answers and sometimes it may come up but

762
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,680
you might come up with numbers so you

763
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,930
may say like I totally agree with that

764
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,590
and you can discuss with the team fine

765
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,870
fair enough

766
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,419
but if the team comes up with the

767
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,679
answers generally a size of 5 to 7

768
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,080
people and will come up with pretty

769
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,470
accurate estimates on what they think is

770
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,889
credit

771
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,419
or not and if we fill up the rest of

772
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,159
this stuff so in this example right here

773
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,100
the upper component I gave it a two

774
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,620
incremental e higher and then I say the

775
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,908
queueing with u5 maybe about

776
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,889
middle-of-the-road it's pretty important

777
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:49,909
but it's not one of the highest you know

778
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,309
you have imports because it's just

779
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:53,720
sending messages the parsing data

780
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,740
process analysis components maybe the

781
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,360
allowance can learn it might be a bit

782
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,919
higher because it has actually learning

783
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,658
rules and maybe the other two are a bit

784
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,330
lower because well they're just doing

785
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,590
other stuff I haven't defined and then

786
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,750
download it important I'd say is pretty

787
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,309
pretty important so I ranked that as a

788
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,230
six now imagine if I'm doing as part of

789
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,730
a team the team might come to the same

790
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,020
conclusion they might make the

791
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,929
downloader component higher or lower

792
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,549
that's up to them they know the software

793
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,380
I know security I'm not going to tell

794
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:21,408
them what their software is doing that's

795
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,260
a big thing right here I get a group

796
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:25,730
activity yay okay

797
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,230
so we've gone on to the next section of

798
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,520
DevOps right here which is create now

799
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,159
what you've done right here is you set

800
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,110
up a number of a series of numbers on

801
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,370
the diagram right here you maybe put

802
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,510
them into diagram you put them into a

803
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,080
spreadsheet which is Sochi with a

804
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,700
diagram

805
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,350
you've now linked the diagram with this

806
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,390
with some threat data right here already

807
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,039
the diagram changes and you don't add

808
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,299
new data to it then you know

809
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,530
automatically you're out of whack don't

810
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,129
you you don't go and look at another

811
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:51,408
diagram so we want to get to the good

812
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,549
stuff we don't want to get to threats

813
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,570
and start arguing about threats I told

814
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,860
you this beforehand we're gonna

815
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,590
shorthand the threats and we're gonna

816
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,820
longhand the mitigations so and this is

817
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,510
where I kind of like come to a bunch of

818
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,428
rules and I do okay

819
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,720
each funny enough I've got six rules and

820
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,640
there's six elements of strike

821
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,500
the first one is elevation of privilege

822
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,450
so if you run out of time if you do

823
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,620
elevation of privilege issues first you

824
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,789
know that if you finish up that threat

825
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,649
model you don't do anything more that

826
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:16,760
you've covered with 67% of the territory

827
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,360
five minutes

828
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,799
Wow okay I'm gonna speak fast okay so

829
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,399
first we do is elevation of privilege

830
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:27,080
issues and the rule here is it goes on a

831
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,970
target element and it's from low value

832
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,770
to high value so as you can see right

833
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,570
here going from the user to a website

834
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,950
the third party to the API gateway you

835
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,500
have a ton of elevation of privilege

836
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,870
issues which we expect to see don't we

837
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,440
the next part right here spoofing

838
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,850
threats

839
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,409
spoofing threats are gonna happen of

840
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,760
boundary elements on the again on the

841
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:45,029
target element they're gonna happen

842
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,469
where it's less than one

843
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:48,089
because you can have less than zero and

844
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:49,379
sup like that and where it's one or

845
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,509
greater so you have it on the website

846
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:53,248
and the API gateway again this is where

847
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:56,429
we expect to see we're looking for high

848
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:57,899
probability areas right here tampering

849
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,339
threats there's all over the place if

850
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,779
you haven't defined anything yet have we

851
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,178
waitin to find TLS or anything like that

852
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:05,339
this is just an empty diagram for us so

853
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,779
temporary threats exist everywhere okay

854
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:12,708
and they exist low value to high value

855
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:16,469
on the on the flows okay

856
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:17,609
four minutes repudiation threats so this

857
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:19,679
is an interesting one so repudiation

858
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:22,438
threats exist where you have an issue

859
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,299
with either tampering or eat or spoofing

860
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:25,469
so gonna see repudiation threats kind of

861
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,029
clustering around this area right here

862
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:28,739
now people may say to me they may argue

863
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:30,089
like well I never finishes threats

864
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:31,499
throughout the thing yes but these are

865
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,239
highest probability areas right here

866
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:36,589
you're gonna repute it and you're gonna

867
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,589
find them right at the beginning okay

868
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,359
next we have information disclosure

869
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:44,039
threats now this is an interesting one

870
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,989
it goes from high value to low value on

871
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,139
the flows and the definition again the

872
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:50,159
reasoning is is that you've got more

873
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:51,539
sensitive information potentially being

874
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,739
passed through a less sensitive zone

875
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,719
you've already defined those zones right

876
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:56,819
there so the interesting thing I've

877
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:58,229
found is with tampering and an

878
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:59,668
information disclosure threats you

879
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,769
protect one you generally protect both

880
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:05,249
of them okay like TLS for example will

881
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:08,039
protect both of those denial service

882
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:09,569
threats in exist on the flow or target

883
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,799
element where it goes less than one to

884
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:12,389
greater so it's very similar to where

885
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,799
the spoofing is and then again the

886
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:15,539
reason is if I'm an attacker and I get

887
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,619
deep inside of this system you're not

888
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,639
gonna be worried about the denial

889
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,619
service when we worry about a lot of

890
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:20,908
other things so denial service has a

891
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,468
highest probability of happening where

892
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:23,939
the attacker can influence it more

893
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:25,679
directly which is on the external

894
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:30,989
components or the components interface

895
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,609
or the or the the flows interface now

896
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:34,609
we've got all that right there boom okay

897
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:37,619
we got a whole set of threats don't mean

898
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:38,849
now we find out we can use zone math

899
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:40,109
because we've got the different numbers

900
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:42,239
where we going to where we're going to

901
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,069
concentrate our efforts sorry if I'm

902
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:45,899
running through on this fast folks I

903
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:48,149
think we're kind of trying to catch up

904
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:50,968
are we so if I could speak faster I

905
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:53,189
would okay so in that state case right

906
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:56,069
here you look for jumps take a look

907
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,620
right here so your third party goes to

908
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:00,629
your API gateway then jumps to your down

909
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,340
component we take jumps to your results

910
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,390
database you see the differences right

911
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,040
there 0 to 1 to 6 to 9 that's gonna be

912
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,750
pretty dangerous isn't in so I'm gonna

913
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,940
spend a lot of my effort and time

914
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,980
getting that right locking it down which

915
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,300
again is logical right and so we don't

916
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,680
we don't want people to access that

917
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,270
results data because that results data

918
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,550
might be anything it's personal

919
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,629
information it's sensitive information

920
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,370
so it marks out but if you get a very

921
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,720
complicated model much more complicated

922
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,090
in this it'll find these things really

923
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,980
fast and here's the beautiful thing

924
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,149
about it is with this information right

925
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,340
here you can go back to people who are

926
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,580
non-technical and you can say I've done

927
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,590
the work it's not just intuition it's

928
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,909
not just like you know security yes and

929
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,340
the intuition I've done the work and

930
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,309
here you go it shows you evidence why

931
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,990
you should be doing this so we read

932
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:47,428
through the mitigations now here's an

933
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,630
interesting thing so when people do

934
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:51,120
mitigations do you guys have your own

935
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,860
mitigation patterns or anything like

936
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,479
that or you work off of wasps patterns

937
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,719
what do you guys do so a show of hands

938
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,809
for Olas patterns a few people your own

939
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,530
mitigation patterns a few more people no

940
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:06,570
mitigation patterns everybody else so

941
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,740
okay now what you wanted to do is you

942
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,149
want a minute you want to minimize the

943
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,440
amount of effort you spent on doing the

944
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,150
mitigations and everything like that so

945
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,500
by that doing right there I recommend

946
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,690
that you do the mapping that told you

947
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,580
beforehand with the open Sam and from

948
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,929
open Sam then you map down and I what I

949
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,540
do with like a lot of my teams like to I

950
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:23,340
show them OS top 10s ok you've got the

951
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,540
OS top ten right now and use that as

952
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,129
kind of a framework I know it's not a

953
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,899
great one but look everyone understands

954
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,700
it and then from that they can roll up

955
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,100
to open Sam then the business guys can

956
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,830
understand and if you use that you let

957
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,330
you crowdsource all the mitigation

958
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,919
patterns initially you don't create your

959
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:41,370
own and if somebody else doesn't have to

960
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,660
maintain them etc etc all right so the

961
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,280
mitigation is like I said they can come

962
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,679
come from patterns and requirements you

963
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,360
have and this is where it ties back to

964
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,920
agile architecture because your guys

965
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,899
were doing the architecture this is the

966
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,160
security architects and they also the

967
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,570
functional architects should be giving

968
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,370
you patterns from the top you should be

969
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,960
feeding them back up there again I

970
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,129
apologize that I'm blazing through this

971
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,330
thing right here but I'm almost done

972
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:05,330
yeah I'm on time I know I'm over time

973
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,950
right okay time to wrap up so tampering

974
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,990
flow mitigation here's an example then

975
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,460
you can further on when you package it

976
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,710
up you can send your you can stop pull

977
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,600
request by using this information you

978
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,940
can send it out as JSON XML blah blah

979
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,678
blah okay you can do it and I've done

980
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,330
all this beforehand folks apologize

981
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,440
again but you can attach it ate it to

982
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,699
the bills you can send the bills out

983
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,510
there so you can actually put into it

984
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,700
