1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,379
thanks for having me here it's beautiful

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:10,530
city I think my battery is a little bit

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,219
dead so that's why I'm around here

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,490
how many of you have heard of Alaska ten

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:21,600
all of you right great

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,869
how many of you have heard of automated

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,400
threats handbook awesome that's like a

8
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,660
couple more than I thought

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,668
great so oh wasps is known for Hawass

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,320
top ten most top ten tracks like you

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,050
know web application vulnerability

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,820
issues that are so shaded with you know

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,430
weaknesses in the software lifecycle

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,980
injection or you know injection type of

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,899
attacks and so on right and that gets

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,190
refreshed like every three or four years

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:54,660
yeah but oughta make it threat we track

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,329
these BOTS and automated scripts that

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,519
are taken advantage of legitimate

20
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,520
features in the software so for example

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,129
things like login page right all you

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,010
know checkout page or how you check the

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:12,810
balance in your credit card and so on -

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,259
so this project started like back in

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,840
2015 and Colin Watson is one of my

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,270
collaborators and co-leads on this

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,299
project and since then you know this has

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,560
become basically a defective industry

29
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,090
standard in buying and selling and

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
finding solution for these automated

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,689
attacks so this talk is about that you

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,369
know how we can how we categorize this

33
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,500
categorize it you know create an apology

34
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,540
for these attacks and how you can use it

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,860
and also it would be like a call for

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,689
collaboration and so on

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,930
so a little bit of my background and

38
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,929
what I do I work at Verizon and as part

39
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,549
of Verizon that does like content

40
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,530
delivery network so we have like a lot

41
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,780
of these web servers that are throughout

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,689
the world and from that vantage point I

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,740
get to see you know all this both good

44
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,439
and bad

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,119
web traffic good like you know how it

46
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,579
could be like good BOTS like Google BOTS

47
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,679
and such engines and so on that are

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,620
happening but also a lot of bed and

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,690
nefarious activities like

50
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,370
attacks and also the exploits that I'm

51
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,319
going to talk about based on these are

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:25,330
automated scripts sure this is not

53
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,329
working sorry Oh does it

54
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,849
Oh

55
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:44,810
that doesn't have it ah ok so this is

56
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,700
the agenda you know we all start with

57
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,829
like why we started this project in

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,260
addition to you know us contained and

59
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,909
all all the projects that OS has and

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,920
what this project is about and we're

61
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,290
kind of deep dive into that quant ology

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,179
than we have created and then use cases

63
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,920
and what are the threats and what the

64
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,599
countermeasures are and a little bit of

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,208
roadmap on you know what snakes with

66
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:10,399
this project in this handbook so the

67
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:14,120
problem is this right here we are in

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,579
2019 we have secure software frameworks

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,590
and we also have like secure software

70
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:20,900
development lifecycle practices and so

71
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,849
on so from the InfoSec point of view

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,230
from the m/sec point of view right

73
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:29,179
things I like doing great you know we

74
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,280
take care of this sequel injection and

75
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,049
cross-site scripting and vulnerable

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,030
components and all that if you do the

77
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,560
SQL see right but that may not be true

78
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,319
for everyone but you know if one of us

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,150
start a project today then that's how

80
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,768
you're gonna do it and you you'll have a

81
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,319
pretty good chance that you know your

82
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,900
software is gonna be fairly robust and

83
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,608
reliable but what about from the ops

84
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,989
point of view right from the off point

85
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,480
of view that's what hops guys are seen

86
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,579
like oh we see a lot of attacks and we

87
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,730
see a lot of you know and wanted traffic

88
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:00,169
coming to us you know and you guys are

89
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,578
doing everything right that you said

90
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:03,199
about software development but how can

91
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,150
we're seeing attacks well one of the

92
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,099
reasons is there you know know whether

93
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,840
you are secure or not you'll receive

94
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:12,078
attacks just by being on the Internet

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,070
and the other part of the reason was

96
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:19,389
that you have legitimate features that

97
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,039
are not meant to be for mass consumption

98
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,870
yes they were meant to be for the human

99
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:27,560
users to interact with your software or

100
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,139
the application but the attackers with

101
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,110
their sometimes commercial motivations

102
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,669
they write automated scripts to take

103
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,250
advantage of these feature and Mars

104
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:39,469
right so that's what's going on and then

105
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,110
a vendor comes in I a you know I have

106
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,210
this does it all solution for all the

107
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,039
problems that you have I mean yeah that

108
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,450
product exists right everybody sells

109
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,630
that product but that product doesn't

110
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:53,010
exist

111
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,570
so that's the kind of that's a problem

112
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,030
that we try to address with this project

113
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,300
do you have a common vocabulary and

114
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,309
describing what these threats are and

115
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,230
you know so whether we're a defender or

116
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,020
whether you're a builder or whether

117
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,210
you're a vendor you can describe these

118
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,520
in a comment or comment on so this is

119
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,580
the goal of the language about the

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,590
project and the project is called OAuth

121
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,320
automated threats to web applications it

122
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,719
is by all standard what we called a lab

123
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,030
level so it's not experimental has been

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,240
quite mature for now there's no like a

125
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,130
flagship yet like almost on 10 so we

126
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,430
work into what the goal but the last

127
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,710
project review that was done as I we

128
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:39,450
graduated to the lab to the lab status

129
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,090
like I mentioned earlier Collin wasn't

130
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:45,030
started this project back in 2015

131
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,380
I met him presenting a version of this

132
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,260
an earlier version of this at a

133
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,659
conference and we started to collaborate

134
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,310
so from his point of view he was having

135
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,750
this ontology or the categorization and

136
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,270
connecting to other frameworks and so on

137
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,530
but he didn't have a lot of the industry

138
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,150
examples and industry practices and

139
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,299
that's why I came in like you know I saw

140
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,130
a lot of these problems and I had at the

141
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,330
time by partial solutions for this and

142
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,860
so on but so we kind of like complement

143
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,289
each other and we started collaborating

144
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,640
on this along with the project reviewers

145
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,000
that we don't like about a couple years

146
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,979
ago and some of the vendors a couple of

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,320
names that you see here they also

148
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:34,620
contributed ideas and data to this so

149
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,480
this is the data from one of the vendors

150
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,550
in this industry and this is the latest

151
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,870
one this is based on 2018 data so we

152
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,960
kind of divide that you know web traffic

153
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,970
into human traffic that's generated by

154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,099
the humans at the end of the other other

155
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,780
end of the connection but also the bots

156
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,420
I these are the automated threats but

157
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,159
not all bots are bad right so the bots a

158
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,650
lot you know such engine crawlers and so

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,380
on you don't want to interfere with them

160
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,380
you want them to be able to discover

161
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,300
your website and

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,880
part of their search engine index and

163
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,230
things like you know API access and Hajj

164
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,140
tech be a part of the infrastructure

165
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,120
they a part of that you know epi driven

166
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,840
type of software architecture so these

167
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,240
are all good bot traffic but if you look

168
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,849
at this data about 20% of the traffic on

169
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,790
that box so what are the bad BOTS so

170
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,890
instead of defining you know what bots

171
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:33,160
are we will define like what the threats

172
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:36,039
that are presented by the bolts so hence

173
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,320
the ontology right and we call it OS

174
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,430
automated threat or some people call it

175
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,670
Oates

176
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,950
it's an ontology or unwanted web

177
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,800
automation so bad BOTS right so good

178
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,780
bots are you know good web automation

179
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,380
and these are not born abilities and

180
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,359
that's important distinguished factor

181
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,390
between you know this and the Olas top

182
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,690
ten like project is that this one

183
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:05,020
focuses on how your legitimate features

184
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:08,770
are being abused by buy them by the bots

185
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:11,680
and we started with like a 20 and then

186
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,539
now we have about 21 threats that we

187
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,850
have discovered and categorized that

188
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,440
could grow as you know we discover more

189
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,870
patterns and so on you can think of this

190
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,900
like the patterns of these unwanted

191
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,300
automation this is not a top list

192
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,489
so sometimes people call like always top

193
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,100
20 or so this is not hot by any means

194
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,849
because we don't get a girl started by

195
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:40,719
you know threat or risk or and things

196
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:43,090
like that so here that 21 a couple of

197
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,910
changes that we made the list since the

198
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,610
last version of the book so the product

199
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,670
of this project is a book and currently

200
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,160
we are at version 1.2 of the book and

201
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:57,550
it's Thanksgiving 1.1 at 1.2 we added

202
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,310
this new category of threat or the in

203
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,880
denial our inventory and that's the

204
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,829
exhaustion of inventory that are in the

205
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,689
the merchants are in a warehouse or

206
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,060
however you call it in the digital

207
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:14,589
equivalent and we renamed capture

208
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,310
bypassed you capture defeat bypass met

209
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,260
the

210
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,719
no there's some issue with the capture

211
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,540
implementation but here capture defeat

212
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,320
means that you know these automated

213
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,089
scripts come up with like some Rai or

214
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,110
optical recognition and so on so these

215
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,339
features to defeat capture and the rest

216
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,560
of the stuff like you know scarfing

217
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,839
scraping steering sniping spamming and

218
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,880
so on so we will go into some of these

219
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,589
examples but you know the book will have

220
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,150
all these hop outline and catalog

221
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:49,089
so what other use cases what are the use

222
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,279
cases of this project and the book it's

223
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,350
if you are security architect right so

224
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,150
this should lead you to defining you

225
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,680
know software security requirements and

226
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,750
architecting it according to these

227
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,849
requirements and building it and so on

228
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,260
so not just about you know hey don't

229
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,180
have sequel injection use these

230
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,580
libraries this is also for like think

231
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,829
about this automated login abuse problem

232
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,870
and have countermeasures it built into

233
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:16,180
your software and also from the security

234
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,370
management perspective you know they can

235
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,020
share this information with peers in

236
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,940
their sector and also they can make

237
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,780
intelligent decisions about hey these

238
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,490
attacks are relevant for us and we see

239
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,930
that a lot in the industry and hence you

240
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,450
know we should spend more time and money

241
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,099
in addressing them versus you know these

242
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,130
are some threats that you know we don't

243
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,330
really see in our industry and so on and

244
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,010
of course you know from the security

245
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,680
analyst critique operations point of

246
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,300
view these are helpful in both you know

247
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,609
reporting it to either two different

248
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,099
organizations in your industry or just

249
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,420
within your company and you now have the

250
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,740
consistent vocabulary to describe these

251
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,689
and of course you know whether this also

252
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,820
helps their penetration testing or the

253
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,400
red team's not only that they need to

254
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,750
discover these vulnerabilities like in

255
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,520
traditional ones but also they need to

256
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,580
have an eye toward what kind of

257
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,360
legitimate features can be automated

258
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:15,070
automatically abused and especially you

259
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,020
know when you start a vendor

260
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,150
relationship and when you start you know

261
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,130
asking for bids and quotes and so all

262
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,290
this purchasing department can start

263
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,689
using that terminology till I hate we

264
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,069
need solutions to address these threats

265
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,500
and mr. vendor you know do you have

266
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,630
solution instead of like you know having

267
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,250
to bite this does it all solution and of

268
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,290
course you know this could also this

269
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,450
will also help vendors in a way that

270
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,730
they can describe their services and

271
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:46,220
products in ways that you know we all

272
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:50,450
understand so a soft 2019 today what's

273
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,670
new we published the latest of 1.2

274
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,860
version of the book about little more

275
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,589
than a year ago and like I mentioned

276
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,040
earlier we added new category of threat

277
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:03,980
called the denial of inventory and we

278
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,569
renamed one we did some cleaner in the

279
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,390
in the typos and type settings and some

280
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,460
clarification or some of the curve

281
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,949
countermeasures by how we describe it so

282
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,600
denial of inventory so that's a new one

283
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,670
that we added and we kind of debate it

284
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,710
over a little bit on you know do we need

285
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,020
a new category we don't want to create a

286
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,760
new category just for the sake of it so

287
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,400
we try to fit this problem into the

288
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,080
existing 20 categories and we attend out

289
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,300
that you know it doesn't really fit any

290
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,310
anyway so what is the Nala inventory

291
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,020
well think about an airline like a

292
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,510
discount key carrier or something like

293
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,540
that and they have the special promotion

294
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,610
phase like you know I was working with a

295
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,099
car company in Hong Kong so like go to

296
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,720
Phuket for like 20 Hong Kong dollars you

297
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,580
know round trip or whatever right that's

298
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,590
maybe they have five tickets of the

299
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,500
price and the other part other tickets

300
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,000
are like normal price right so what what

301
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,300
happens to them was like there are some

302
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,770
bolts that put all that inventory all

303
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,859
the seating inventory not just for the

304
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,510
five promotion of a but you know all

305
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,700
like hundred twenty or whatever two

306
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,230
hundred tickets on that fly they put it

307
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,940
in the basket and they keep doing their

308
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,820
and they turn around and sell it in the

309
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,410
you know a third party market at the

310
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,300
regular price or a little bit less than

311
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,730
a regular price and only when they have

312
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,530
that buyer on the other side they turn

313
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,260
around and buy from this you know

314
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,120
Airlines website right so from Airlines

315
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,580
point of view yeah the ticket got sold

316
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,370
but in any case all do the right person

317
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,500
but as a psych consequence all the

318
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,960
tickets that are available are held up

319
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,820
in the checkout basket for however long

320
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,320
you know the time out but if it turns

321
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,920
out that these are BOTS right are they

322
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,739
gonna put it in the basket again

323
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,899
so the entire inventory gets held up in

324
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:51,850
the app so we created this category to

325
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:59,499
describe that problem and these are the

326
00:13:51,850 --> 00:14:01,929
little diagrams over you know how boxes

327
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:04,089
and suffice that we use to describe this

328
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:06,730
problem so usually the yellow ones are

329
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:11,699
the assets that we are trying to protect

330
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,699
and the type of interactions and so on

331
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,910
so this is basically in a preview of the

332
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,899
book like how the book is structured so

333
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:25,689
we describe the ontology 21 now and we

334
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:27,309
added more examples that that's when I

335
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,799
started collaboration we're calling on

336
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:31,238
these and we edit also countermeasure

337
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,949
classes so I'll get into what

338
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:34,959
countermeasures are and how we classify

339
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:37,179
them into different type of powder

340
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,589
measures and of course you know use case

341
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:44,290
scenarios in the reference a little bit

342
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,079
of status about this you know this this

343
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,959
was last review SL as an always project

344
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:52,149
and my goal is to have it review again

345
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,299
later this year so let's walk through

346
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:56,919
some other examples right so this is

347
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,649
what we call the account takeover this

348
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,569
is what usually business folks will

349
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,309
describe it all you know how it gets

350
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:06,160
bubble up to the management like we have

351
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:08,790
account takeover problem right but if

352
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,189
this project kind of breaks it down into

353
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,469
the threads the lead do their contact

354
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:16,660
with a problem so in this case you know

355
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,939
these two threats that we describe here

356
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,309
like credential cracking and credential

357
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:23,439
stuffing they can lead into account

358
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:25,149
takeover problem so they they sound

359
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,368
similar but they're two different hypo

360
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,160
attacks and has two different type of

361
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:32,350
threats so how are they different so

362
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,839
this is credential stuffing right in

363
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,789
credential stuffing threat the attacker

364
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,989
would get acquired this you know

365
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,619
credentials from the other from the

366
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:44,459
black market or somebody breach you know

367
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:47,559
user data and because we tend to reuse

368
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:50,888
passwords and we use we tend to use our

369
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,839
email address as a username if you try

370
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,550
and even if you get like one percent or

371
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,560
even 0.5 percent success rate if you

372
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,959
right now if you get enough accounts do

373
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,180
you break into that account right and

374
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,349
and you don't have to do repeatedly do

375
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,899
that you can do that through the

376
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,360
distributive way you can kind of fly

377
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,339
under the radar by like just doing it

378
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,110
like you know two three requests a

379
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:14,329
minute or something like that to be or

380
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,670
you can even take advantage of the

381
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:20,209
botnet that you can rent to send these

382
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:22,790
requests that is different from

383
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,739
credential cracking and this is more

384
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,620
like the brute force cracking right so

385
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,180
you will use one economy and then you'll

386
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,839
you know to like you know pass what one

387
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,399
and pass back to pass a 3 and so on and

388
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,140
this will be a little easier to detect

389
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,860
because you'll see you know one username

390
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,589
associated with a lot of failures but

391
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,649
the other one credential stuffing will

392
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,640
be a little harder to detect because the

393
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,920
only happens once

394
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,620
right so for me my email account and

395
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,089
whatever the credential that I lost

396
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,529
other you know some website lost

397
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,529
it'll be try and if it doesn't work that

398
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:03,680
there'll be another person's emails so

399
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,119
that's a subtle difference that you know

400
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,159
you have to be mindful of when you're

401
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,369
building that accounting mission and so

402
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,319
on so the similar thing credit card

403
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:14,208
abuse right so the business problem like

404
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,889
you know hey you know my credit card

405
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,900
charge back rates are high you know how

406
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,490
do we address it but the technical

407
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,880
threats for that are like what we call

408
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,270
the carding cranking and cashing

409
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,949
out

410
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,439
you know cashing outs are probably

411
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,690
easier to understand but what about the

412
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,070
difference between cutting and cracking

413
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,929
so one is to do what has to deal with

414
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,059
just to check the validity of the credit

415
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:40,490
card like whether you know that card is

416
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,830
a valid combination of you know the

417
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,470
valid format valid ass checks on type of

418
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,540
credit card data and also like if it is

419
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,290
like a store credit card and so on you

420
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,000
know if it is still valid in that system

421
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,159
how cracking it's basically brute

422
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,050
forcing right so it's very similar to

423
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,750
like you know a Prudential stuffing and

424
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,480
credit shell cracking but you know it's

425
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,309
two different types of our threats and

426
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,620
they're cashing out cashing out is the

427
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,450
way the PD counts to the criminals right

428
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,099
so I what

429
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,820
a couple of companies ago I work with

430
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:16,458
this service let's call it like somebody

431
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,349
who sells their time on the internet

432
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:22,369
right so it could be like a psychic or

433
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:24,499
it could be like you know at some advice

434
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,238
relationship advice or you know tax

435
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:29,119
advice or you know you just need to talk

436
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:31,519
to someone that you call another and you

437
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,080
know they will match and what's what the

438
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,320
criminals we're doing was the DA

439
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,889
registering a lot of accounts on both

440
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,749
sides right one on the on the psychic

441
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:43,189
side and the other on the seekers

442
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:47,450
although you know people who are seeking

443
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:49,159
advice I and the people who are buying

444
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,859
that advice is paying with a stolen

445
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,749
credit card but they are getting

446
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,949
they also they're the same people so

447
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:57,889
they're getting paid through that system

448
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,079
and although the system takes about 30%

449
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:01,609
cut or whatever the high margin but it's

450
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,979
still you know stolen credit card you

451
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,418
get some money out of it so these are

452
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:07,190
the type of scenarios it could be the

453
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:12,229
physical goods to like sometimes people

454
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,879
get recruited to pay there's a job that

455
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:16,879
you know your job is all to like you

456
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:18,498
know repack this good because we're

457
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:20,208
people are sending it as the gift and

458
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:22,129
they don't want the recipient you know

459
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:24,139
that this comes from you know Amazon or

460
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:25,939
Walmart or what have you so like oh I

461
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:28,099
want all you have to do is like you know

462
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,289
take it out of this box but in a new box

463
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:32,359
wrapping with a wrapping paper and you

464
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:35,869
get money but then what they're doing is

465
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:38,029
to sending to send these goods that are

466
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:40,728
bought with a stolen credit card it cost

467
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:44,329
you this at that party and sometimes

468
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:45,799
that makes it do the news here the

469
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:48,408
problem that I have seen is like

470
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,359
e-commerce companies you know the big

471
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:52,879
dinner getting skewed because you know

472
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,489
they're a lot of scrapers that are

473
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,949
running and you know they always keep an

474
00:19:55,489 --> 00:20:00,379
eye toward like you know what's the

475
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,940
ratio of like a lookbook versus buy and

476
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:05,589
that Rachel will be off when you have a

477
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:09,669
lot of BOTS visiting your website right

478
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:13,309
so ad fraud is another one like similar

479
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:15,169
cashing out strategy that you have you

480
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,109
know you set up your website with a lot

481
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:19,969
of third-party advertisement for like

482
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:21,560
Google Adwords and so on and but you

483
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,330
have a lot of bars visiting your

484
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,190
you know your click rate will be high

485
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,350
and your compression will be highs and

486
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,630
you turn around and you know claim like

487
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:33,949
hey you know we serve like this many

488
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:36,800
impressions of head and so skewing is

489
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,440
what I described earlier and of course

490
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,070
you know having to deal with these

491
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,870
unwanted automated traffic has a stress

492
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,970
on your infrastructure so even now

493
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,949
whether you're using cloud

494
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,200
infrastructure with auto scaling or your

495
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,060
own pram you have to have like enough

496
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
capacity and that cost you money

497
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,730
right and the technical threats that

498
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,070
lead to this problem are denial of

499
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,170
service right and you can have a lot of

500
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,240
bars you know just make like a lot of a

501
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,610
nefarious database our query type of

502
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,060
stuff the best one to do that is to look

503
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:13,820
for a description in the product catalog

504
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,330
with that some random Jacquot so that

505
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,610
database will have to do the entire you

506
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,520
know and structure and index a search on

507
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,129
the description field of the product but

508
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,330
since that that these terms don't exist

509
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,280
you know it has to go through the entire

510
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,649
database and so on and of course war

511
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:37,190
nobody scanning that's pretty much in

512
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:38,990
the understood issue but and also they

513
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,150
can be buying stuff but they can be in

514
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,770
there they can be the wrong people who

515
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,590
are buying it scalping is kind of the

516
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,900
issue that I mentioned earlier about the

517
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:53,419
you know budget airline that leads to

518
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,950
the denial of inventory problem but the

519
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,250
other the other threat that they have

520
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,110
with this is this scoping you know

521
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,330
there's a there goods being so in the

522
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,439
black market and sniping is like you

523
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,720
know when you time you're right

524
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,310
especially like an auction site and you

525
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,500
time it like you know just like two

526
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,510
seconds before the auction ends or

527
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,220
something it's hard for a human user to

528
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,379
compete with it when you have you're

529
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:21,770
buying bought you know program to be

530
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:25,430
that way so ok so what are people doing

531
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,320
to defend against these so that's a

532
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,240
version 1.1 off the book you know we

533
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,830
surveyed these are countermeasure

534
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,650
methods we put them in two different

535
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,300
classes and different phases or software

536
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,330
development

537
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,560
cycle then you can apply them to so

538
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,659
these are the 14 different

539
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,120
countermeasures that are in no

540
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:46,750
particular order and the way that we

541
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,959
organize them is through in a couple of

542
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:52,780
ways so one is like how in what face of

543
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,270
the sdlc you can apply these techniques

544
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,520
and of countermeasures right so the

545
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,040
Fussell so we divide it into two

546
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,050
different types of people by builders

547
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,210
and defenders so builders are the people

548
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,010
that who are willing and able to make no

549
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,230
changes right sometimes even you

550
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,810
inherited code you bought systems and

551
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,980
software but you know it's you don't

552
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,480
know how that works you don't have the

553
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,430
ability to change it or you may have the

554
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,080
source code but you don't you don't have

555
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,240
people who can work with the code

556
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,649
anymore but if you do have people who

557
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,150
can work with the code and especially

558
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,950
you know in the beginning of the

559
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,520
software development project you can

560
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:30,160
apply some of these techniques in other

561
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,410
cases you know the the defender comes in

562
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,060
and they must walk around the system so

563
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,730
whether there be like providing another

564
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,220
layer of protection or having a module

565
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:42,760
that is inside the web server and so on

566
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,530
to basically work around the code so

567
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,270
that you can detect it it could be like

568
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,370
log analysis you know it could be part

569
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,030
of the proxies or content delivery

570
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,739
networks and so on to defend that

571
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:57,430
vulnerable system by walking around it

572
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,590
and then we define these countermeasures

573
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,390
are three different types one is to

574
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,490
prevent one is to detect and when it's

575
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,330
to recover I think it could be a pretty

576
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,400
self-explanatory

577
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,860
you know prevent great if you can

578
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,590
prevent it but a lot of times you know

579
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,330
in some cases it may not be possible to

580
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,060
prevent it so like I mean you can you

581
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:20,919
detect it and can you recover it can you

582
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:23,260
you know make this impact limited so

583
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,480
here it's one example you know we call a

584
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,550
rate basically kind of rate controls

585
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,680
against you know how many times a

586
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,810
function can be invoked so for example

587
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,450
like on the login page you know if

588
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,730
single IP can you know try to login

589
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,290
maybe no more than two times it's a

590
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,660
minute or something like that right you

591
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,790
can put these controls and it's not just

592
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,800
you know this is that was a very simple

593
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,780
example but it it may also be like you

594
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,010
know you can only do you know X amount

595
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,350
of dollars by transact

596
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,809
you know and you can combine there with

597
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,418
other countermeasure techniques like

598
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:57,990
device fingerprinting you know I key

599
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:00,669
revocation whether they come from like

600
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,890
you know cloud infrastructure versus

601
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,230
consumer home IPS and things like that

602
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,400
you can use these different types of

603
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,590
information and different type of

604
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,520
countermeasures together but the goal of

605
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:14,530
the rate is to limit you know what a

606
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,410
legitimate user does versus like what

607
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,940
automated threat will do and these bots

608
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:21,280
will adjust to that they will figure out

609
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,380
I'll you know you allow only one login

610
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,850
per minute so okay you know how they do

611
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,790
like you know one per minute but how to

612
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,699
use a botnet to do that so there'll be

613
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,740
other things that you need to go you

614
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,730
need to do but this this is a good

615
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:41,020
starting point so this type of

616
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,660
countermeasure can be done doing your in

617
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,460
your code right you can put the kind of

618
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,559
inherent controls in your code while

619
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,600
you're designing it or writing it or you

620
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,549
can do it at another layer like at a

621
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,610
proxy level or something by monitoring

622
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:56,460
or monitoring your logs and so on and I

623
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,168
call it like you know this is about

624
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,600
protecting and detecting you can use it

625
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,809
for both purposes this probably wouldn't

626
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,969
give you a lot of recovery this probably

627
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,520
is applicable to all kinds of threats

628
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,919
and by just by you know limiting how

629
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,610
much damage you've taken it can be done

630
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,490
to you you have you have some advantage

631
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:22,240
maybe some exceptions but it'll be you

632
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,460
know corner cases I know there is device

633
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,450
fingerprinting right so a lot of times

634
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,870
you know there is the bot evolve over

635
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,490
time

636
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,559
right the denver's of the bots are like

637
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,630
just you know a Perl script or a Python

638
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,309
script that they don't even bother to

639
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,049
change the user agent so it'll be like

640
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:40,600
Python library and so on in the user

641
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:43,299
agent these are easy to detect and these

642
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,040
are easy to block but bots become also

643
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,750
fistic ated over time and especially

644
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,659
with the automation framework like

645
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,640
selenium and phantoms yes and so on you

646
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,070
actually have a browser function in

647
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,530
browser and sometimes is at the consumer

648
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,330
IP that you know home IP that is being

649
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,420
compromised on some device behind that

650
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:04,149
IP so it's harder to tell you

651
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,880
whether it's a human or not but you know

652
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,200
the countermeasure techniques also

653
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,300
evolve and the right device

654
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,030
fingerprinting you know hey if you're a

655
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,070
real user using this browser you will

656
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,899
have these fonts install you'll have the

657
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,419
screen resolution of this site it's not

658
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,030
a headless browser and your mouse

659
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,550
movement maybe you know this this speed

660
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,960
and so on so it can be pretty elaborate

661
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,909
but there requires you know running

662
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,550
JavaScript in the context of the browser

663
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,650
to do make sure and this is effective

664
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,750
against eye scraping type of activities

665
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,240
like somebody trying to go through anti

666
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,680
catalog to scrape your prices that they

667
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,780
can beat you in the shopping comparison

668
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,820
site but this may not be too effective

669
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,590
against like a single request things

670
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:50,439
like a login or something again this can

671
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,790
be applied during either as a part of

672
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,520
the system or software that you're

673
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:57,879
building all around it but either way

674
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,470
you know this is preventing a detecting

675
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,980
recovery would it make a lot of sense

676
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:07,240
and this is applicable basically against

677
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:09,130
most of the threat but fingerprinting as

678
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,070
a countermeasure doesn't really help

679
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,940
against fingerprinting threat

680
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,550
fingerprinting threat is basically just

681
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,440
figuring out what kind of software

682
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,510
version you're running and usually you

683
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,880
know if you're had us think about the

684
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:25,030
information that that could be bad for

685
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,550
you capacity that could be like you know

686
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:32,350
having elastic infrastructure to scale

687
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:34,300
up and down if it can help and you can

688
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,219
also you know pause you it could be like

689
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,710
using a content delivery network or

690
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,840
something like there to kind of disperse

691
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,940
low but again you know that there has

692
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,560
cost or you could be like you know just

693
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,160
having a limited amount of supply of

694
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,260
goods and so on right but we don't just

695
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,540
like you know which method is more

696
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,270
effective than other we just discover

697
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,300
these methods and you know but there may

698
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:03,340
be categories in catalog them gain

699
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:05,260
capacity when they're applicable you can

700
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,510
do it as part of the software or part of

701
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,940
the system outside the software this

702
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,470
would prevent and if this also helped

703
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,070
you recover once you have more capacity

704
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,070
and

705
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,820
it's usually uh you know if you're

706
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:20,559
subject to like denial or service type

707
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,600
of attacks but this helps a lot of

708
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,129
vulnerability scanning just by you know

709
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,189
having more capacity that you don't have

710
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:32,230
to deal with this consequences of these

711
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:33,490
threats so when we approach this problem

712
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,290
we not only look at it from the

713
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,870
technical standpoint but we also look at

714
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,190
it from the business standpoint because

715
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,979
at the end of the day this is the

716
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,809
business problem the good thing about

717
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,970
this problem is if it's a quantifiable

718
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:47,500
problem in there a lot of times when I

719
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,059
talk to the customers who have this

720
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,580
problem they know how much it is cost

721
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,960
this problem is causing them and that's

722
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,490
because they have to pay for the

723
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,520
infrastructure for example airline

724
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:01,140
ticket issue Airlines will have the

725
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,700
front end web page but the back end of

726
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,580
keeping the seat inventory and selling

727
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,590
the inventory is handled by a few bank

728
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,928
and providers and they have to pay for

729
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,549
every lookup that's whenever a consumer

730
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:16,270
comes in and such as the flight through

731
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:22,000
their front web page they have to pay

732
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:24,129
for that right so okay site working a

733
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,960
little bit so that this is a business

734
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,780
problem so we also look at it from the

735
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,490
how other you know how we can prevent it

736
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,899
from the business standpoint so it could

737
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,360
be like a contract and terms and

738
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,270
conditions you know like for example if

739
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,668
it's a fraud case you know you get your

740
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,860
maximum payout for serving the ads from

741
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:44,980
the inventory is like X amount of

742
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,168
dollars so by putting these business

743
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,480
level controls you can address these

744
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:51,820
problems and sharing our information

745
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,320
that this project is part of that you

746
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,990
know how we can share this information

747
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,840
in the proper context and proper

748
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:00,429
vocabulary so you know cause it's a

749
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,110
great community share but it could also

750
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:06,100
be like your regional cert you know your

751
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:08,139
industry groups and so on yeah so now

752
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,120
that you know we have this project in

753
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,130
the handbook which is free is on the

754
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,689
whole wass website if you want a printed

755
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,780
copy you can also get a printed copy

756
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,040
it's cost like about $10 for the print

757
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,549
you know we don't we don't make any

758
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,590
money the book is free the printing

759
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,510
press will charge you some money so now

760
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,658
that you know info ii describe like you

761
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,940
know i have this

762
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:32,570
shoe that I need some solution and

763
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,399
offset like yeah you know the marketing

764
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,908
is also complaining that they have some

765
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,039
issues about you know this problem and

766
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:41,479
we need some solution to buy this and

767
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,489
then the vendor can come and sell this

768
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:44,679
all you can build it on your own like

769
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:47,419
you know all these methods are

770
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,769
catalogued in this book it's a matter of

771
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:50,479
like you know it makes more sense for

772
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:54,559
you to build it on your own or buy it

773
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:57,139
from someone so this is calling my

774
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,440
collaborator and it you know the founder

775
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:02,449
of this projects little about me next

776
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,729
things that we trying to do we have a

777
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,320
project showcase tomorrow so if you want

778
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:09,259
to have a mall you know interactive

779
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,629
discussion please come by and a we need

780
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:13,460
more collaborators you know it's right

781
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:19,340
now it's pretty much me about this

782
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:21,619
project so and my goals are to like you

783
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:26,539
know have a project of you in for maybe

784
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:28,309
at the apps like USA in September do we

785
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,349
need to add additional threads do we

786
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,340
need to discover additional

787
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:34,158
countermeasures if you have experience

788
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,199
with that and we do need you know more

789
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,659
cleaner more readability right now it

790
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,039
kind of reads like a phone book and

791
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:45,139
translations and I was talking to the

792
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,509
guy from China OWASA he said I know this

793
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:49,369
has already been translated to two

794
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,979
Chinese but that's great but you know if

795
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,809
we can do that for other languages or

796
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:55,970
also like you know if you're bilingual

797
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:57,678
multi-language if you want to be a

798
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,639
review of these books or I want these

799
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,840
translations to be a curate yeah I think

800
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:04,840
we have time for one or two questions

801
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
any questions

802
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:24,379
all right well yeah so thank you for

803
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:28,129
your talk

804
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:31,890
currently showing the capture one of the

805
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:36,030
most popular and main contra mayors

806
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:38,370
against automatic attacks and so on but

807
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:42,270
in the same time right now it's it's

808
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:46,290
really looks break it a breakable and so

809
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:49,650
on what do you think will be the next

810
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:52,440
generation basic level of maybe basic

811
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:56,880
want Romero good economy measure against

812
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,400
South America taxes yeah so one school

813
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,890
of thought on that is if you have this

814
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,890
soft catcher URI are doing a very poor

815
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,990
job of detecting bots so you're you know

816
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,899
the goal of the bot medication is to

817
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,520
figure out so that you don't need to

818
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:16,049
surf the capture and when you surf the

819
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,389
capture you the goal of that is do like

820
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,649
caps a lobby saw I basically the bots

821
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,899
will just go away that this is too

822
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:24,210
difficult so it depends on like how

823
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:27,060
accurately you can detect these attacks

824
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,369
without relying on the capsule solving

825
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,710
capability right and on the other side

826
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:34,649
there are some you know better capture

827
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,960
solutions right that's you know that's

828
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:38,759
the companies around it like use more

829
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,649
mathematical model as a lighting and

830
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,409
shading and so on to make the capture

831
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:47,489
solving more difficult but you know it's

832
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,669
anytime that you have your self capture

833
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:53,549
it impedes with the user experience and

834
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:55,049
you know both the consumers businesses

835
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,670
like banks and so on they don't like

836
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:02,390
capture but you know and maybe the

837
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,390
defense of last resort

838
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,379
any other well thank you so much for

839
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:13,660
coming and yeah please come back

840
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,660
tomorrow to have a more discussion
