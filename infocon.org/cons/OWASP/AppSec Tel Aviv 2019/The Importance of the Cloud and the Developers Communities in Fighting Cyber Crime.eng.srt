1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,480
so good morning everybody it's great to

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,960
see you here both the people from Israel

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,059
didn't the native Israelis and all the

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,910
guests and two things that I wanted to

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,119
say I'm the CTO I love what I'm doing

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,189
and Alpher talked before about

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,130
innovation and other people that's what

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,900
I do for a living and it's fun and to

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,689
innovation it's not just having great

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,339
ideas but making sure that all those

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,110
great ideas turn into into product that

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,730
the real people are using that's for me

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,800
is innovation and of course business

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:46,379
success so without any further ado okay

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,819
it's your let lets let's start okay so

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,059
first of all I'm going to start with

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,030
cyber cyber crime and it's not yours

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,519
that almost every week we every day we

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,430
hire about we hear about a new cyber

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,109
attack and this is just few attacks that

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,300
happen in the last two years and

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,580
obviously I don't expect you to remember

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,330
all of them but let's focus on some of

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,189
the most recent one this was this was a

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,390
representative actually attack on

26
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,679
happens to be on British Airways but

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,920
someone installed there a very tiny

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,950
piece of code which was added in the

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,900
bridge of three hundred and eighty

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,900
thousand records of British Airways

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,670
customers now it's not a big number

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:35,759
relative to millions but it's each its

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,979
each records like this is worth a lot of

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,960
money in the underworld

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,720
why because obviously the people that

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,689
are used British Airways especially the

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,270
top ones have a lot of money in their

38
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,898
accounts now this is another interesting

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:58,259
thing because we see that in the past it

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:02:00,899
was very easy to just steal credit cards

41
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,649
and use them and this was called

42
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,639
card-present attacks however in recent

43
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,959
year with all they have with all the

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,119
advances the credit card that you have a

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,040
cheap etc it's become much more

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,950
difficult to do a

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,959
present attack therefore most of the

48
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,600
attacks are now are card-not-present

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,020
which means that the people are still I

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,760
mean tips are stealing your credentials

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,770
that they can use in carton president

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,500
internet etc there are many attacks like

53
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,290
this and by the way the price of the

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,830
card-not-present potentials rise to the

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,579
ceiling

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,430
what obviously as you know there is a

57
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,770
the under the the underground underworld

58
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,440
it's it's a mirror image of the

59
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,269
immediate of the legitimate industry

60
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,680
they have the developers they have the

61
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,500
people that are dealing with the

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,410
marketing franchise etc and obviously

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:01,430
there is a lot of a very rich commercial

64
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:10,739
scene where people are dealing with that

65
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:12,810
ok another ok so another attack

66
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,700
everything is being attacked and again

67
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,709
the the criminals are very not only

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,480
they're very technological savvy they're

69
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,519
very economical and business savvy

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,290
they're very short businessman so

71
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,170
obviously like bodybuilding which

72
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,650
happens few months ago in January sorry

73
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,350
in February still a lot of Records

74
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,269
another interesting attack is actually

75
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,790
happened only two weeks over Baltimore

76
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,640
with the ransomware the whole city was

77
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,769
completely shut down and just an attack

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,380
that happened three days ago and this is

79
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,140
one of the most big the biggest attack

80
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,980
but it will create its record only four

81
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,429
weeks because someone will top that as

82
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,119
the first American finance disclosed

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:05,040
that millions hundreds of millions of

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,739
records of their customers where stolen

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,160
so and and this continue and continue

86
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:16,430
why because it's it's very lucrative and

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:19,409
it's very it's very it's it's very

88
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,060
beneficial for the people who do it and

89
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,120
don't get caught and many of them don't

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,039
code code ok

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,450
so until now what we saw we saw attacks

92
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,419
on data this

93
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,229
is a data or money this is this is what

94
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,930
most of that tax happen so far in

95
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,520
international to reuse we started to

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:44,580
also see attack things except expecially

97
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,520
with the proliferation of Internet of

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,919
Things okay so what do fish and tanks

99
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,020
and baby monitors and inflation raters

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,910
have in common the fact that there are

101
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,950
small computers and they are connected

102
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:00,240
to the Internet and this is obviously

103
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:03,150
IOT okay so there will your famous

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,710
attacks recently I'm going to talk one

105
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,859
of my favorite attack you know when you

106
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,620
attack IOT you can attack the devices

107
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,780
you can attack the center of control

108
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,970
it's already really it's really one what

109
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,880
do you what is your goal as a criminal

110
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,300
and sometimes you want to just leverage

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,190
the IOT as a vector of entry to the

112
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,100
corporate and that's what's the attack

113
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,110
with the famous attack with the fish

114
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,890
tank in one of the biggest casino in in

115
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,230
Los Angeles

116
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:39,900
what happened had a really amazing

117
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:43,140
amazing fish tank there and and a fish

118
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:48,060
tank has a small application that could

119
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,860
display that could dispose the the food

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,080
for the fish remotely because nobody

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,440
want really to go to the fish tank but

122
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,930
this remote control this remote access

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,969
was connected also to the corporate

124
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,040
network obviously nobody thought that

125
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,690
the fish has anything to hide or any

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:11,220
interesting data so nobody thought to

127
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:13,170
put any means of of security there which

128
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:18,930
was of course an arrow so someone's

129
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:21,630
leverage the that device for fish

130
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,660
supposing food and from that they were

131
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,310
able to go to the corporate network

132
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,650
because it was connected to the

133
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,020
corporate network lateral movement and

134
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:36,120
got to the database of all the all the

135
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:40,169
customers of the casino and they stole

136
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,800
it okay and and obviously most of you

137
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,509
remember them

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
I attack that was the biggest DDoS

139
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,889
attack that leveraged IOT that all that

140
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,460
happens about a little bit over a year

141
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,440
ago

142
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:54,090
another interesting attack that I want

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:57,120
to talk about it and that shows

144
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,818
innovation ok innovation not of the good

145
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,120
computing community which sits here but

146
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:06,840
on the very active underground community

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,319
so this this is called metal T and metal

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,650
T actually made is manipulation

149
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,990
manipulation of demand of IOT and it's

150
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,299
actually attacking the power grid now

151
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,150
most of the attacks on power grid like

152
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,180
all you remember there was a power

153
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:27,000
failure in Brazil or in the US for many

154
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,610
for many days usually what they attack

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,400
they attacked the grid itself ok what is

156
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,050
innovative talking about innovation

157
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,750
what is innovating in this attack is

158
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,030
that it's the first time that they

159
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,800
attack it through the devices what did

160
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,059
they do they're the criminals they

161
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,750
install the malware that controls the

162
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:55,560
voltage of the voltage of the devices

163
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,690
and what happens if apparently if at one

164
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,830
point you increase the device they

165
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:04,380
devote the power demand from many many

166
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,529
devices or the curiousity at the same

167
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:11,009
time the power grid cannot handle it

168
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,110
so get again and and that's again showed

169
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,360
the innovation and it will continue that

170
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,830
are very very innovative very tech savvy

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:24,719
that's why we you have to be one step I

172
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:29,669
have them okay so we talked about just a

173
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:34,020
bit in numbers so the and this keeps

174
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:37,169
coming up in the cost of breach when I

175
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,478
started following that which was more

176
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:43,319
than ten years ago was less than 1

177
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,079
million now in the u.s. it's 17 million

178
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,040
the cost of the average bridge if we

179
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,900
talk about how long it takes before an

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,310
apt attack advanced persistent that

181
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,590
that that goes into your corporate

182
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,050
network before we get found

183
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,230
now it's 90 days by the way here we

184
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:11,079
improve it used to be 250 days we I mean

185
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:14,860
the security community the the the the

186
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,050
total damage from cybercrime is going up

187
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,300
and now it's it's not now it's going to

188
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,359
be it's predicted that it's going to be

189
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,089
in 2020 to 8 trillion dollars is just

190
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,780
for me at least it's impossible to not

191
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:31,750
to imagine such a huge number

192
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:35,560
another interesting another interesting

193
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:40,120
and less known fact is that the the long

194
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,540
term not just the short term effect of

195
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,990
cyber crime on the economy but also the

196
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,680
long term effect because eternal inner

197
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:54,450
in a recent research that 20% of

198
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,640
customers that their company experienced

199
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,530
an attack will not return to this

200
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:05,199
company which means it was a long-term

201
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:07,510
effect in reputation ok

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,450
trends in cyber crime so it's

203
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,180
interesting to know that and it's

204
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,170
probably not a surprise that for the

205
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,339
past 7 years

206
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,530
there is the director of national of

207
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,080
national security in the US and every

208
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,530
year they publish a report and they say

209
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:32,220
what is the biggest threat to the US for

210
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:36,040
the first 70 years since 1945 it was

211
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:41,470
nuclear power not surprising the first

212
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:44,020
time for in 2018 for number 1 is cyber

213
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,270
ok and cyber it's not just the

214
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,090
technological but also all the effects

215
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,449
to the economy to the society etc and

216
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:56,650
nuke went only to number 2 terrorism to

217
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,210
number 3 and under is interesting and

218
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,400
it's especially for you as the

219
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,140
developers community and and the

220
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,060
communities in general is what are the

221
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,499
next frontier ok so we talked about

222
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,659
which data we talked about bridging

223
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:14,119
things but the next thing is really

224
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:16,609
bridging first reality and when I'm

225
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:19,219
talking about reaching reality it's not

226
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,319
fake news this is just a simple thing of

227
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,399
telling a lie about something that

228
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:26,209
didn't happen okay

229
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,089
faked reality is much more scary it's

230
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,878
creating really an alternate alternative

231
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,579
reality okay and and think about it like

232
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:39,739
right now we have so many cameras and

233
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:42,498
and if a killer or tip is caught in one

234
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:44,059
of the security cameras it's obviously

235
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,479
admitted at the missable in a court of

236
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,769
law

237
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:52,339
but now it's becoming easy to inject

238
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:54,289
pictures footage into those cameras so

239
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,779
it's really becoming a reality because

240
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:59,779
if someone saw you're stealing or

241
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:03,049
killing this is the reality but it's not

242
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,899
reality it's fake reality okay you can

243
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:12,289
think what happen if the presence of the

244
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:15,349
US oh the president of UK before she

245
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:17,509
left is meeting with someone that she's

246
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:21,349
not supposed to meet and this picture is

247
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:23,209
is transferred all over the world do you

248
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,720
know if it's the real picture or the

249
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:29,868
fake picture the next thing is also

250
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,629
reaching humans okay so I mean I'm not

251
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:34,609
just talking about pacemaker and insulin

252
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,439
farm which is again also controlled by

253
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:38,629
the Internet and if you want to hurt

254
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:40,608
someone you can definitely do an attack

255
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:43,569
on them via the internet but I'm also

256
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:46,129
talking about simple things like we are

257
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:50,799
handling well this is actually harmless

258
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:55,039
but we are having our telephones and our

259
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:57,169
watches that control our variable

260
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,569
devices and you can do a lot of damage

261
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:05,959
with them especially if you follow them

262
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:08,419
very very devotee okay so that is going

263
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:11,419
to be the next to the next frontier and

264
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:16,159
and again without if when installing a

265
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:19,489
chip in your brain okay so we saw the

266
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,240
trends and now I want to talk about the

267
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,240
opportunity

268
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,940
and opportunities to and what do we have

269
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,410
to as the good guys and again I don't

270
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,150
want to get tuned into philosophy who is

271
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,890
the good guys on the bad guys but let's

272
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,990
assume for now that the good guys are

273
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:38,210
the one that are the that are that are

274
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,900
developing the all the defense systems

275
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:45,680
in order to in order to stop all those

276
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:49,100
criminals and why the cloud is such an

277
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,989
important part of that okay so first of

278
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,640
all we talked about the threats but this

279
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,960
is how your typical how a typical

280
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,370
enterprise look like it's not the cozy

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,730
on-prem environment that we used to have

282
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,250
in the past by definition your company

283
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:09,320
if you're if if you want to leverage all

284
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,420
the all the advantages that this open

285
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,100
wall has to offer you it's going to be

286
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,130
part in the cloud it's going to be have

287
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,800
that part of in SAS supply chain which

288
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,680
is distributed so how it's usually look

289
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,380
now this is a night if you would show it

290
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,390
to a SISO ten years ago they think that

291
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,990
we are totally crazy and this is a

292
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,080
nightmare

293
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,210
but this is how it looks okay and giving

294
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,790
with all the threats that we had before

295
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:39,310
it's becoming much more difficult to

296
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:45,319
defend such an unpredictable dynamic and

297
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:48,199
distributed environment and before I say

298
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,930
I say why the cloud I still want to say

299
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,360
that there is a lot of fear from the

300
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:57,469
cloud and if you will ask the server

301
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,570
that day and if you ask the average

302
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,530
person them said oh I'm Prem is so much

303
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:06,050
important if I want to to protect my

304
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,970
assets so first of all don't confuse me

305
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,920
with the facts most of the attacks that

306
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,110
happen happen on their own Prem but

307
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,260
that's not the only reason the only

308
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,080
reason and I'll get into the reason but

309
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:21,230
before that let me focus on the concerns

310
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,950
from the cloud okay so the first

311
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,660
complaint the first concern is obviously

312
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,340
management and visibility it's very

313
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,500
complex like if we saw before because

314
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,190
everything is distributed everything is

315
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,320
dynamic your wonder you have three

316
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,380
VMs on the cloud the next day you might

317
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,980
have 100 it's it's elastic it's it's

318
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:44,290
it's really really very elusive it's

319
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,389
really also very difficult to understand

320
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,699
what we have in the cloud and the

321
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:51,759
management sometimes it's complex etc

322
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:56,139
and of course the attacks are continued

323
00:15:51,759 --> 00:16:00,130
to grow and and also cloud specific

324
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:02,139
attacks okay so all these concerns if we

325
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,730
want to make sure that we leverage what

326
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,459
we have in the cloud we have to address

327
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,720
them so let's look at several of the

328
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:14,469
things okay so cloud Nai now to make

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,490
cloud in the eye and it's not and it's

330
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:21,730
not a coincidence that i'm the city over

331
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:25,630
the cloud and AI security because i see

332
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,029
cloud and AI going and we had what you

333
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,610
can do with an eye on the cloud you

334
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:34,779
cannot do on the eye on the on premise

335
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:37,149
or in a closed environment and that's

336
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,160
why to me they are going together but

337
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:41,949
let's see of some of the some of the

338
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,529
advantages that the cloud and evolu in

339
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:47,920
this fight and again it's a fight it's a

340
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:50,740
war it's a war against the the criminals

341
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,019
that are that are trying to steal that

342
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,510
are trying to change that are trying to

343
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:59,740
do all the things that we would like to

344
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,630
avoid okay so first of all as I said we

345
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,559
need to provide visibility a good cloud

346
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:07,750
has and they have and we and they cloud

347
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,220
providers has the ability to give you

348
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,890
the visibility of the things that you

349
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,610
have just take care for so first of all

350
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:19,150
to to solve the visibility issue the

351
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,158
second thing is to make sure that you

352
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,309
leverage the cloud which sees a lot of

353
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:28,120
information and collect a lot of this

354
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,980
data and analyze it from all sources not

355
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,699
only security data I'll give you an

356
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,809
example and in the cloud and if you keep

357
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,240
your data in the cloud it's very easy to

358
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,158
access for example you already are or

359
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,570
travel system if they happen to be in

360
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:48,080
the cloud now if

361
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,210
someone right now in Tel Aviv right but

362
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:57,980
most of the time I'm not myself I'm at

363
00:17:50,210 --> 00:18:00,049
least 50% in my of my stay is in Redmond

364
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,380
because Redmond is where the Galactic

365
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:05,629
hub where the where the headquarters

366
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,279
Microsoft and I'm there a lot okay so

367
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,440
let's say that today and I have an

368
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,980
office there as well so let's lay that

369
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,059
today someone who was posing as McHale

370
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,889
okay is trying to go into my account in

371
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,139
the Redmond office and they have the

372
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,789
perfect they stolen

373
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:24,830
somehow they stole all my credential

374
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:26,899
somehow okay it's difficult but summer

375
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,389
let's say that some somehow they did it

376
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:32,360
but if the security system knows how to

377
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:35,330
access the travel oh and McHale is

378
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,610
actually not in the red one today she is

379
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,120
in Tel Aviv she traveled to Tel Aviv so

380
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,039
that's clear that this is that this is a

381
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,439
criminal attack okay so that's why the

382
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,019
collective data and all the system not

383
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,120
just the security but your operational

384
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:53,200
system are extremely important and in

385
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:59,120
the cloud it's very easy to connect them

386
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,860
the next thing is it's also cheaper to

387
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:09,289
do it long term but I will not get into

388
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:11,240
it and another thing is that you can you

389
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:15,529
can connect a lot of the things together

390
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,240
and let me focus off on the light thing

391
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,830
which is the cloud effect so a lot of

392
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,450
the things you can sell now you can do

393
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,059
it also in their own Prime yes you can

394
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,940
do it but it's difficult what we really

395
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:28,250
you cannot do in their own Prem and you

396
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,049
can do only in the cloud is what I call

397
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,820
the what I call that is it's a variety

398
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,590
of features which I call the cloud

399
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,809
effect and let me just give you one

400
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,730
example but there are many more that I'm

401
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,070
happy to talk with you afterwards okay

402
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,850
so one thing which is really unique to

403
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:46,009
the cloud okay so let's say we discover

404
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,500
you know in the cloud and the cloud

405
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:50,659
providers have many tenants okay let's

406
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,330
say that we discovered an attack on one

407
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:56,330
tenant and we marked the digital

408
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,939
fingerprints of this attacker now this

409
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,550
attacker will now attempt to

410
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,390
attack more tenants however because we

411
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:09,669
identified is or her digital favorites

412
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:11,990
we will instantly in real time now

413
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,540
stop the attack to the rest of the

414
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,700
tunnel not you cannot do it the media

415
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,490
the real-time sharing you really cannot

416
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,320
do it in in their own prime now to me

417
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,330
and and not only to me away we will

418
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,389
think we almost we would even

419
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:30,740
mathematically for the interested party

420
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:33,410
I can show it is that it's not only if

421
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,580
you put your data only in the cloud it's

422
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,440
more secure that's no-brainer but what

423
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:43,100
is really important to understand that

424
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,910
that security systems that are developed

425
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,139
in the cloud in order to protect on Prem

426
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,300
in other words you are talking about

427
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,460
hybrid system you get a much better

428
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,889
security in the cloud because you can

429
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,170
leverage all the things that I saw

430
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,200
before and that's why the on Prem is

431
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,990
benefiting as well is now I think that

432
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,060
in five years 90% of the what we do will

433
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,950
be in the cloud but let's say that I'm

434
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,190
wrong and it's going to be ten years so

435
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,310
we are going to live in a hybrid world

436
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,580
for a long time still to consume

437
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:18,950
security analytics systems that are in

438
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,290
the cloud that would pets your hybrid

439
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:27,280
environment both their own Prem cloud in

440
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:27,280
other clouds this is the way to go ok

441
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm coming from Microsoft I just want to

442
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,790
give you some numbers of just now to put

443
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,010
some color on that ok so again it's not

444
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,530
only Microsoft other cloud providers can

445
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,770
do it as well if they focus on security

446
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,540
but let's look at at the numbers ok so I

447
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,250
think the numbers are quite impressive

448
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:56,590
okay so we have 500 million active users

449
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:59,240
ok we have 18 billion ok Microsoft

450
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,750
account that are authenticated every day

451
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:08,230
this is a daily this is the daenam

452
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:11,990
numbers we have 150 million attempts to

453
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,410
fake identity that you do every day

454
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,010
every

455
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,970
and of course we stopped 37 million new

456
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,600
threats every day

457
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:25,750
so this numbers on a daily okay on their

458
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:32,209
daily tanks on a daily a on a daily

459
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:34,970
basis all of it goes on into our ICC

460
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,370
system and as you know what's machine

461
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,320
learning is really leverage the data in

462
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,330
our in order to promote prediction to

463
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,780
the future now predictive of the future

464
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:47,720
is difficult especially as neil board

465
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:52,100
said okay but the more data you have and

466
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,290
the more quality a qualitative data you

467
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,120
have you can make it a better prediction

468
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,159
your eye system can make a better

469
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,379
detection and the cloud with these

470
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,200
numbers give us the ability to build

471
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,730
very exact predictions because one of

472
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,700
the biggest challenges of computer of

473
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:14,510
security system is not is not only to

474
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,400
detect the the threats and to handle

475
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,980
them but to make sure that the false

476
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,720
positive is very low because it because

477
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,120
otherwise it's crying wolf wolf and

478
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,850
nobody will will take you seriously

479
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,250
that's why the big data enable us not

480
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:31,730
only to grow up very high in detection

481
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,620
but to go very slow I mean but to go

482
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,510
very low on false positive and that's

483
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:42,320
what makes it very effective in the

484
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:45,710
cloud okay so let's continue and just to

485
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,220
summarize so a new art of war is needed

486
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,560
and and that out of war we need to

487
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,240
leverage intelligent very highly we need

488
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,360
to leverage machine learning and

489
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,820
analytics and partnership and this is a

490
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,939
segue to why communities is so important

491
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:05,389
partnership between vendors partnership

492
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,340
between communities because like in any

493
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:10,040
war and as I said already it's a war

494
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:16,699
coalition is very important it cannot be

495
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:19,010
won by itself and and the cloud powered

496
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,310
by the cloud makes it really the way to

497
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:25,639
go okay the next thing I want to talk

498
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,349
about is why communities

499
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:30,439
not answer it's obviously a rhetoric

500
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:34,999
question so communicative is very

501
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,649
important okay as I said and I want to

502
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:40,729
talk about a few of the things that we

503
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:45,408
are doing specific in Microsoft in order

504
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:47,509
to make sure that we that that we

505
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:49,279
leverage this huge power of communities

506
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:52,700
in order to make sure we build better

507
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,809
security system so the first thing is

508
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,259
API Hey almost all of our products have

509
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:03,259
API access rights spi etcetera that you

510
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:06,679
can leverage and increase them because

511
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:09,320
no matter what good work we do you buy

512
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,739
if you can expand them by open source or

513
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,559
by adding to it it will be better we

514
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:18,649
also have the Microsoft graph API which

515
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:21,200
is something relatively new which we

516
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:24,079
expose to you a lot of the threats that

517
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,489
we internally found so not only you can

518
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:31,339
leverage API but you can also leverage

519
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:34,999
the finding and therefore by I build a

520
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:38,779
better solution and I think the product

521
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:41,599
that we developed are easily expandable

522
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:44,529
the most the most recent one is sentinel

523
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:48,439
by the way which is one of my babies I

524
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:51,519
initiated and also as a security center

525
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,519
is another baby but all the one and

526
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:57,799
sentinels not only is a great analytics

527
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,309
and a new generation same in the cloud

528
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:04,219
but it's also expandable and it adds you

529
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:06,729
easily to add more and more components

530
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:12,529
that you can develop by yourself and

531
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:14,659
make sure that it customize to your

532
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:18,919
environment to the specific problem that

533
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:21,619
you want to to solve and of course

534
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,019
github with the with the purchase of

535
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:27,678
github and it's connected now to all our

536
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:31,419
products so you can leverage github in

537
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,979
order to to to store share and

538
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:35,690
everything that that you developed make

539
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:38,700
sure that you hook to the right

540
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,770
communities and therefore by the betters

541
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,550
the better security solution so all of

542
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:54,150
it together gives you an ecosystem that

543
00:26:44,550 --> 00:27:00,000
it's very easy okay so okay what I want

544
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:04,260
to actually end this talk and also maybe

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,240
open it to questions I want because it's

546
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,810
awesome because you guys are also

547
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,970
looking on the next frontier not only

548
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,100
from technology but what you should

549
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:18,780
contribute so I want to give you a few

550
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,610
ideas so the first thing is edge

551
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,950
computing I know you guys are already

552
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,919
looking at IOT and Allsop is talking

553
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,070
about IOT edge etc but edge computing is

554
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,930
much more than IOT it's really

555
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:35,760
leveraging the control that you can get

556
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:39,480
from the cloud but make the edge in the

557
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,030
on Prem and then with close connection

558
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,410
to the cloud much more intelligent okay

559
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:49,980
so it's it's really optimizing the fact

560
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:53,430
that we have a strong edge in the on

561
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:57,510
Prem constantly connected to to the

562
00:27:53,430 --> 00:28:02,190
cloud but can be controlled the level of

563
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:05,670
Independence and sharing and how do you

564
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,530
really do it correctly so we have a lot

565
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,300
of ideas but I think that we already

566
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:15,690
just scratch the tip of the iceberg and

567
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,330
and I think it's it's a great and it's a

568
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,010
great challenge for you this community

569
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,360
in order to think about solution because

570
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:26,400
it's a lot of problems there that are

571
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,469
unique to this situation it's not really

572
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,960
just cloud it's not really just on Prem

573
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:33,690
it's not really just a coyote and you

574
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,270
have to deep to go deep dive into it and

575
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:39,540
you will hopefully you'll have a lot of

576
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,850
great ideas the second of interesting

577
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,520
thing is functions and functions and

578
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:47,659
serve role as many and lambda in AWS

579
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:51,090
again it's not only from Microsoft its

580
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:54,419
securing lambda both on the attacks and

581
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,730
and servers and functions both of their

582
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,129
attacks and also the way you secure it

583
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:02,190
it's different than you secure VM it's

584
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:04,320
different than you secure just says even

585
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,149
containers okay so it's a lot of

586
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,178
research there that still need to be

587
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:15,498
done and and again another opportunity

588
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:18,990
for this community to go deep and and

589
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:22,049
and help and be innovative and the last

590
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,879
thing is the API economy we all know

591
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:26,700
about wealth Web Application Firewall

592
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:29,969
and all those older generation

593
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,619
protection it's not enough because right

594
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,619
now everything is so focused on the

595
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:38,699
application on the API so if you just

596
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:41,549
leverage the infrastructure the way of

597
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,269
the path to to look at gateways to look

598
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:48,690
at proxy etc it's not enough you have to

599
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:51,090
be really focused on the API economy API

600
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,720
management and this again a new from

601
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:57,689
frontier and this again something that

602
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:01,440
generates a lot of new ideas and that's

603
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:07,289
why I I would like to make sure that we

604
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:10,710
get help from you guys okay so I try to

605
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:14,759
do it very fast do we have time from two

606
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:18,590
minutes okay so any questions that happy

607
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,590
to answer any questions now later

608
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,960
nope hello there we go thank you for

609
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,060
that one thing that really resonated

610
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,120
with me that you mentioned earlier on

611
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:43,129
and then elaborated on a bit was this

612
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,699
idea of collecting all of the data and

613
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,710
being able to apply AI to detect threats

614
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,010
in your environment and the example you

615
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,480
gave is let's say you're not in Redmond

616
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,800
being able to pull data from your travel

617
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,660
and all of that correct

618
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,790
so one thing I wonder though is that the

619
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,470
the current state of being able to

620
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:06,980
detect threats is already lagging behind

621
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,750
you know 99 days or so to detect an apt

622
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,580
in your environment and all of these

623
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,720
other analytics that are right there in

624
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,120
front of us but we're not leveraging

625
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,160
what is that kind of middle point

626
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,919
between where we the sad place where we

627
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,100
are today and that ideal place where

628
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,810
we're actually able to use AI to ingest

629
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,209
and analyze all that data so what is

630
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:29,179
that kind of that practical ok I think I

631
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,520
got the questions so I try to have it so

632
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,910
first of all just about the 99 dates

633
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,280
okay that the average apt exists in the

634
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:40,490
corporate net okay the fact that that

635
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,010
exists there is bad but this is not the

636
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,080
worst the worst is when they get to the

637
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,360
holy grail and for them the holy grail

638
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,169
is what they are tempted with because

639
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,240
they to penetrate the networking is just

640
00:31:51,170 --> 00:32:00,050
a means to an end you have to understand

641
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:04,250
what they were actually after now if so

642
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:07,310
and the success of the defense is if we

643
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,320
stop them not of course we want to stop

644
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,270
the penetration but this is almost

645
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,090
impossible if they really want to

646
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:18,530
penetrate their will in some way that

647
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:20,449
they were very successful fifth no

648
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,160
matter how your castle is closed they

649
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,460
will be able to penetrate your castle

650
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,740
okay the important thing is that you

651
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,830
will stop them before they actually get

652
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,210
to the Rembrandt to dolly whatever is

653
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,540
stored in you or whatever they want to

654
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:38,390
store okay and that's exactly the why

655
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:42,370
the continuous monitoring of what

656
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:45,260
happening inside your network and inside

657
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:48,229
Enterprise is important okay so let's

658
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,660
say that there was even already an apt

659
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:54,070
which means it exists in my regressive

660
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:57,170
aggregation undetected for let's say

661
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,669
ninety eight days okay but that we

662
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,950
really want they wanted to steal my

663
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,080
credentials and if at that point when

664
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:06,620
they made the mistake and the access

665
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,649
their a and and because we access the

666
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,510
travel system we were able to stop it at

667
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,520
that point we discover it and we stopped

668
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,870
the whole attack okay so that's why it's

669
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:25,760
extremely important thing that I was

670
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:27,560
answer the question okay okay sorry so

671
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,260
we we don't have any more time but we

672
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:33,820
can get questions at the coffee break

673
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,820
that's coming right now
