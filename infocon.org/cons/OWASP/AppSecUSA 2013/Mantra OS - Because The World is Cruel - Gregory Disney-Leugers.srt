1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,710
my name is Gary Disney liners I went to
Air Force Institute technology and

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,660
Defense Acquisition University

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,490
by study I T in project management from
that pretty much I

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,609
started Linux development for secure
systems

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,439
and that's where mantra comes to players
I develop mantra pretty much

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,810
to ensure that we and user could have a
secure virtualized platform to past

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,839
and be able to pretty much at the end as
their test case

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,450
shutdown flush it and then to redeploy
no bf the Camry 2.0 therefore you can

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,580
restart your session pretty much exactly

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,700
that was the idea via sandboxing through
artsy

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm so pretty much about

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,180
me a little bit more as I am apart from
security engineer

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,270
at high trust had trust builds cloud
security

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,290
and compliance testing a promote
compliance

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,730
and what I do is I use mantra to break
it

16
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,820
ago and I punch in the face every day

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,000
that is my job so when I have to do is
pretty much

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,240
figure out what a black hat would do to
the system

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,920
and that is in theory seems like it
would be more

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,920
difficult than it

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,409
there's but in reality I'm for being a
black hat is

22
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,210
I want controls I want to be able to
take over everything

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,020
that's all black I really want is the
data from not so

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,840
what we do is we pretty much guarantee
the security of different appliances

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,080
inside your the cloud so I had to make
sure that

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,590
three dollars they cannot attack our
appliance so

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,280
what is meant to us men traverses
advertise attack platform

28
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,780
designed around the mantra security
token head and I'll austerity repository

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,780
on the I am security okay it was about
by

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,549
get mantra which is on I'm and busty
beauty even posit re: is Matt resource

31
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,959
and and the Commission does to me

32
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,959
pretty much created a independent OS
Metro us was the vote for Scott testing

33
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,580
professional pen testing environment

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,310
and has been really optimize over the
last yr year-and-a-half

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,770
far promotes virtual environments a one
from

36
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,849
pretty much a distribution to a virtual
appliance and over a year

37
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,319
driven we said joan anybody that wants
to because also

38
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,510
on our user base 75 percent men
transistors are virtualized so it seemed

39
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,319
to me as

40
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,330
the best route to goal was to virtualize
said

41
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,390
even further Tim guarantee integration
between desktops and

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,069
that VMware ecosystem um

43
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,470
it is about one I so noob a.m. which is
an ass and I

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,860
standard so that fits compliance not
sounds

45
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,220
I am how I implemented

46
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,290
mantra lesson to hide trust was pretty
much through

47
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,110
they hired me and and they said we want
security

48
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,930
cue track so I said okay I'm

49
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,980
some very much I am

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,319
decide mantra would be my best course
because I knew it inside out because I

51
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,540
was the developer on that

52
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,650
and from there have I had implements cap

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,849
and other testing protocols so have a
compliance PCI compliance

54
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,230
different components housing and
security so

55
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,870
one we send out to a customer and they
say

56
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,140
we help them keep combines our product
itself is compliant

57
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,519
Tom pretty much we Aussies are from $1
billion verification testing through its

58
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,190
mess

59
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,750
pollen and other back and spat pretty
much exploit

60
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,860
a I did put a previous owner and

61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,360
it's pretty much you will see on the
demo how its integrated with the desktop

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,550
environment I love

63
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,180
VMware so

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,879
I redo I designed for McConnell up

65
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,840
the first thing I did was give the GR
security kernel patch what's the kernel

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,340
patch

67
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,180
actually gives a pretty much like I am

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,269
the model insight com gives an extra
security so

69
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,389
you can't do bad things to the server
itself

70
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,790
I also game open VZ chrome which axe for
dispatch

71
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,150
as a virtualization and job task handler

72
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,949
and I use a generally crappy cluster
with KVM to ensure that

73
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,340
if you wanted builders of into a team
server you could be easily do that

74
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,280
and have model partial answers Bay stop
the gas filesystem

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,270
a mantra us so that would make it easier
for

76
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,840
an enterprise situation for testers to
user

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,910
and then show us has

78
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,340
currently running three containers and
two sandboxes on every desktop

79
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,960
and since then is running so I use open
VZ

80
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,790
as they contain a controller for ok seem

81
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,060
and then rushers pretty much the

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,110
1.00 match OS had a sandbox

83
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,870
but then I said we can go further with
us so

84
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,370
when I did as I took that pretty much
that D Bus hug and I'm

85
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,250
many into wanna go still IDM

86
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,310
the pretty much goes the whole desktop a
sandbox

87
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,770
and penitent pretty much controlled
delivered for Joomla

88
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,180
GMC insurers that any and the see

89
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,860
pile compiled programs are sandboxed and
are pretty much starting Tampa and

90
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,430
flushed

91
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,860
at shutdown so this is

92
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,729
virtual core its quite large for

93
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,830
virgil cooper um basically

94
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,900
below if I and biases bare metal 'em
that doesn't particularly matter in this

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,840
case

96
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,250
so there's enough I BIOS I use grub2

97
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,169
big ramps and the been busy Khanom

98
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,669
been the Jan 19 and the music control
talks

99
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,690
via the genetic cluster 2 Kb I'm Tim

100
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,220
and then liberal ensures that the lupine
is constant

101
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,770
and the dust out is pretty much the PBS
and a vet for the Alex ease so

102
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,400
when the task is called a bike such a
shutdown when you have this many Birch

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,430
Run

104
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,100
processes running shutting down is
actually quite a task because as Intel

105
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,500
each of those virtual and scissors it
has to shut down

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,789
so pretty much live dispatch goes
through all those layers and Sons

107
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,830
initial 0r mission 11 every maybe

108
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,570
to give it the task I'm shutting down

109
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,340
so I was shown a demo how the IPS is
working but a

110
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,539
I gave IDS and IPS solution the IDS
answer Cana

111
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,030
which is like smart but a open see also

112
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,660
gives you a lot larger dynamic have
workspace

113
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,880
monitoring your ideas I also use are
totally in honey from my ideas

114
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,039
and watch that does is actually enables

115
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,789
the honeyed is set to make it look like
an eye as summer

116
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,479
and artillery gives that they can a
Sharpie seaports and all that stuff to

117
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,680
make a little look like it is. armor

118
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,370
I also it has contain a base and boxing
which are covered

119
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,699
then I also a minute Obama an ass Yonex
so

120
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,600
in something was to go around like a say
I Palmer will protect Firefox

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,550
because if you're running a social
engineering you don't wanna get your

122
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,699
browser per se hoped

123
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,919
at Parmer will try to protect that Tom

124
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,569
so this is the security audit talk had
bad I'm

125
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,880
pretty much worked out the with WT with
Matt ends at Bourbon

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,030
multi ego metal spoon armitage

127
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,880
which I'm intense slashed MSF gimme and

128
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
ends on map which is an maps Q me

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,849
also I asked the last week matter add

130
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,460
access our which is legs in a tax
project but for

131
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,650
1x I we have for packet capture

132
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,789
either cap and Wireshark your cap

133
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,770
is pretty much the burpee capetown
dollars

134
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,560
brentwood also there's also helps those
benefit us by showing us what happens

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,550
the ideas ideas one it is

136
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,389
properly running we have

137
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,429
for web applications Gunners we have
Skype session cutone Priory

138
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:42,429
single injection we have sequel brew
segal map and sickle map integration

139
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,550
entire collection multi ego now the fun
part we actually get to

140
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,869
pack some stuff on

141
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:54,370
welcome

142
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,300
as you can see on this one that ire de

143
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,750
set up a scam this is a website hosted
by Tom Lehrer so

144
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,650
you might know when you stumble after
seeing this but that it has cross-eyed

145
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,780
scripting

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,130
massive amount possible sequel gentle
points

147
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,960
after testing I can tell you fact shale
uses Oracle database even though its own

148
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,450
post-crescent hypersonic

149
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,940
and pretty much lemme

150
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,620
with Mercy Corps injection and the cross
site scripting

151
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,370
this site is one more formal ones I
could find so I thought it was ideal for

152
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,130
demo and

153
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:38,130
com

154
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,890
so much that I use as my primary a

155
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,290
scanner to see when I'm can do to this

156
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,360
any application I'm scanning so what I
did as

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,900
pretty much now I'm going to do is a
sequel map injection

158
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,990
the Oracle Preminger and said the

159
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,340
database management software to Oracle
so that

160
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:09,340
hopefully in theory we can get some date
out a lot

161
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:17,170
yeah

162
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,499
love

163
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:29,499
and

164
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,630
so pretty much this is telling yet I am
using the database

165
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,620
my dad indeed that but I database to
Oracle and hamper

166
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,860
I mean is the timbre between to ensure
that I can I get an

167
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,920
tampering

168
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,180
pretty much receive amount I film

169
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,580
Tom that's not good

170
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,270
well I'm gonna sit out this time

171
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,340
on

172
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,420
lemme okay so pretty much is gonna try
to inject into this

173
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,510
them photo

174
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,820
why this photo is particularly
vulnerable is

175
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,250
they are all reflect the values inside
their database

176
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,860
someone I inject the photo itself I'm
actually

177
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,010
doing reflective injection into their
mark a database

178
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,870
on um pretty much

179
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,190
but you can see their springs detected
and all that which means

180
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,540
its pretty bad Tom

181
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,990
when in Jackson that would be we'll be
able to get

182
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,430
cheese and a couple other things but I
don't think it's gonna

183
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:54,430
work man I'm Tom there is make it home

184
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,940
them

185
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,400
which is gonna try to do the scan on

186
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,090
and as you can see it's are defining
final tumbler stuff

187
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,330
inside the contents now West

188
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,280
that s pretty much we can take some
today have

189
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,740
that we found from Sat and other things
like such an icky dome

190
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,490
a blended as we have to generate some
report because people are gonna have to

191
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,440
mention the on and I just on this

192
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,960
information and they re and at that
point

193
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,260
we have to figure out how to me can take
all other than information and

194
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,400
information poss

195
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,290
other tools I use and how we can make
them to a collective

196
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,720
information for rent to share so how

197
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,570
I'm personal and it was everything here
is

198
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,730
inside the virtual appliance because big

199
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,610
June between the dust-up so I can
actually take the information I found

200
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,550
pretty much moved to it my Mac

201
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,750
on its desktop and write a report so
that

202
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,920
its no bounce between no emails no not
trying to get

203
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,980
two devices work at the same time

204
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,640
mom those of us on the other half on

205
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,610
when you're trying to such as on

206
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,230
on see what's going on I'm

207
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,270
stood

208
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,499
who

209
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:32,799
when you're running attack I lidija keep
your browser up to see

210
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,829
I'm knocking it down like Simmons action

211
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,079
if it's heading the wrong point and can
cause and now serves because this is a

212
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,709
lotta traffic going on

213
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,659
you can be making thousands a request
and so usually

214
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,790
a monitor the website

215
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,100
this nation and its not down

216
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,600
cousins down and Benny thing I clocked
elements gonna be pretty much

217
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,700
lost because it's gonna be bad advancing
was in Jackson's down it's going to mean

218
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,610
bad data

219
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,600
suppose that's so on I wasn't sure that

220
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm some other things that user should
be where I am

221
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,860
is pretty much on

222
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,810
mantra originally came with tar but
because of the large security risk

223
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,450
poor sense it's been used as a CNC
another bad

224
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,980
things have been going for it it became
a decision on

225
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,250
when I mean from was being implemented
into a.m. prices you Asian

226
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,700
do you really want war right now towards

227
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,980
back door to a lot about things so

228
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,100
it came as a decision now were not been
implemented I'm

229
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,230
and mr. because that does bad things so
well

230
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,640
at the end result is your IP does not

231
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,130
changes does not have proxy anymore but
your actual

232
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,900
identity as a service has been modified

233
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,870
this memorable very rarely show up as a
proper London Cyrus

234
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,400
so the idea that is it was to be
fingerprinted

235
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,690
by some I can I D S IPS they would
pretty much

236
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:17,690
not be able to figure out what you are

237
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,009
services what it looks like be four it
actually has

238
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:29,350
the IPS running it only few services GD
oh man I'm

239
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,709
pretty much a squid proxy servers

240
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:37,939
and a couple other things running around

241
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:39,970
on

242
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:46,970
on

243
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,500
on

244
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,490
you know we will we brown not last stand

245
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:00,490
years

246
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,550
something I am a lot more ports open

247
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,560
the there is no way after a Tory is
running night

248
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,430
bukan positively fingerprint the service

249
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,230
because when it runs its going to

250
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,279
give such a large trainings a from the
finger printing service on the other end

251
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,399
it won't be able to the tact some

252
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,250
on

253
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,259
how's that me sir colors

254
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,839
as you can see on the other end on

255
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,620
pretty much a the gym setting the
connections every time there and map

256
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,970
servers running through

257
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,790
so one we attack be pretty much
fingerprinting and

258
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,180
by parts can I can actually do that and
also at

259
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,620
added parts can attack defender so if
there's an

260
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,519
active parts can eventually if you keep
on running have never never never never

261
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,300
again I'm

262
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,269
it becomes not available the houses down
to that user

263
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:06,880
they cannot see it so the theory is if
you were able to bridge into and network

264
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,130
and they were trying to figure out what
you are doing

265
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,380
while you're running now's you could
they would never be able to produce a

266
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,919
figure out crew are where you are your
Geo

267
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,439
your goip location because on

268
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,169
beneath the my guess would be a fun goip
but everything else

269
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,839
the pretty much be looking for Windows
box and I S server

270
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,750
which is not the case at all and the
idea is

271
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,120
tried to be communion Joan way to pretty
much

272
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,970
send out flyers and try to protect
yourself when you bring to not work

273
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,750
because

274
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,620
there's one thing they want to do is
kick you off the network when you're not

275
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,320
supposed to be there

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,040
and as you can see this is now
injectable by twenty columns

277
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,190
and pretty much it has

278
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,180
wanna buy technique serve the database
the very bottom want to see

279
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,990
injection as you can see simple map is
great for nerd

280
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,890
enterprise solution because it automated
out to a point that

281
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,000
if you have a single a database was
called session that Siebel I

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,680
you seceded in the test and if you do
not you founded

283
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,010
spree simplistic and then you can see my
daily ashtec's or trade an

284
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,580
bomb

285
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,770
see more there's also

286
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,740
other tools included such as burp

287
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,670
Tom bamut engine

288
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:39,670
on that too but

289
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,490
I'm some

290
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,760
at this point does anybody have any
questions

291
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,149
on

292
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:06,149
ok I'm on

293
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,070
slowed stop translate script and I'm now

294
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,700
on

295
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,389
okay snow on this one

296
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,019
bomb much out of things to say

297
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,169
hey so dozens mantra sure the seat here

298
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,299
offend but downey I highly recommend the
stalls at

299
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,040
I've used it for my mommy's model times

300
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,570
um it I have been able to breach willem

301
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,840
Twitter once and pretty much

302
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,320
everything you need to do

303
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,420
bugged down is now everything else that
you would wanna do

304
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,470
you could do with this operating system
and

305
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,230
be complete virtualize sandbox and
secure while you're running these

306
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,120
attacks

307
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,350
and that's the whole idea mantra is to
sum up as

308
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,430
a tool that is virtualized for

309
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,750
attacking and then collecting data and
being able to disseminate it down

310
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,660
because majority unless you're going for
by have wench

311
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,840
by all means and just use backtrack

312
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,410
that pretty much means be used this
before

313
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,990
the information that you need to give to
premature higher-ups be like that so I

314
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,930
breach our site this is how I did it

315
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,240
and that's when I use manager for I
think that's about all I how

316
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,200
so and impressions

317
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,440
and pretty much Island things The site

318
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,750
sour on

319
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,150
how does it differ from backtracked
pretty much a

320
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,460
the browser itself as an A grade and as
them

321
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,690
the buzz itself is an interview with the
mansion token

322
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,180
and then on top of that no tools are
parted wget repository which

323
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,700
aren't and to be more stable band

324
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,940
per se backtrack which is when and where
people are submitting each year

325
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,180
and that the idea is to give you a
stable

326
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:17,180
an automated palm operating system

327
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,960
mom

328
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,059
on ok a lost art mantra laos

329
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,860
that's where the virtual pines and
there's also the ice is on SourceForge

330
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,750
you

331
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,840
K yet they made at the remote

332
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,760
attended when he once more new owners
that

333
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,870
abductee made at the most so bean

334
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,040
IPS small my question these this

335
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,480
and then any of their mode so or any
other

336
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,200
where you can switch around the if you
don't deny a summer

337
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,900
you could be an Apache one reason I
chose

338
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,680
something that was not was because if
you can spoof being a Windows service is

339
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,960
being spiffing an Apache server

340
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,490
they're gonna be looking for something
completely different and the Beast at

341
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,000
hand

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,680
they're going to be looking for this is.
server that's attacking but in reality

343
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,130
its elements

344
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,940
engine access when Sir attacking on

345
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,730
well looks looks really cool me said
like it last year you're happy worked on

346
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,010
it

347
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,299
mean how often you updates what's a
long-term plan

348
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,350
if there is any barriers arms we have an
annual release planned

349
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,950
technically each one is underway very
long term support

350
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,260
I am every year under revision because
things do change

351
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,350
and the Linux kernel is a member
expensive project that is always growing

352
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,690
so every summer I pretty much go through
a release cycle

353
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,690
and them a release is about October
every year

354
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,900

355
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,499

356
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:04,100
