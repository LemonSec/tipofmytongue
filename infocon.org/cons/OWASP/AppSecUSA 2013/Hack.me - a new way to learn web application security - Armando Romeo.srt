1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,279
hi everybody I were you good

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,700
know this but investing in about Hockney
a new way to learn web application

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,430
security

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,260
you work the in decided not just about
learning

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,510
so much more I we will have 20 minutes a
live demonstration here

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,610
say so I'll things will go

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,940
ride already well from fun I

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,710
but very few words about me before we
begin mining them in the mail I'm

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,360
on it security and as a web application
security and yes and

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,329
researcher for for a few years I

11
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,820
they found that you don't think you
that's my every day job and

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,720
from I repurposed many students here in
the room

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,829
incident occurred before the ones who
don't know that security up

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,260
and at the security training company I

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,540
where we don't end up the lever training
courses we r

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,950
more known for this sophisticated
virtual lab that we create

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,100
and one on this sophisticated missile
out will be

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
showcase today shock me I mmm

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,969
we are proud or what corporate member
yes of course i'm italian

20
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:11,100
usually cannot keep calm up to them lack
I am

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,340
can use this phrase safety the phrase
everywhere Twitter account and

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,429
I not yet maybe some 130

23
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:22,920
related to me not being on Facebook make
I'm gonna thing up next year

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,409
30 what happened member may bid

25
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,939
so added to the agenda for today when we
are going to this got that they wanted

26
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:31,479
Hockney

27
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,740
I we want to introduce the project
happen to find the project that I mean

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,279
if we did

29
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:39,450
for we're going to benefit from this of
popcorn

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,669
we will have about 10 minutes a
demonstration how you can use shock me

31
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:48,709
I'll we will tell you how it works white
sophisticated how we work

32
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,709
behind-the-scene I another them all

33
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:55,719
and then the question that probably
would be taken in the other room

34
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,899
okay so what you pack me about the
project I love me some information

35
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:06,009
before we begin a it's a project
creating the research and development

36
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:06,859
lab

37
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,670
in Pisa by UN Security from the work

38
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,380
thirty-month work someone might say
while than a month you might be dipped

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,790
to take

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,140
thirty-month to but known as there's a
lot behind the scene that we have done

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,700
few other things in this lot
thirty-month from

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,570
the better relief a but the lead was in
2012

43
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,100
out today we are going to relieve the
final version of the above this project

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,340
it's completely free

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,150
okay if they're up production of the
land security yet that the community so

46
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,790
everyone can use it for free

47
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,220
and be the domain name is talk about me
so you can

48
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,050
either private now even have it now
octave me if they're

49
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,270
you're aware you can access this kind of
virtual lab

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,540
pre for all so what it when you talk me

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,280
from when I started to think about this
project I wanted to create something

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,380
a easily accessible for everyone

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,990
wanting to learn web application
security hundred-person practical

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,450
on and the this is the kind of
definition they try to give

55
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,690
I Mac when we created this kind of
project

56
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,570
so what is an upstart everyone is an
upstart after the puck from where

57
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,520
everyone everywhere but developer can
create application

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,110
with them on this platform and then
anyone out

59
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,210
can install can download and install the
application is a senior at the what

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,510
happens with shock me

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,640
be tied to that we are going to Ron

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,510
vulnerable web application instead of my
application

63
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,040
right on so Hockney

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,710
is up popcorn were everyone especially
you that are in the field

65
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,319
all what I mean everyone knows about
with applications according to the room

66
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,530
maybe we also you up on some developer
hey everyone Camille

67
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,410
share and Ron abominable web application
when a free meal should I run a mean

68
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,800
that

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,470
you can you talk me through create your
vulnerable with application

70
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,100
share them with the others with the
community and them

71
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,520
everyone else run this and what number
well petitions

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,690
on the flight on the fly I admit that

73
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,529
by just clicking I Bachmann in your web
browser

74
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,519
I we were on your sandbox we'll see what
and Moxie is

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,249
where your 1 I'm aware of the cation is
is another view of the project so the

76
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,159
community to give

77
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:32,080
it if you basically so power user
someone who knows a MacBook

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,539
multiplication security I

79
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:38,740
create this scenario share them with an

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,770
shock me with a lot of our clouds
usually when is a cloud in a

81
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,479
presentation

82
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,939
with butter but if its release event
somewhere

83
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:51,150
in the cloud and we make them available
to the other

84
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,710
and within Sandbach environment isolated
environment so

85
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,129
a what cock need not and there's always
computing when we present this kind of

86
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,680
project not just virtual out what is a
versatile at every

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,689
IT security training company provides
virtual on where

88
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,870
well not all about I mean the good ones
provide you with a virtual lab where you

89
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,949
can practice

90
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,960
whenever you learn I use it is virtual
labs are networks

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,069
computer my web applications

92
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,330
hockey is not just that there's a lot
because it's much more

93
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,259
you get isolated access and you that
community driven

94
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:33,580
vessel out it's not just something that
I'm AP security training company

95
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,800
created and given to the other

96
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,449
it's like many people create an
contributes the creation on this

97
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:44,770
scenario there's nothing to download
okay not softer

98
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,939
I'll Mar Hockney before

99
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,289
think like these you wanted to practice

100
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,969
vulnerable with application you could
download install

101
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:59,309
I dunno a them vulnerable with
application for example very common on a

102
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,229
CD

103
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,589
time you can have your own local ever
and you can run this

104
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,680
wanna work make it on your pet in local

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,949
is all what may okay on

106
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,719
it's not up for hiking platform we don't
want this to be just a place where

107
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,080
I you know there are challenges can
capture the flag

108
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,349
want to be are learning environment

109
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,770
so we did for was injected into this

110
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,189
I'm sure well E the very first

111
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,499
I'm there would be a learner sup course
and even we are a key security training

112
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:34,639
company

113
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,349
but I we want to concentrate on the
other to the web application security

114
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:41,740
researchers and the penetration testers

115
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,089
ob that fake web application security
assessors

116
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,969
for example one happen you can find

117
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,409
many different versions of common of the
ship softer

118
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:56,830
that's a Joomla or let the WordPress
okay you wanna run

119
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,979
a particular alt version of WordPress
because he wanna run

120
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,960
any kinda wanna be with you assess are
any security research

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,669
how the security to the mall for example
in this him at the summertime

122
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,839
and you will Oct if you will find this
the print version of this

123
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,990
kalman applications on Hockney and you
will

124
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,219
run them with just a click 30 seconds
you will have your

125
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,960
your application you can even that
vulnerability

126
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,080
scanner on the flight since you will
have many different scenarios on the

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,089
platform

128
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:31,319
you can test how would this scanners are

129
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,349
against different applications

130
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,419
okay last one penetration tester

131
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,339
I'll let me make an example you are up
in a Christian pastor your client as a

132
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,389
out

133
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,779
by the non-human 1.5 you don't wanna run

134
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,439
I and one out build your own exploit on
the client

135
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,659
production environment you can find

136
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,969
I'll the environment on hot me or you
can recreate the environment

137
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:01,169
on happen if you know the environment
client environment

138
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,879
and you can do any kind of destructive

139
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,740
past on cock me before you do it on your
client

140
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,779
I'll production environment okay

141
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,759
so did the best part of heart me is that
you can destroy you can remove

142
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,419
5 drop table and stock crash whenever
you want

143
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,089
with just one arrest that Martin okay
your sandbox would be refitted from

144
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,399
anything well we want to

145
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,639
I'm avoid with this sophisticated
virtual lab

146
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,860
it but he could this situation okay
where to people or maybe not

147
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,180
people people in any mode Spain the same
resources share the same resources all

148
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,430
together

149
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,420
the the Pico all the majority of the
merch a lot that you find today

150
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,810
right when you have website when you
have networks

151
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,850
and where every you then I talked with a
network or the thing with application

152
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,970
this can bring a lot of problems for
example

153
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,670
they can disrupt your environment they
can include now we're

154
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,580
you will never find environment you are
supposed to find it right

155
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,680
so we hug me we I

156

199
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,250

one is mine

206
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,060
it means that up on the servers on the

207
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,130
on on this cloud there are many sandbox
for

208
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,020
these 10 but with the publication but
only this one is mine

209
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,090
so I'm going to access this handbook
tonight

210
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,460
can do whatever i won so this is my
scope my sandbox

211
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,540
10 book is my school discovering a
two-run double penetration test which is

212
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,620
basically did

213
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,680
so did the URL where I can access

214
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,730
did infant watercress okay

215
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,610
I we analyze a little bit this we have
hot of me

216
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,030
now are of course I want domain the
condom is one of the many service were

217
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,430
in the cloud where these

218
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,600
sandbox has been allocated there are
many servers

219
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,900
so according to their that you said we
moved it and look

220
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,810
around and this is your your your
sub-domain basically

221
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,910
okay related to be particular

222
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,560
sandbox a factory with them the
thermostat Beck 6-3 say that

223
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,740
you're not gonna do any damage operate
here

224
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,120
we will find work okay

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,540
we at our sandbox with alarm or press
running

226
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,020
on the flight with on a few seconds I
think it is the URL

227
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,820
and it is a a real work with a minute
not

228
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,910
strips out to eat out all the Fisher mmm
okay

229
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,050
your we can do whatever we want with
this and looks okay

230
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,010
dropped a ball remote file inclusion
whatever we want once we are done

231
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,770
we can just this draw a this sandbox

232
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:13,480
okay just a click away but no way to
create

233
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,540
isn't this all in Paris election a
wonderful web application on the fly

234
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,390
what I have prepared for this
presentation you know

235
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,710
okay

236
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,810
a it's a small application

237
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,210
called upset a carton

238
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,540
the military will show us

239
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,930
are very trivial example how we can

240
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,170
Armani play a web application okay
remove files stored up they both or just

241
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,130
change on the appearance on the web
application and now we can start fresh

242
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,190
once we have caused this damage okay

243
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:59,920
did causing damages is is normal when he
and when you're a breaker a penetration

244
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,140
test or or

245
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,470
even just the research right so

246
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,170
the purpose of the time because this to
me spread 13

247
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,320
needed and to start fresh K

248
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,450
it was possible because the number of
pilot the operations where

249
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,530
I'll lower so I agree with them

250
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,090
service the another family movie
American movie

251
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,290
that his appeal application K one number
with a pic

252
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,639
arm

253
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,120
0 no one is appended

254
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,709
no one from just as a friend here the

255
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:42,420
you go or the family yager okay did not
begin is trivial because they can put

256
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,459
anything here

257
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,240
and in the bar and

258
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,499
did ends up in a bow to me and the
message basically he read

259
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,600
read from the database very stupid right
the

260
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,360
this in a situation or person process
trippin okay

261
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,499
this one to show you how you can change
the appearance of the application

262
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,680
to a cross-site scripting I

263
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,449
and how you can restart the sandbox from
Fred up for

264
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:17,149
a just use this code they can manage
these

265
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,420
American Leo it

266
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,499
in

267
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:28,129
so

268
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:35,129
very simple okay this is we change the
message

269
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,279
okay

270
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,740
know what are you up in Apocalypse Now
you

271
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,130
said okay okay so we change the
appearance of his application right

272
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,089
the free reload the page the application

273
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,559
application with say the same because we
modify the database right

274
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,939
II didn't have the time to show you a
DROP TABLE

275
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,179
in this case because the time is limited
but it is

276
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,939
a way to change the appearance of the
application so and one save drop table

277
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,959
and promote pilots I am done

278
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,059
any kind of damage to my sandbox and
only to my fam book no one else would be

279
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,079
affected by this

280
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,250
right no one out having another them
back for this application

281
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,570
I can just click Reset we printed
destroying

282
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,820
now we now use the reset would reset
basically we

283
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,250
are going to not price with the
application

284
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,340
at the creator of this application for
policy to meet

285
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,360
once again we come back to the original
message

286
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,410
on the application that

287
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,809
close this on this

288
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,010
to rate this and and go back to our
presentation so

289
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,179
it is medically what up in boxes okay

290
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,640
way to isolate the environment how do we
have to defend a kiss a lot of work

291
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,960
that houses why the thirty-month so we
basically creating new operating system

292
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,640
users we create new web server user we

293
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
isolated three different layers be a
pregnancy spent with the perfect then

294
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,190
the web server and another me

295
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,790
this how we can abstract you know we

296
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,900
make sure that the application is
contained within

297
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,160
this sandbox once we have created

298
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,179
did environment this dedicated user with
limited privileges and so on

299
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,200
we will you did is new

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,420
website a new subdomain that is
basically the supplemented

301
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,730
I shown you a before okay

302
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,250
who is in charge of this interjected the
so-called Coliseum primer

303
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,500
okay the you didn't hear in the room
know that

304
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,309
0 in so we don't agree to have already
practiced on the Coliseum

305
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,240
that visit the Coliseum framework that
behind a hackneyed

306
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,380
Mangino Acme is responsible for creating
all December and the

307
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,770
three different layers okay so the
question pay more but it works like this

308
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,610
you've given

309
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,040
I wanna pick Asian I you set up the
privileges for these web application and

310
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,620
you will

311
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,330
come out without and looks okay with a
new subdomain it's a framework

312
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,120
white the framework a framework because
can it can be expended

313
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,410
support deeper and I'll practices

314
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,700
then different web server different
languages

315
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,280
okay in order to be multi-platform

316
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,380
is hour ago so

317
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,710
we can achieve to create an boxes with
all of these technologies

318
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,950
each technology require a tough
challenge a technical challenge to

319
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,330
isolated on all of this technology is
because

320
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,630
a party hard its own rules salinas it.

321
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,800
rule Windows same I A S same

322
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,639
so a we can support me from the web
programming languages

323
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,130
different databases Michael to people
sever my people

324
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,320
whatever post-grant I'll presidencies
them

325
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,780
what do we support now right now we
support

326
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,150
this back I 87 PHP makes people

327
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,590
yaaa I'm sure the officers carry with me

328
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,840
screamin I because Windows allow that

329
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,020
I'll our to immediately support number

330
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,990
all upper layer languages for example
PHP botnet

331
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,030
fair all at once okay

332
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,400
so we decided to use Windows in the
beginning and then it could

333
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,630
expand alina and all the others so would
be

334
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,330
I you have any PHP application you can
already

335
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,830
create your cock me and use them I
showing you

336
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,210
here on that on the preview them also
now

337
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,790
you never created your your hack me FSR
community are you

338
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:07,790
can create your hack K the Billy Graham
registered in Acme

339
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,310
I'm a user I we're going for my area

340
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,530
year it

341
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,580
there's a developer

342
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,750
area your own pub okay the developer

343
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,409
area is where I i fine to kind of
information the first the work in

344
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:30,020
progress

345
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,169
arm Acme

346
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:36,650
basically designed to happen is that I
am creating but still not finished

347
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,030
okay and the completed one so

348
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,030
this is the op de Kock me that they have
run before in the preview them

349
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,370
what I want to show you now is how you
can create a new factory

350
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,400
so this is gonna bring us to their

351
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,020
weeds are will create a new Hockney

352
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,820
a very pretty information at Hackney
requires is the name of the hack me so I

353
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,159
prepared I'm

354
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:06,159
I an application today that is our quote
of the day

355
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,919
they here is the place where I include
description and a description

356
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,409
they should be helpful for the user who
runs this application then we can decide

357
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,440
for the category

358
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,630
this case it the most work

359
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,890
or the pact okay if it's related to a
single injection

360
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,169
in political injection our access that

361
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:38,169
and so on okay recreated

362
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,940
day need arrow the Big Green arrow
appear

363
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,010
it is gonna guide me through out there
with our

364
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,400
okay the way that is just force that
when I King

365
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,600
with I can create the I you hack me

366
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,860
it two ways to create a hotbed again
either

367
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,820
create piles from within the interface
great fights write my own called within

368
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,160
the interface or I can

369
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,290
upload fire okay for example I already
have an application

370
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,640
on my laptop alrighty download an
application

371
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,530
save the file to my on laptop my own
computer

372
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,320
and they can upload this fight or
important our key with the ball

373
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,890
a very quickly I will show you how you
can create

374
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,040
a new file for example past about PHP

375
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,720
year you will find that the PSP

376
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,200
okay I can

377
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,420
I jumpin' and I will find what we call

378
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,630
called me or call me or is a place where
you have

379
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,990
syntax highlight I like that and I so
want to hear you can ride

380
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:55,990
medically I your PHP called okay

381
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:04,270
work with that whatever you want but you
could

382
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,470
okay 7 call us when you're done

383
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,830
right in your own your own call and it
will be

384
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,960
up by the way up will appear in the in
the in the sandbox okay

385
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,230
from the final user or anything we can
just important Arqiva

386
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,160
you advise the file with all the parts
of the application you can just use this

387
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,440
for example a than me use

388
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,530
what have created here quotations

389
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,230
not rar okay I'm going to upload it

390
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,780
and all the parts contain in today
arcade

391
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,990
are here okay that is not on review
application this is obligated to

392
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,140
convince a month so

393
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,760
alderson higher so I mean it's a good
example if we going to

394
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,680
we I mean paul that we can both the
folder so

395
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,360
quite a good amount though while yeah I
want to show you something

396
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,530
I of course even one

397
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,250
want apple pie second modify this file
this is the file

398
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,180
it contains the connection between the
web application that automates

399
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,130
okay where we make the connection
between the two so it contain

400
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,580
and other big-name the user name and the
password with which we will want to

401
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,840
connect to the database

402
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,020
right I will have to keep that in mind
once a week ago

403
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,250
of computer data bases with in Hackney
so we go back

404
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,860
we are done with the fight them for
their nothing now to create

405
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,480
than expected the privileges okay

406
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,190
every web application of privileges
every folder for example watercress

407
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,340
temporary folder t want it to be
writeable so that people can

408
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,960
upload file in a very easy way i can.

409
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,530
about the did privileges for the images
folder make it writeable

410
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,810
okay is an obstruction what you would do

411
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,590
on their pregnancies and when you
configure all

412
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,920
yar your what the environment right so
the next

413
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,370
that be the server this is an
obstruction on this server configuration

414
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:17,150
a 13 support more people are you with
him or feature here are more web server

415
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,110
medically would be able to decide on
which web server you want this

416
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,480
application to run

417
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,640
you want to run to be run on Linux if
you wanna

418
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,100
to be run on Windows right now and they
said we support

419
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,080
I a at seven and you only find I 7 the
index page is basically they did the

420
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
fourth page

421
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,240
that I'll once we type that on my name
will be

422
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,710
run okay so it's the puppy before this
case ready to use PHP

423
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,420
yet this application is in PHP so I will
have to and support

424
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,180
for up USB okay I will not be

425
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:56,590
be once again ones we will support new
languages

426
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,020
you will find fine on both net on are
and so on

427
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,250
for the one who are a

428
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,560
familiar with the psp2 I and I'm this is
basically that dynamic libraries

429
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,270
I that are found in that case be that I
and II

430
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,000
and we can enable up you love them
according to the users within the code

431
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,050
a example we use my people

432
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,730
right to use the database so we will
have to enable this to library here

433
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,700
so that we can make the connection to
the database

434
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,430
many questions before everything's grier

435
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:39,390
okay so this is good

436
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,500
the most interesting part database okay
I this is the place where I have to

437
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,980
conquer your database

438
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,140
arm

439
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,480
and so yes I want to use another base
and here

440
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,660
I can select which kind of database I
wanna yes

441
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,750
and its multi-platform in the future we
hope to

442
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,300
to show you here microsoft people sever
for example our progress okay

443
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,060
up you remember we want to use another
may

444
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,530
and within the cold we find another base
what another big name was quotation

445
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,130
so this is the place where I have been
started information so here I will have

446
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,780
to type

447
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,330
quotations why I have to type it here so
that the Coliseum framework knows

448
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,310
had eat will have to create not obey

449
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,890
in my people with this name okay to
connect it to that

450
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:34,350
web application just the name is not
enough because we have to create this

451
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,350
keen on the database

452
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,800
right so we have to import this

453
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,440
he now of the up that not only have two
options here

454
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,500
medically I can either on I N

455
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,500
version of PHP my admin which is
provided by PHP Miami not mad okay

456
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,390
not provided by our so I can it's
probably pretty I can log in and create

457
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,690
my I

458
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,330
my database my schema I can configure it
with this you have me

459
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,400
from amazing here

460
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,430
can create for example the corporation

461
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,840
okay everyone can use this perfectly

462
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,470
he said the lebanese on your own machine
you can use this

463
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,920
I'll it provided here

464
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,080
so question is quotation

465
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,800
is to learn about me so you can create
the table may come Tom

466
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,260
an important into pocket okay in this
case they already

467
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,910
I already have a people called okay
already

468
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,120
owner Obama databases email database so
I can just click on Insert people called

469
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,580
in this is the place where I have to
cope in pay

470
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,700
the people called okay this he will call
is

471
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,220
here here

472
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:03,520
see how are you and

473
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,700
okay this is it basically we should open
with

474
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,780
some other edit or you

475
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:16,780
thing

476
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,900
so me Corp everything

477
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,750
hopi and paste it here

478
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:31,750
okay here we go did the DOM on the
database

479
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,610
with that I would schema with everything
okay did

480
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,590
has been taken by get to be my i mean as
well so

481
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,670
here you up everything we we we will use
their quotation

482
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,210
database we will create the table we
will

483
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,390
insert meta and so on and we're prepared
to them right

484
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:57,390
so I'm okay 7 close this can I want to
use luck good things is

485
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,750
with what kinda views are name I wanna

486
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,730
log into the database and what kind of
religious

487
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,770
I want to get to the user this is the
same that

488
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,410
you you follow a might people when you
have to create

489
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,799
up and your account and you gotta be so

490
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:20,400
we will use my user and

491
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,230
my past he remembered the

492
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,600
I found this user name and password
within the code okay

493
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,590
so here I have to provide the exact same
information

494
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,620
the people his way and in the privileges
wanted to give this

495
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,890
this kind of pressure because sometimes
you want to create to you wanna

496
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,440
segment the access to the database with
different user

497
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,549
for example a read-only user or another
user with the

498
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:50,690
more privileges so with this you can
decide

499
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,270
which kind of religious my user that I
have

500
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,679
created here %ah on this database

501
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,720
the quotation sotheby's so I will click
on this in

502
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,720
and I will find a few basic

503
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,000
opry manages at a concert update for us
it's okay to be whole

504
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,549
for demo

505
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:18,880
that pretty much cheaper than other me

506
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,429
of

507
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:30,510
I expect the same thing once they finish
manner but it has the overview of our

508
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,840
application

509
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,350
so at basically what we have done so far

510
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,679
in about what religious we have

511
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:43,160
that up right the images folder the web
server

512
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,990
on me enabled libraries that we have
done

513
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,600
I think that is a nombre via what we
have done so far

514
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,880
so what I can do now is finally showed
the preview

515
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,120
okay I'm I N

516
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,390
show me the preview okay American now we
are creating up then broke out to a bar

517
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,330
where fire

518
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,280
automated sendo in

519
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,049
it is the work on the quality on prime
so we are creating this handbook for the

520
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:15,270
first time

521
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,900
on the few seconds you can imagine how
many things are going on right now

522
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,140
and hopefully I love them are going well

523
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,210
I'm

524
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,230
okay good so this is our application

525
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,690
very simple all the really thin

526
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,900
the show that medically our database was
correctly

527
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,260
picked up by the call him framework I
can search for love here

528
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,150
marking

529
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,570
and I'm medically there's been another
mistake

530
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,179
created a new web application you 1 I'm
aware application

531
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,580
I can go in the quote of the day which
is probably the most amusing thing on

532
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,770
the entire presentation

533
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,289
and I can do basically whatever I one
with this

534
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:08,379
a with it now with the publication
sequel injection

535
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,859
across its Great Dane a if you go back
here

536
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:19,859
for example not anymore that that people
injection I can have some fun

537
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,530
self-medicate created a ball novel
application

538
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,109
in 10 minutes of course had everything
prepared for the database

539
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:30,330
but exporting from between my admin is
not

540
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,080
a big deal anyway so we have completed
the process

541
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,389
now we r we are given with two different
option they've been published or

542
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,379
David drop if you're not completely done

543
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:45,740
with our creation we can say because I'm
drop okay

544
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,409
and may be completed later in this case
we are done so we can do

545
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,100
save and publish and I can have two
options here very interesting

546
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,029
because if you don't want to share this
with others

547
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,990
you wanna keep the private only for you
can do it only me

548
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,390
is that it had been eating on this is
for example in case you wanna

549
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,820
do your super-secret research

550
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,820
on your super-secret formal application
you up on something

551
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,300
incredible you're the one I share it
with others you can do it your login on

552
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,589
your

553
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:21,810
will be able to have to see this your
wife we advise you to

554
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,339
to use the public that main park was on
the project

555
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:29,130
so you can make it public click on OK
proceed

556
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,520
not now you should do it

557
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,780
a and here you will find medically that
the permalink in the sharply in forty

558
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,010
I'll what one on one occasion

559
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,600
okay to shortly it short because the
domain is short

560
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,220
also very expensive a but the permalink
it but he could be home page

561
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,470
for them vulnerable web web application
you can use it in your own

562
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,000
are your own blog for example you make a
blog post about something

563
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,820
about the vulnerability you can quickly
create

564
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,710
an example I use case with impact me and
share

565
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,940
something practical in your own blog
post in your own

566
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,300
articles in your own presentation for
example we have professor

567
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,619
use this within their club this
universities or even researchers would

568
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:23,080
you know instead of putting their their
environment on a laptop when they do

569
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,180
presentation they just created

570
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,160
before and then started on the fly and
they can have

571
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,900
the entire audiences thought the same
application on the flight

572
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,190
because if they have a laptop they can
just go to

573
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:42,100
I got me a use in the sharply and they
will do it in the at the same time the

574
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,759
same thing that the Pretender with 21

575
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,260
page right so OK

576
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,859
I have published my laptop grid

577
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:58,490
so now my a my quota for the day hope
yours here

578
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,740
okay it public

579
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,900
I can started whenever i won everyone
can start because it public

580
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,950
you for one of the week it week

581
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,290
we can money but I am I can just click
on freak

582
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:20,220
okay I am for example I wanna add more
features

583
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,650
I want to change the visibility mom of
course

584
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,700
defying do this it would be put on mine
pain and small

585
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,910
so no one else can run this application
why I modified

586
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:36,790
okay

587
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,680
so we I'm back in today I into the
wizard

588
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,710
I can go here and maybe do on me okay

589
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,200
or you can just go on I modifying
compile them folder

590
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,210
medically I will resume my

591
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,320
Empire a application so this is a a

592
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,359
all for them in that one with the
presentation

593
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,450
yet from like that so what we want to do
next

594
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,600
okay future development they said we
want to expend the pot for for more

595
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,140
languages more than a basis

596
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,970
more web server so make any actually
multi-platform

597
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,550
so that you can decide the thing called
where

598
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,960
it should be run okay

599
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,220
we want to remain in an the the Hackney
creation experience so they interpreted

600
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,560
that we have done now

601
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,500
weekend make it better because we
understand it the better it is

602
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,420
mr Hockey we will have on the platform
the more successful the project is

603
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,470
so that they won the things we want to
do what you can do

604
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,200
without them for us you can hear another
developer books and the

605
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,720
him framework are you can be a sponsor

606
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,410
company i'm joined the Parsis

607
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,550
to to expand and they said you can be a
hug me create or if you wanna do you

608
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,109
follow if you wanna be a developer wanna
help us

609
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:02,119
good extend the canadian Prime work I
you'll get a lot of things

610
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,010
first a lot a lot of pain which by the
way mean

611
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,540
Hungarian Italian should tell you how
much we pay the volunteer their will

612
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,690
that will work on that but anyway it's a
free project

613
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,359
I'll but definitely I think with this
project is cool

614
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,960
and had quite a lot many people around
the world learning with application

615
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,420
security practice and with a petition
security so

616
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,900
before we finish I'm iPod got to

617
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,140
to the hockey team was work hard for the
past 30 months

618
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,570
I just have to talk to them in a while
and the who are here

in

648
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,500

symbol

649
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,870
that they could Napoli

650

whether them books that was born and

651
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,400
right for that to avoid the shared
environment so the

652
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,630
10 boxes only for you no one out again
even if they know the league

653
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,450
okay if hide only to your PC to your IP
address

654
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,650
and to your PC so are you can and heard
a sandbox

655
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,210
okay so on you can modify that then look
no one out

656
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:24,890
can put any malware on it that's white
9min

657
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,640
net the the second part did the 99
percent

658
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,890

659
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,910
upload a mellower as a hot me we have a
moderation on the hotness so we actually

660
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,980
go through

661
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,260
a each and every a new hot me that's
been posted on Hackney

662
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,040
to make sure that this is not a place
you know for drive-by Mauer and

663
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,360
up like that so definitely nothin

664
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,780
reason

665
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,430
how so the question is how long will the
hotness a on our website

666

medical how long you want to win will

so no limitation no night exploration
method

671
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,710
