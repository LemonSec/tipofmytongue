32 the one-liner this the one mind

184
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,980
a box and composer created a dance
production

185
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,440

191
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,470
Cup quiet perspire it up it's not every
day you see a dancer

192
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,970
illustrating the formation of a botnet
or the damage done by

193
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,670
you got attacked with the fluorescent
modern dance movements

194
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,300
the frenetic down to the electroacoustic
be in a classical

195
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,040
musical ensemble yet that's precisely
what a box and composer and New York

196
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,070
choreographer have done to tell the
story with subversive

197
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,960
online community and not a minute the

201
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,360
I was wanting it that believed to have
their

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,250
putting is million one is this not on

right next door you can't have your
privacy violated

204
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,940
if you don't know your privacy is
violated said US Congress in

205
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,940
Mike Rogers thread say that again who
can you can't have your privacy violated

206
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,960
if you don't know your privacy is
violated

207
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,680
US Congressman Mike Rogers and good

208
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,990
all it go fall fund

209
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,480
I that's going to help you

210
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,400
it is through added I just go to read
the full quote

211
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,730
you can't have your privacy violated if
you don't know your privacy is violated

212
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,670
rate maybe the fact that we haven't had
any complaints come forward

213
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,940
with any specific just busy arguing that
the privacy has been violated

214
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,240
clearly indicate in 10 years and clearly
indicate that somebody must be doing

215
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,180
something exactly right

216
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,960
it through the congress on word-for-word
does a direct quote from a congressman

217
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,339
got one for bed went

218
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,710
that's why would cavalry the other go
ahead goofball

219
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,010
the NSA insist that transparency hurt

220
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,260
Americans privacy because day the NSA

221
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:02,260
are looking at it anyway and you can
read it again air-ground

222
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,390
yeah that too is this true the road yes
there is through

223
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,210
Robert litt the general counsel for the
OPP to the Director of National

224
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,200
Intelligence

225
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
said that it would have a privacy
diminishing a fact

226
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,470
it tells its official report review
every piece of data vacuumed up 100

227
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,750
Internet and phone surveillance programs

228
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,230
attempting to make this determination
would require the intelligence community

229
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,310
to research and review personally
identifying information

230
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,630
solely for the purpose of complying with
the reporting requirement

231
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,529
even if the information has not been
determined to contain for intelligence

232
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,950
they argued such an effort would
complete without efforts to protect

233
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,110
privacy

234
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,279
bit while addressing the panel added
that such a requirement would

235
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,380
perversely undermine privacy in

236
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,570
it's just said some of it is

237
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,220

00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,870
in red

468
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,130
you like my gramma a good

469
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:49,270
on Monday good hackers claim they used a
zero-day vulnerability to Brea debris to

470
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,970
what

471
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,040
support forum software and

472
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,480
the software itself not the Paul
vBulletin 4.0 on

473
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,960
good a group of hackers claimed to have
exported and undocumented vulnerability

474
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,659
in the BU

475
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,169
both the internet for in order to break
into the next question

476
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:12,050
okay using the term your day and

477
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,240
number three red be estimated

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,600
860,000 users when

479
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,020
you got it on the Mac rumors were you
think people would

480
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,820
it so the 800 and I think 2000 users lol
had to change their passwords

481
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,520
immediately after hackers hackers got
into you get the point Madrid

482
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,149
art just a lotta ok red

483
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:43,110

up the dividend what counts he said was

490
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,940
the difference with the totalitarian
state is that the citizens couldn't do

491
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,850
anything about it

492
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,520
if we don't expose there the security in
a separate parts that are

493
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,940
are valid for the past parts that are
not valid there were complicit

494
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,490
were complicit with what's going on we

00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,339
NSA and and the Department of Homeland
Security have

threatened legal action to block this
saleable what

598
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:30,880
that ridicules these two powerful
government agencies

599
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,569
and

600
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:39,950
government is trying to block this
aiello

601
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,250
what that criticizes yet

602
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,880
risky move well hope that the risk blew
it

603
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,540
a teacher picked poet right clear

604
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,319

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:06,250
good when

608
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,690
alright is the true story that is
absolutely a true story

609
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,850
period remember the old crypto

610
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,770
your sister is a mission from the 90's
thinking

611
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,750
alright so what's the final score

612
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,960
good I have

613
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,250
rise reviews every day all day one a

614
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:33,170
Magin that went into it neier not by as
much as they should

615
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,750
actually maybe I used it last night I
was supposed to give these guys a flask

616
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,089
is the winner

617
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:42,910
so I'll get you and olaf stamp lahoo

618
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,520
as that my personal collection very ago
good

619
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,350
so II hope that was fun for you what I
tried to do is

620
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,800
actually show the absurdity of what's
happening right now

621
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,220
that so many things a would appear to be

622
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,020
call from the Prime but it's all
happening right now

623
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,600
and it's something that we all need to
be aware up

624
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,500
and I'll leave it to be 3 to finish up
