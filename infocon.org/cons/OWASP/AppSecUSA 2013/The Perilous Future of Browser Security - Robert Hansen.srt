1
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,080
but I really actually do money people I
think they're for the most part

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,710
very smart

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,880
and actually know what the right thing
to do ask them what to do

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,800
take care easy almost always a good
answer assays

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,189
instinctively get the right they
understand up

6
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,909
what to do so I think alike God and that
it's David Ross

7
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,230
I Katie these people as if you happen to
see him around

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,489
run into him whatever I by a beer Yamaha

9
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,600
since there are some people actually
really like these people I i'm

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,390
I mean I'm actually no disrespect even
though I am constantly bugging them

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,370
I so but I will argue that they cannot

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,710
be successful at doing their job I'm
givin

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,899
with the type to companies that they're
on and ecosystem that we currently work

14
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,820
with them

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,269
so I have to ask the question and I
think you should ask them yourselves

16
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:06,460
like why are you here and I don't mean
like at this particular convention

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,640
necessarily I mean

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,070
in this industry like how did you get
here why are you here I

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,050
are you doing it for fame or money you
know what what what's the reason you're

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,929
doing how you doing it to protect people

21
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:19,330
I so Germany Grossman our city our
company is

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,470
my best friends and I am he and I can
always just wanted to help

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,259
I've specs on the stuff that's we see
broken and I think that sort of drives

24
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,070
us to do certain things and take certain

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,850
up as in life but if you wanna make the
biggest impact on security you really

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,250
have to focus on the biggest hits right
there's nothing the most important

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,360
places you can fix the

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,530
that choke points on the Internet for
things like browsers

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,210
I'll languages operating systems
networks I

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,250
you know mobile devices that those are
the big choke points we got on the

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,360
internet we can fix those things you
literally and then browsers case

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,770
you can actually impact 2.4 billion
people on the planet so I'm not talking

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,689
about small decisions here this is
actually affects every single person

34
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,430
you've ever met

35
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,689
I so here's the scope of the problem so
we have around 2.4 billion people on the

36
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,590
internet right now

37
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,049
that's that's not the entire population
world not by a long shot but its a lot

38
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:09,690
have their earth

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,359
I'm we have about 40

40
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:17,530
as I 84 to 90 percent now a shame these
numbers and how I got them later but I

41
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,250
love the Internet

42
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,910
say that they want privacy so that sa if
you ask missus all selected so this

43
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,780
number is a little

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,419
those cute or whatever but but you can
you can get my get my draft right

45
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,690
oz let's 2.16 billion people

46
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,090
I are so above the 2.4 billion people
who want privacy

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,900
I am within that group there's probably
millions of people that we can directly

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,910
impact in our daily lives that we can

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,299
I reach out to through the press or
whenever we can somehow impact and

50
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,000
change their lives in some ways so

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,350
a smaller percentage you don't know that
number cuz its its

52
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,959
it changes all the time really but but
you get my point and then

53
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,139
if you look at people who actively go no
script is a good example of a technology

54
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,949
a lot of people use to protect
themselves

55
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,030
I as 1.9 million users have no script

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,209
so the actual Scopus changes that we've
been able to affect with the given

57
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,489
technologies is very very small compared
to the size the ecosystem

58
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,459
I'm so we know things like no script do
not work for the ecosystem they were

59
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,229
great for me

60
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,350
agree for the people as audience but
they do not work for our

61
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,530
parents or grandparents I kinda stuff so
others what was really great

62
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,620
I like I said I'd actually like the
people at work these companies are

63
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,820
I somebody's got to actually I nice

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,579
different people want different
experiences are going to choose a

65
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,019
browser based on that preference missus
comes from is a lot I think that's

66
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:36,829
really accurate

67
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,639
and this is sorta a diagram I wrote not
too kinda try to explain to people what

68
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,900
the differences between browsers could
be

69
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,109
so the blue third the dark blue triangle
in the middle

70
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,900
is sort of what your browser as it comes
out in a box this is what it's for a

71
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,259
pre-configured to do it right

72
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,880
on day one you get this the darker blue
birds at librivox:

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,570
are trying a rather is around it is sort
of what you can extend your browser to

74
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,449
be able to do with plugins out on
extensions

75
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,799
job configuration changes network all
this other stuff

76
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,699
in line devices and so on these are all
the other things you can make your

77
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,389
browser do

78
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,799
the yellow train on the bottom is
possibly when a consumer might want

79
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
I they don't really care as much about
the security aspects

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,259
and terms and actually actively doing
anything about it but they

81
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:25,040
really don't go either way to get extra
features they want more

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,150
functionality and they want more
usability as only the same or as deep

83
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,860
a functionality is a guy like me are
people in this room I want you might

84
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,060
want to be able to do all kinda crazy
things bill the chain CSS on the flyer

85
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,370
always kinda crazy extract functionality
I'm sorry usability and does make

86
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,539
easy to use it makes it more functional
and a guy like me obviously was a lot

87
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,400
more security on to my browser far
beyond its normal reach

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840
II wanna certainly turn everything off
that I could turn off but I'll turn off

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,509
almost everything I could turn off how
can I do still want to do some stuff

90
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,960
I am Palace like I messed up as weapons
you convert from

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,460
a Mac to to Windows button so Google all

92
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,349
and their I this is a

93
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,860
this a diagram I love what they're for
the different actors

94
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,469
in the space or want out a the browser
ecosystem

95
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:16,650
so Google primarily wants higher ad
spend that's the

96
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,810
fundamental thing that they want out I
love the

97
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,099
ecosystem they want increase the amount
it adds and increase the value of those

98
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,139
ads

99
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,110
I advertisers they primarily what high
conversion rates lower cost per click

100
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,650
a higher click-through ratios and
ultimately a return on investment

101
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,860
they wanna make money I have no selling
t-shirts or whatever right

102
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,719
so the thing that they share in common
and the thing that they both have in

103
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,469
common is monetizing users

104
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,249
that is that is something that they have
in common it's not something that users

105
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,689
why it's something that those two

106
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,590
those two groups want users if you just
look in his cell slacks

107
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,539
primarily they want privacy and security
in the fundamental lowest thing on the

108
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,210
I would think that they have its
distinctive I have new look at what they

109
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,030
share with advertisers they want quality
products they want better t-shirts they

110
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,620
wants a better clones and whatever right
the things they consume

111
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,120
the things that they share with Google
they they primarily want better search

112
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,789
results

113
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,669
they want to see I you know when the
searching for teachers they won high

114
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,069
polish church officials on top in 10
scam store right

115
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,330
and the only thing that all three groups
have in common is performance

116
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,969
the all want faster performance they
want speed on a browser

117
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,219
that allows you to spend more allows you
to transact more

118
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,240
allows you to see more on the Internet
short amount time and it's less

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,310
exhorted of a user experience so so
different actors

120
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,090
different needs different things they're
trying to get out of this ecosystem mmm

121
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,479
so this is a good example of where I
like people to understand advertisers

122
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,090
and Google are not in lockstep

123
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,349
they actually do have different needs on
this so

124
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:52,259
this is somebody's web sites and as ads
on there and I wanted ads is an ad for

125
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,069
Google

126
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,270
not have signed up and get ads and put
it on your website so

127
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,529
affectively by showing this ad they're
more last telling

128
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:03,479
a user on the site you should get in the
business I love putting up web sites and

129
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,550
putting ads on the internet I which is
through doesn't really help this person

130
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,009
right this person

131
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,990
doesn't necessarily get any benefit in
fact they might actually get less

132
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,219
benefit because you might be interested
the same thing they are

133
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:17,740
you mike in a competing business and
actually rehearsed their market more

134
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,629
last

135
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:21,749
so they're definitely not in lockstep
from

136
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:24,870
from a incentive perspective

137
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,309
so my goal I yours have to start with a
goal I

138
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,309
is to have a more private browser but
basically

139
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:35,620
I want to protect the sensitive
information that on my computer I have a

140
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,120
lot of people

141
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,919
other people secrets about my own
secrets I am and if you say you don't

142
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,759
have secrets

143
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,650
I'm not gonna trust your secrets I so my
personal

144
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,699
path that goal as a little bit different
to most people's I

145
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,849
I everything that I do you have to have
at least

146
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,840
to I answered have been methods are
protecting ourselves because

147
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,389
anyone could theoretically break right
we can define explain want it much

148
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,469
harder to change on abilities together

149
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:06,039
I makes it almost almost impossible not
impossible but nearly impossible

150
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,689
I so lately I ASM just this past snowed
in thing

151
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,539
I've been getting the question why
should you just don't tell people to go

152
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:13,819
visit or browser

153
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,039
I am and the the problem is the grandpa
problem

154
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,659
I am so a while back a couple years ago

155
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:23,770
um there is this problem where I

156
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,620
anonymous effectively I told I the world
that they had uncovered a hundred and

157
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,750
the sea passwords

158
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,750
by I'm having hacks at or accidents

159
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,620
I'm and what's interesting is because
it's exactly 100

160
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,360
it's a hundred mines not ninety-six or
something it's exactly 100 I which means

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,270
we know they have a lot more than that
which means that we know that's

162
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,480
there obviously looking a lot more
traffic than that we know that

163
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,190
people our house packed exit nodes in
section one another the best things

164
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,010
about running an exit known as Wasilla
traffic

165
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,520
I so so grandpa

166
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,260
I he might be interested in protecting
himself so dollars it or browser

167
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,670
I he send sensitive information over
HTTP and HTTPS because he's scrambling

168
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,610
doesn't know the difference between
those two things

169
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,290
and effectively there the exit node
steal that information

170
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,240
and hacks for grandpa and he no longer
has a retirement right so

171
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,270
there's a difference between an ammonium
privacy and it that's a very slight

172
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,480
distinction but I think it's important
to at least be aware at cognizant

173
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,149
up the difference and why you cannot
recommend for two people who don't know

174
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:24,709
security

175
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:28,550
do already very much understand that the
pubs best so what they want to submit a

176
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,620
loan application

177
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,310
you really don't need to be an honest I
can really can't be anonymous you're

178
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,250
trying to say

179
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,750
give me money iight know who once was to
give you money to write Sep by Mert nem

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,970
virtual what you're doing you cannot be
anonymous so there's no point in using

181
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,800
tor browser

182
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,750
but you may want to be pried it you
don't want anyone else to know that you

183
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,279
want this money you maybe you don't want
people to know that you don't have the

184
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,240
money you know i mean

185
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,500
I with your serving for legal

186
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,390
as opposed to illegal up porn for
instance maybe that's something you

187
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,649
up maybe you want a non-entity for that
maybe you do

188
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:02,029
I let's say you're work in the process
something you don't people knowing

189
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,459
you're not gonna person or whatever

190
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,770
waiter a a political person or something
whatever you know you get my

191
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,890
my draft but you probably still want
privacy you don't want your mom to know

192
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,959
what your surfin

193
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,060
in your spare time I if your political
dissident on the other hand you want

194
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,520
both

195
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,420
I you don't want anyone to know what
you're doing you don't want anyone to

196
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,170
know your name

197
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,920
you don't be in your family cannot be
trusted because you're putting them a

198
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,510
arms

199
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,149
in harm's way if they find out right so
that's another good example where it or

200
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,480
brother would actually be a good

201
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,320
a good idea I and then get things like
me research research in pressure cookers

202
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,770
because apparently that's not a bad
thing to do I so I may 1 anonymity I

203
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,079
don't want anyone to know that I'm
researching pressure cookers because

204
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,880
they were just ask too many questions
and I don't want to deal with the hassle

205
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,560
I really care about privacy is my wife
find other am searching for pressure

206
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,050
cookers

207
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,310
who gives a crap right she knows that I
just wanna crockpot i'ma

208
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,360
and I do my part but so this

209
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,670
this is what an average website looks
like today I

210
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,949
aligning a lotta people think other
web-site is very two-dimensional things

211
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,140
they are definitely not the browser the
DOM

212
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,230
and his very three dimensional town is
the access

213
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,360
absentia transparency steps you can
actually see through the DOM and

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,829
actually look at multiple layers

215
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,050
on one other thing that was actually my
health card I got actually bothered to

216
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,970
look for the source code

217
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,649
a huge mistake in Adana I but said I

218
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,320
but it has all these problems it's it's
a it's very three dimensional on there's

219
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,140
no way for you to actually know what's
going on any given time without actually

220
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,190
looking at what the DOM is doing in that
moment

221
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,339
and sourcing too much JavaScript there's
no way for you to know exactly what's

222
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:29,860
happening

223
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,959
in a time to check how to use issue it's
it's just a total tear down

224
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,560
but every site is like that it's not
health care not comment every site

225
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,640
I every Mon site has this exact same
sort of way out

226
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
so what am i willing to give up I

227
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,320
if I'm gonna make a secure browser what
I have to do to get there and I i have

228
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,250
done this

229
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,360
know it's is a major pain the butt I so
firstly I don't need anything to be fast

230
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,690
%ah so unlike the normal consumer who is
focused on spin performance

231
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,230
idoney that I don't care about it said
in fact I think speak can actually kill

232
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,850
you in a lot of cases has lot of things
that

233
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,430
in writing JavaScript fast they can
generate yeah the best to get hacked

234
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,370
I idoney bookmarks autofill prefetching
web slice gallery

235
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,120
whatever the hell that is and a bunch of
other stuff prime going to get rid of

236
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,079
all that stuff it's all pointless from
my perspective

237
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,910
I don't need any whiz-bang web sites no
fly and their whatever transitions and

238
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,110
stuff ammonia and all that stuff I'm I'm
really not extend that doesn't action

239
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,790
him help me on the internet do what my I
need to do and I'd really don't care

240
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,279
about pop ups are warnings

241
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,420
unless they're actually help for nothing
actually a warm me up impending

242
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,010
you reversible danger and they don't
warn me about that they're pointless and

243
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,959
they're just get my way

244
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,140
I so in Explorer has amazingly stupid
pop up if you're trying to dinner

245
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,699
make scripts run optionally it's like
scripts are usually and save you one

246
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:43,350
allow scripts

247
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,980
which script what you talking about ISO
usual stuff like that

248
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,589
so there's a lot of enemies if your
gonna bill that you gotta focus on what

249
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:52,990
the problem space are so here's the
props right

250
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,860
first thing crossed into anything cross
domain is a potential way you can get

251
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,390
hacked

252
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,670
I don't massaging IMO JavaScript appoint
an iframe or

253
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,870
or making a across from an request they
can do our house arrest forty percent

254
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,779
scraping by tracking and so on right

255
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,620
I so there's a much different ways it's
all that our request policies problem my

256
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,970
favorite bob ricks all across the main
requests

257
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,150
I'm there are some caveats that are some
ways to hack it but for the most part

258
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,350
it's very good

259
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,120
I if you've never used it it's sort of
like 10 i no script on crack

260
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,189
it's just way way worse than 30 minute
breaks is pretty amazing

261
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:27,199
i no script hi is good for iframes it
doesn't really help with that much

262
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:30,260
crossed man stuck with exceptional aid
application on reinforcement which is

263
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,540
very very good

264
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,010
and stopped all local arts 1918 request
leaving behind a probar y will be

265
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,809
protected

266
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:38,990
you can actually be configured as a I
don't want to be able to source in my

267
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,720
bank

268
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,870
from any other website other than when I
just type it and I mean

269
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,860
I poor blocking this is something you
typically do the firewall level you can

270
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,689
do it local

271
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,150
has base firewalls we can do and
network-based this can actually prevent

272
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,860
a lot of the

273
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,800
attacks with you can say I only in a
tunnel at the internet don't allow my

274
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,939
browser instance

275
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:59,550
are from when this VM for instance the
contact anything outlook Larson 1918 or

276
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,770
or whenever he is happy sex web

277
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,779
I living credentials upon logged out is
actually very helpful because it

278
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,410
it limits what cross a request for you
can do because you're you're not logged

279
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,260
in overtime right and so it that if i'm
wrong. out very frequently it's very

280
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,610
less likely option is the drive my stuff
is going to be able to impact aside time

281
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,449
are going to

282
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,449
since I don't have my cookies anymore so
that's nice Facebook rise in DNS where

283
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:23,620
applicable there someplace that doesn't
make sense

284
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,699
but typically you should not allow the
internet to see what your

285
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,029
your DNS looks like internally and vice
versa this them almost everybody gets a

286
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:30,819
strong

287
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,449
almost everyone host DNS on the same
service do so a

288
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:38,490
that's bad for all countries and by the
way had so pac-man execution

289
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,670
I am it's pretty obvious I don't want
people running stuff on my computer

290
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,980
right this typically we think I was an
hour I so

291
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,260
no script and put Java others are both
great plugins

292
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,029
day limit what you can do in JavaScript
space I that's great you are actually

293
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,279
turn on when you want it

294
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,600
that's right that's right really helpful
are moving protocol handlers

295
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,390
on the whole mess liberal handlers that
do all kinds a random things

296
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,439
that actually one of the main factors
that one hour gets and

297
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,750
I so you just need to train them to
always ask have do you sure you want to

298
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,319
run like it. mass protocol from your
website like

299
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,480
I probably don't need to watch iTunes
from my website

300
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,930
I released it let me know and I'll make
the decision

301
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,390
output to play is actually probably one
of the most useful features

302
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,959
if used properly I it basically will say
you don't run Java

303
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,620
or you don't run ActiveX controls are
you don't try and whatever we're talking

304
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,400
about

305
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,040
flash whatever unless you click this
button say yes I do want to allow it

306
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,740
I so that limits optimistic drive-by
pretty substantially

307
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,600
I Sandboxie I don't a few has a minor
Sam Barclay

308
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,600
as prequel to I have heard urged upon
checking out on Windows it's similar in

309
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,730
30 ish dear

310
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,420
sandbox and ash exact were joking after
someone if you're familiar with those

311
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,410
things

312
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,439
a Windows seven is great thing is:
learned that as so it actually prevent

313
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,569
prevent a lot of that sort memnoch
russian issues figuring out where stuff

314
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:58,339
is in 20 pointers of along with haitians
Alonso

315
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,059
go on Microsoft that was great they
really improve up their game in 107 her

316
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,949
for over a previous versions

317
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:07,490
I went to his crop don't even I be if
the

318
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,829
archery jails if you're not familiar
with this it's very similar Sandboxie

319
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:12,390
except the much lower level

320
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,800
there's only been one explain it in the
history of the product and it's been out

321
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,730
there for by 10 years or something so
very very solid

322
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,470
I a similar again to say market exactly
and Joe can't

323
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,510
for from over those things anti-virus I
a lot of people laugh about anti-virus

324
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,189
actually think ambers does have a time
and place if you have an extra CPU and

325
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,630
you don't really care about wasting your
own power

326
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,790
I by their is certain circumstances were
anti virus has car buyers is so you will

327
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,050
get some incremental gain from doing
that

328
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,740
ideally are some or something it hit a
half times are familiar with that or

329
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,680
are trip wires commercial product i
anybody is modifying binaries that would

330
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,770
be a good thing to know

331
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,949
obviously from our finger binaries
without you knowing it that's probably

332
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,079
something bad

333
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,919
I application whitelisting content agree
monitoring as a whole bunch products out

334
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,270
there to do this kinda stuff

335
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,949
Court races wanna bigger ones I actually
think we just got bob

336
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:04,839
time to mention I think about them up in
a way that kinda thing figuring out

337
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,990
I only one run the certain binaries are
from the browser process

338
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,900
so this is what that ends up looking
like I so

339
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,809
on the outside you have PF packet filter
inside that mean for the st. thats

340
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,699
routing the st. Jude retreats jails

341
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,679
inside that your you're launching
VirtualBox inside that you have multiple

342
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,959
and different affectively jails I

343
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,380
those I can be remember your male
friends 10c outlook access our

344
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,690
whenever hi and you have your browser
have those are windows 7 images

345
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,880
insiders 127 images yet Sandboxie inside
Sandboxie you

346
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,230
you have a stripped down version of
Firefox and there you go

347
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,679
right no memory corruption you have to
jump in so many hopes to get out into

348
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,919
the pan operating system

349
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,549
or into even even into one and the
subsequent a nearby jails

350
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,570
makes it nearly impossible so data
exfiltration in the next one

351
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,210
idea frustrations really gnarly I could
he'd take stuff out of my computer still

352
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,700
suffer me that would be bad

353
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,710
so I one thing that everyone gets wrong
as the same wing Aaron transparency

354
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,179
taking screenshots and you can still see
what's going on behind their

355
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,120
this transparency going on as his all
the time I remain credentials upon

356
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,070
lockouts

357
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,230
disabling an efficient at an hour
support which sounds like a bad thing

358
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,360
from a prick from the previous slide but
the there's reasons et phone home

359
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,250
I every couple hours if on time
depending on which browser using Firefox

360
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,360
an Internet and I and chrome from also
sent a machine ID and he's riding the

361
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,059
internet every five hours

362
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,660
I request policy i think is much better
than our block

363
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,140
for the purpose of protecting your
privacy and and really improving when is

364
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,950
actual traded out to third parties

365
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,120
I but I think both eg provide some value
I

366
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,360
settings require planning permission so
this is similar to us talking about with

367
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,750
operable handlers

368
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,660
I just make sure that everything's
always click to I to lurch you

369
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,799
I rip burp suite I pas Wireshark in
Process Explorer alt

370
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,049
show what's going on is a subset making
up our connections

371
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,549
I am I there's a there's a tool

372
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:05,039
I I what they called I Little Snitch and
Mac it for free without

373
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,000
for someone that not Firefox as a great
bill to enact

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,220
a our lack access to raise corn and
Falco answer SMB protocol is removed

375
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,820
which is great I they do you have things
like

376
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,320
chrome calling in about home one not
gonna stop which is not as good and I

377
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,169
wish they didn't but

378
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,740
they do so I so it the more you can read
that better

379
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,960
bold images upon reboot make sure that
nothing process so cookies and a Flash

380
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,320
cookies and all the other I

381
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,880
persistence items Aldous get removed
upon reboot

382
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,090
and in Firefox also just recently fest
affects the CSS history how can I think

383
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,260
they also affect that pixel perfect
timing tak

384
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,510
I just like last month so man the middle

385
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,059
I as a pretty common what I think we're
all familiar with this one I

386
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,510
and Charles CA and cities in Verisign
gold images to remove temporary allowed

387
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,480
certs

388
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,410
I it be if you have reimburse we can you
have to a temporally allow certain

389
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,030
you don't obviously want to keep that up
for ever I stand alone proxy support for

390
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,610
Firefox with this can actually hurt you
and help you depending on how you use it

391
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,260
if used properly it can help you to use
improperly and a surf the internet

392
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,650
wildly from a computer and don't
willy-nilly and just use proxies

393
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,049
this will get you killed because at all
phone home through

394
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,299
and they had smashed for calls outside
the proxy and so that's

395
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,039
not I butts but he's a properly and you
limit your computer only making calls

396
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,730
out throughout or friends since he's
been ghastly amor something like that

397
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,270
I you you can actually become very
secure as a staging bpm tunnels

398
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,470
preferably like I said everything has a
backup C is both at once

399
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,950
there have been many issues an SSL over
the years allow

400
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,280
I'll information leakage but there has
been no issues in both at once

401
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,460
I perspectives are as a cell all this I
like the concept that these tools and

402
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,059
practice their action a very good

403
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,240
I i'm not going to all wrist watch my
talk about later meant I meant

404
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,419
as a weird number proxy for proxy I
actually creates more problems in some

405
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,950
ways minute and helps

406
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,950
are you get a chain Firefox with per
proxy through local SSH tunnel actually

407
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,650
reduce

408
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,900
about the bad things a per box but he
could theoretically be doing

409
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,210
I'm not war and I use a VPN

410
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,770
and and like I said rap against p.m. and
make sure that everything's going out

411
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,860
out the same I the same tunnel directly

412
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,360
so if you're not familiar they're
actually are tools right now to doom

413
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,650
animal attacks are using as a cell which
is why should not be using a soldier

414
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,919
primary means a protection

415
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,169
I it's just doesn't work very well and
you have to like this

416
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,360
from packet forensics where you upload
the SSL certs for

417
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,500
you know their sin or whatever the route
certain that this thing and

418
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,210
I basically they they command a middle
any connection I does matter when using

419
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,250
a saw not

420
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,710
and they wouldn't know this if they
weren't using about what's up there

421
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,450
they're doing well I so texting in
pre-filled and protecting and fishing

422
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,990
are are

423
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,289
a common oddball but people care about
this a lot so it's we're talking about

424
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,419
the really are no good solutions new
stuff like Open DNS if you trust them

425
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,419
I kinda don't but had a lot of people
really like them

426
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,880
and newspapers a puzzle quest: policy
into the name on the

427
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,000
to disable javascript I because there
are some situations were superb a

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,140
scenarios where points are singing
JavaScript

429
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,340
on the target so on eBay for instance a
source in JavaScript remote page

430
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,360
it'll look like sign in page but won't
be as so

431
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,039
that's that's not really a not really
great solution but it does fixer

432
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,490
prohibits naras

433
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,610
and then my case education I these I'm
observe a lifetime member a BBW GIs were

434
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,330
for eBay and I fishing team

435
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,929
I just looked at literally thousands
efficient its I

436
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,940
I really don't actually need to worry
about phishing sites

437
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,210
personally this is as offers alright I

438
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,110
and I don't use patterns res conference
so it's not really helpful for people to

439
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,770
get my past her cousin they can't use it
anywhere else so

440
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,929
I so I I haven't totally solve this
problem but it's mostly solved because

441
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:50,860
I'm hymie

442
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,919
I'm some I as a good on the eyeglass

443
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,130
that so this is sort of what it looks
like I'm no scripts

444
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,419
for a cross-site scripting a quick
jacking application by reports much as

445
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:01,890
great party proxy

446
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,440
for the stand on fire RI party support
which is great

447
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,289
request policy as a super awesome for us
to request forgery issues

448
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,530
has the there some issues there but not
a bad

449
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,100
attacking some process scripting is as
the pics as well

450
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,590
with Java for redundancy with I with no
script

451
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,490
I actually really like that to a lot I
and II an actual don't download it

452
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,950
nearly as often as I should amish

453
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,799
machine and I don't think you really
shouldn't special attention to

454
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,570
perspectives

455
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,880
because like I said it doesn't work for
the reasons I haven't told you

456
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,960
I butts so that that's the score church

457
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,340
approach to browser security if you want
to be really secure

458
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,130
that your browser would look like out
what does it look like to actually surf

459
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,520
the internet

460
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,930
that is with CNN looks like my brother

461
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,470
a

462
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,410
I am so

463
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,960
an awesome people like molasses is lax
right I

464
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,280
and they are the problem with links and
as a buffer overflow in mind so

465
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,120
I ever be even if there was I could
happen and put inside say when put on

466
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,070
site in a sandbox Ian nah nah nah right
I could be on the same things but

467
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,970
I but the problem is I still want to be
able to enable things when I need to

468
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,210
enable them and I can't do that Mike
Swenson have

469
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,690
all the functionality so I need greater
functionality than

470
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,400
alikes could possibly perform a number
that triangle fact on

471
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,040
so let's shift focus a little bit
towards outside I

472
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,670
I know that that doesn't sound like it's
related but but it's very very very

473
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,900
related to this problem

474
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,020
so I ve ever seen an yeah

475
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,900
this is apparently what what it's like
to stay I don't I'll never see these

476
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,830
them but I

477
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,040
their parents what people have to deal
with it they go to Baltimore Sun I'm

478
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,100
so this is the first ad that ever
existed

479
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,830
this is from AT&T I'm in the early
eighties this is what started all

480
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm I thought the square was really
interesting this come from cancer found

481
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,390
on the internet I am NOT al gore

482
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,340
I he now wants a new lawyer said we
couldn't runner systems and everything

483
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,030
in it were per-

484
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,420
at 150 because then we wouldn't know
which has to show you so this is a

485
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,090
system that was designed around a
particular business model

486
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,390
so I with the should has a dot dot dot
because we want to track your

487
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,660
right and that's that's what that's the
punchline to that quote

488
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,900
anecdotal tacky to quote someone you
work with but I thought there's a really

489
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,800
great the juror said

490
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,210
you get the smartest people in the world
together the best people this industry

491
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,640
has to offer for the sole purpose and
serving up ads

492
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,470
right and so we're we we have this out
his mom with Google which

493
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,700
hi is driven by a very different motive
then then you a consumer might be

494
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,450
motivated by

495
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,030
I this crap is a little tricky to read
but basically and I can write got this i

496
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,150
think is a Gallup poll but

497
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,120
I but it turns out that people only
slightly

498
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,270
distress hackers a little bit more and
they distrust

499
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,160
and actively will protect themselves
from advertisers advertisers are nearly

500
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,900
as bad and the public perception and get
mine is also like to the subs like a

501
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,540
survey so there is some bias

502
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,290
but its its almost the same people
visualize

503
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,640
advertisers and hackers and criminals as
almost the same right that is

504
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,810
well above government spying on them
well above anything else happening

505
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,410
and I was really interesting so why are
they so that wire had sold out what do I

506
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,760
care about at some

507
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,150
first of all they have viruses right now
they was very rarely if I am threat post

508
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,220
I am talking you're there

509
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,280
I propose Paul all these great post on

510
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,510
on our being I spun out by various
different ad networks

511
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,940
viruses in our ties and I people will
say hey

512
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,190
go down on this awesome thing you go
down the sauce us moving on to something

513
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,440
not awesome I am they waste a lot of
time on some pages that can be

514
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,450
eighty percent or more on the page wat
so if you care about performance

515
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,730
I'll Naz not helpful I

516
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,240
definitely get a much higher performance
on removing ads how the Psalms a

517
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,380
tracking which is

518
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,830
I think are the core what I'm gonna be
talking about here some people

519
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,230
kinda happen to stand by that bad but
and if you believe in all the people

520
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,350
shouldn't track what you're doing is
you're go from page page

521
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,880
you probably wouldn't my dad's the often
very offensive

522
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,510
I know this is a little small hard to
see but I but this is a

523
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,700
your meet Canadian singles whatever and
this picture is actually a shove

524
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,250
cleaning woman who committed suicide
which is why she's a newspaper so is

525
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,930
extraordinarily offense and add

526
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:19,950
I and and this is the most PG-rated non
a new offense that I could find aa

527
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,200
happened isn't the kind of stuff you see
on in a very regularly so the fence and

528
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
women and children are

529
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,150
people who have your sensibilities I do
not but I you can

530
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,170
I'm sure some people and i also really
obnoxious

531
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,670
I really terrible I am and China like
pay attention to something and do

532
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,640
something else

533
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,650
and the right move around strain my
contention I am in

534
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,750
the trying to be as offensive as he
possibly can to try and in your face for

535
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,070
trying to YouTube look at them

536
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,140
I so this is something that they are
aware I love I the more they do the more

537
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,950
you click on it

538
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,150
accidentally clicking on ads are
purposely clicking on it whenever they

539
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,820
don't care

540
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,060
on the signs that the industry is not

541
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,950
as small as I think a lot of people
think it is this is he many many many

542
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,300
times over multi-billion dollar industry

543
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,010
so in 2013 we're looking at around

544
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:12,040
forty billion dollars in the US alone I
industry-wide will be closer to 100

545
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,370
billion dollars a year

546
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,770
right and this is an interesting graph
comes from the IADB

547
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,760
sources sup selected have been absurd in
a bad way sauce liked it so this is

548
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,660
actually really good data

549
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,250
I from the advertising industry that
that belong to the idea that they can

550
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,710
track

551
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,820
so we actually know the numbers probably
higher than that I am

552
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,820
to put that in perspective a lot of
people talking about the b-2 stealth

553
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,900
bomber programming a very expensive
program

554
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,410
they can buy a B-two's tell program two
times every year

555
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,280
from now and told the attack right this
is it at every year

556
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,290
that's how much money we're talking
about I'm in fact

557
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,320
I lockheed I is the eighth largest
government

558
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,390
a lobbyist in the world followed by
Google as our Google is before them

559
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:54,820
there

560
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,870
their summer so let's change topics a
little bit to do not track and the sound

561
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,790
like it's not related

562
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,210
is all related topics I promise I get
back to the %uh explain why in a bit

563
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,170
I so the number one complaint I hear
about do not track the number one thing

564
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,840
I hear everyone say is that

565
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,130
I E 10 doesn't fall this back they say
it's useless because I didn't aspect

566
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,160
identify the suspect then we can trust
and therefore we have to turn off all

567
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,890
this kind of crazy non-threatening

568
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,740
and what you may not believe is crazy
but I'll tell you what I and so the

569
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,850
number one thing everyone says

570
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,760
they don't call us back practices in 10
do not track is before I go any further

571
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,120
his gun porn

572
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,270
now yes how much my as a do not track
base within the signal to web sites that

573
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,070
you do not want to be tracked that's the
simplest most the

574
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,250
you know I pg-rated version I could
possibly come up with but

575
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,530
its and thats affectively what they're
trying to do how many states do you

576
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,100
think do not track ass

577
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,840
anyone States

578
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,350
break

579
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,100
note and other comments do

580
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,400
hazard Brett addictive I joined other
three

581
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,360
there's three states I am butts and not
a lot of people know that

582
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,830
there's actually one state this says do
not track

583
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,050
one as one state the set which means do
not track me

584
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,860
there's one status as do not track 0
sets like a double negative like do not

585
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,680
track me not

586
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,030
I guess and stuff like that negative
that's great and has one status says

587
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,140
nothing it just doesn't send the signal
at all

588
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,410
I'm and so it turns out if you actually
look at

589
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,560
how browsers implement this almost no
one falls back properly

590
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,510
not just in an explorer they all do
something random so

591
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,160
this is when an export as I its it's
turned on by default

592
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,050
I and it just one but now it says do not
track have used once liked it wants an

593
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:42,810
HP Hatter

594
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,520
so they're not gonna spektr everyone
agrees right this is what's

595
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,440
crime does they do not have turned on I
have a turn off and then turn on the

596
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,620
side a screenshot but

597
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,390
I it's turned off by default and they
have to Settings one

598
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,310
don't say send a do not track signal or
two to nothing they have no concept the

599
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,340
Do Not Track not

600
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,260
I I this is Safari which I never use
which is why it's a

601
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,700
on selected here I but this is I

602
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,850
this again to states I asked whether not
to track me

603
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,140
or don't send a signal at all and then
Firefox they don't want to do it right

604
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,260
I are technically to the spec anyway and

605
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,620
and they have three states wanna says
and tell

606
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,020
tells me to do not want to track which
do not track one tells I thought I want

607
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,670
to be tracked

608
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,770
Do Not Track 0 Do Not Track not and
lastly do not tell

609
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,910
site anything about my tracking
preferences and the irony is actually

610
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,630
talk to the security expert now like

611
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,900
admit returned on is lightweight which
one is

612
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,820
do not track hot I don't like because
the phrasing is so bad here says do not

613
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,910
tell site anything and say that's the
party red is like okay I don't want to

614
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,230
cite

615
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,730
anything by stoned on track meet all
right and that's what he's thinking so

616
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,260
that even the phrasing here is actually
very bad so

617
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,440
I one would argue this is that doesn't a
hot mess right this whole thing is

618
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,390
terrible I'm

619
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,370
so a lot of people say no one supports
it well that's not really true

620
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,340
I Yahoo Pinterest whether they all sort
of support it I with a mixed bag when it

621
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,540
comes in and explore because they
believe their spores in doing it right

622
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,980
skills they're not by spec everyone else
is doing it right apparently

623
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,740
I but and %um and but keep in mind

624
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,600
so this is against my thoughts like to
study but 84 to 90 percent of people

625
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,130
want

626
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,860
more privacy I am be awesome

627
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,310
I into shadow puppet to do one school I
am

628
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,850
so true factors many of them them in the
news what I thought was really a really

629
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,700
great actually

630
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,310
I but because it kinda shows ecosystem
in one small snippet basically they said

631
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,410
that because Internet Explorer's has
this on because Hannah

632
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,540
as for tennis so prevalent they're just
gonna say when I can support it

633
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,780
at all for anybody for anything any
circumstance

634
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,240
and said I'm just not sneezing I it and
saying we which don't trust them there's

635
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,040
like screw when I can do for anybody now

636
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,470
I so that's kinda great that that solves
the problem right now the trucking

637
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,120
industry can

638
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,980
keep going doing what they're doing it
idea track doesn't have any me to it

639
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,690
this is awesome so let's talk about how
far away it is turn this on right how

640
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,220
many clicks does it take to get

641
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,970
do not track turned on this is an
indicator of how much work someone has

642
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,090
to go through to enable their privacy
right

643
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,230
so harris-moore is technically seven
they have a turn on by default those who

644
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,780
don't have to do any work so it's been

645
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,050
actually 0 I'm but it would be seven
online

646
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,540
Firefox yep there do with five clicks is
fun and an argument with a guy

647
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,750
privacy guys like now it's three clicks
might now it's five I

648
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,710
that's too bad they don't know I'm
neglect their own suffered experts com

649
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,660
chrome

650
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,150
is six I'll take six Plex to turn on I

651
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,780
so that's even you would imagine that's
chrome would have

652
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,710
last people's liking it because it's one
more step away as I can expense will

653
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,670
drop off every time you can add an extra
click

654
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,500
safaris 5 I don't actually have been
stopped in Safari apologize

655
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,430
I have the staff and got meds so smart
takes 5 seed imagine to be someone the

656
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,790
same neighborhood as Firefox

657
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,100
although I in practice actually think in
the last just because it the default

658
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,690
browser and people tended to use default
browser to not make change the bouncers

659
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,820
I'm so do not track

660
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,500
is kinda interesting I'm because it's
not how the spec works at how people

661
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
actually buy the company's you can use
it

662
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,250
that's what's interesting so there
actually using is do not track not

663
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,060
and nosing all are effectively the same
thing they're treating those things as

664
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,820
identical

665
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,810
I'm which is kinda instincts after all
kinds reasons but

666
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,590
hear numbers I was able to get from the
advertising industry themselves

667
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,910
I don't think they know who I am iris be
awesome but has so this is true fax

668
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,440
numbers

669
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,730
straight from them the game to me so I'm
didn't change anything about it

670
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,580
I E 10 is any 6.46 percent

671
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,610
I would seem offer low I Firefox

672
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,419
is 19.27 percent what seems about right
now actually right in the right ballpark

673
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:55,679
chrome as a 2.5 percent again I think
that's right and the reason why I think

674
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,130
I D ten is probably totally incorrect

675
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,180
it is not because I think they're lying
about the numbers I think me and at the

676
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,080
onset no reason to lie to me that in no
way I was going to use this for

677
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,790
I'm butts I but the problem he is

678
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,730
I think there's a there are so many
robots clicking on ads

679
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,000
and looking ads from an impression basis
to intentionally to defraud

680
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,620
chocolate frog clip agencies are been
advertisers

681
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,880
have for the purpose a decreasing the
fraud ratios

682
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,360
that I think that this is probably just
how much fraud they say actually are

683
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
seeing which is around 15 percent

684
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,070
I but anyway had as you can imagine
let's just pretend you're absolutely

685
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,800
accurate right I'm not gonna my god

686
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,070
double-double think this let's just use
these numbers as they are

687
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,590
this is what it actually looks like some
consumer preferences somewhere around

688
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,470
eighty six as such like that again

689
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,940
80s an even nicer 87 percent if you
average it out

690
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,240
I'll and I he is in almost a

691
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,010
exactly in parity with whites we would
expect to see if users had

692
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,890
the ability to change your browser I in
it in a way that made sense when their

693
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,800
brain

694
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,850
I really I have five minutes left band
times bring the same

695
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:08,170
and so that means the IEEE it is the
only one that is actually in parity with

696
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,640
what customers actually what what people
actually want

697
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,780
I am and so we see ad blocking I

698
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,190
basically across-the-board that makes
sense

699
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,630
mean Firefox is always going to be the
largest because how to make it the

700
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,290
easiest

701
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,270
a chrome is gonna as destroyed a newer
browser so they're kinda coming out with

702
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,970
a lot of the same software

703
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,010
so this or dad were coming anyway first
we had then we had

704
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,070
I want plus nah 14.99 use active users

705
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,300
I then add agency start paying off
adblock plus:

706
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,540
they're paying them are quite a bit of
money we don't know the actual amounts

707
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,930
I had to allow ads to go through our
price which means you can try savoir

708
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,080
plus anymore

709
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,510
then congress get involved and submit a
letter to say

710
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,830
now we don't know what's Firefox to you
a block third-party cookies because the

711
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,580
children

712
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,270
and am they don't they think Amber
Alerts are somehow going to get blocked

713
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:58,770
because

714
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,820
could be somehow turn on JavaScript or
something and it's this bizarre

715
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,550
saying anyway it's totally pimped
factually tolling cracked but whatever

716
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,030
and and because they're going payoffs
from the IB I

717
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,600
I thought this would be a lot more but
their outgoing paid I'm several thousand

718
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,430
dollars this doesn't however Google's
paying them directly

719
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,510
I so that's why we should have this
surprising ecosystem

720
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,570
I'm so remember google has forty million
dollars forty billion dollars Rep I

721
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,640
alone I'm not forget forget the

722
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,120
Maddon's going to go all their goonj I

723
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,820
I but a lot of people think why is
Firefox I'm not worried about this right

724
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,480
on ninety percent of firefighters
revenue comes from search deals

725
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,350
I've which of our on Google makes up
eighty to ninety percent run things run

726
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,100
eighty-eight percent

727
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,290
have those deals so the BOC Firefox
revenue comes from has

728
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,090
I this is last year's numbers I think
Google now has switched the numbers a

729
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,530
little bit now they got the ability
pancer also control slash mobile

730
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,890
providers not

731
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,700
I am NOT so Google is paying and Firefox
a billion dollars every three years

732
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,350
for this pleasure of I love being the
primary search bar when you for Wii

733
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,400
for that land operation corner whenever
I so we're ads

734
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,850
heading they're heading towards this the
serve not a great future where

735
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,620
I you're going to have a very slight
small set of tools like disconnect that

736
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,480
will win against most third-party
JavaScript as but not all

737
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,780
I sans some subset bass what stuff i
mean

738
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,800
as are basically turning into my rices
and they're gonna have there have all

739
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,940
the same to serve

740
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,560
filtered Asian wok was division had
stuff the C virus is just because they

741
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,740
need make money

742
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,860
I'm so advertisers will create local
source adlai true fact that's exactly

743
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,650
what they do

744
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,380
I because I'm it's much harder for a guy
like me to block because it's on the

745
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,920
same page if these heuristics for
something terrible

746
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,970
I so then companies will increase but
not tactics and say you have to enable

747
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,270
JavaScript sorry I've been able add see
my website we've already seen this kinda

748
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,910
stuff

749
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,720
there was a regulation that would be a
that the sea because consumers are get

750
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,190
past me like a we really do not want to
track anymore well we're tired of this

751
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,580
stuff

752
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,950
which is sorta bad and serve good
because you really don't want the FTC

753
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,260
writing regulation cuz I've Amber Alerts
and children in congress and whatever

754
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,010
I'm so we will probably start suing pass
in the not-too-distant future they're

755
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,860
they're always started attacking and
walkers directly

756
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,609
this is an example the prohibited
actions things won't engage in sex tv

757
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:26,119
now you're gonna take you down and then
they did they actually start removing ad

758
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,599
block from her a block

759
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,739
I like things from the from the crime
store

760
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:34,220
so so what's the so what so yes

761
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,359
do not track is a good example love
assertive one interesting fact it wasn't

762
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,109
wasn't good

763
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,319
in itself it about technology for kinda
reasons there was good for tracking and

764
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,499
basically gave us the insights we need
to know

765
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:48,869
the of in security is a bad idea of out
security is a good idea

766
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,470
I'm so we need to build technical
controls the best wing mirror that and

767
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,690
I'm and that means that we have to
support can on track as opposed to do

768
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,349
not track

769
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:59,759
I do not track doesn't work we have to
say that we

770
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:03,099
we basically prohibit our browser from
doing those bad things

771
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,349
and once advertisers learn how to play
nice then we can start

772
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:09,739
revisit this thing allowing this year
haven't done that so do you should

773
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,579
recommend my setup the Asian remember
recommend this horrible CNN world you

774
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,950
can see the anything but like syntax
right now and that the links world

775
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,809
I read something better we need
something that's more substantial than

776
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:20,769
actually works

777
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:23,769
I we need I something I

778
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:27,009
that doesn't actually impinge on
people's privacy and we need something

779
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:27,690
that isn't

780
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,329
I'll served a match we posed with what
consumers actually want

781
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,559
and at I was told that I use that
concern about lawsuits for instance

782
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,769
on that the perfectly with good reason
to be concerned about it so

783
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,440
we probably shouldn't use IE because
they're worried about lawsuits I am NOT

784
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,190
we want higher security

785
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,539
hi and privacy a tools as a percentage
of the things that come down as opposed

786
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:48,950
to

787
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,710
I other no perceive I tracking sorted
thanks

788
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,259
30 built-in browser and then alternately
gotta find a consumer because

789
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:59,109
I mean those are our family members
right those are the people that you know

790
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:03,180
we have the side West there that they're
the most important people to protect

791
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,809
I'm and they're always gonna win this
battle anyway so what's my had doing so

792
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,779
we're in a unique position where is your
conflict of interest we don't actually

793
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:12,599
make money off a bad no interest in
tracking people

794
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,269
I its survey unique position I we don't
believe in this do not track concept

795
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,339
I'm we believe in cannot track by miss
lee of thing everybody

796
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:24,579
out have security as opposing optimum
into security I you have to do stuff to

797
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:27,099
try offer security as opposed to do
stuff to turn on security

798
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:30,180
I'm so we got this thing called aviator

799
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,819
on the you may have heard about its Mac
only I were eventually gonna make making

800
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:34,269
its

801
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:37,980
available on Windows platform as well
I'll but this is a sort of our first

802
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,499
salvo at trying to do work round or
chrome made the internet faster we're

803
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,430
gonna try to make it a lot more secure
and private

804
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,579
so I'm outta time but thank you so much
everybody appreciates
