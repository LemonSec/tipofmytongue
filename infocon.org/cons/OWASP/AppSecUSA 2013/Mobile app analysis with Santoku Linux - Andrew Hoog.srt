1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,060
alright good morning everybody I am were
a couple minutes late here so go ahead

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,030
and get started

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,650
on this talk is gonna be on more the
security mobile forensic mobile malware

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,539
analysis

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,700
with the distro that my company

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,180
built a couple years I guess a little
over a year ago now called Santo cool

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,750
annex

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,190
onto this would be kinda hand on I'll
give you some background information

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,270
complied but I made you cum

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,010
some live demo Cup on as well just my
background

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,110
the cofounder and CEO I'm got a number
book published on my

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,940
a pretty active on the on the technical
side of things

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,989
on and so I and you think a lot of
different conferences and and things of

14
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:41,980
that sort as well

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,810
on and get my company we've been around
since 2009

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,640
we got right around 40 employees and
down

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,149
but handed them a focused on really hard
core mobile R&D

18
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,630
a in so you probably know them in their
names from

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,780
different conferences and think that
sort we also try to contribute a lot to

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,610
open source

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,809
on into bigger just a few of the project
that we dined

22
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,990
we just recently finished up to get you
my jewel

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,760
for this wicked aunt if you do an
Android forensics work

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,299
and you use this with Kate we we've got
a module in there now to parse

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,010
yet to file system wanted think I'll
show you today

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,380
it logical which is an open-source to
invade forensic

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,060
package you can use to build a top and a
divided into court in total annex

28
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,960
will be a big part of what we talk about
on if you're on the application

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,930
development site at things we also

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,970
a public best practices document um

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,310
for water all the things that we he
developer you do wrong

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,409
when the right mobile app then in how do
you do it the right way to their best

33
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,180
practices

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,920
up under presentations you find all this
on our website

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,509
so on that a lot of free stuff go out
there check it out we try to it but it

36
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,430
might out there

37
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,750
as we can so near the question is is why
did we do santoku

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,930
and what we found was that

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,560
I mean he were a mobile company and just
to give me some stats around that

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,789
either number that I T he provided I i
cant earlier this year

41
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,849
in in 2012 looking at laptop desktop

42
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,200
I'd tablet and smartphone I worldwide
there a one-point

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,450
you billion new devices bought in 2012

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,480
and you can feel the kid desktops and
laptops

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,819
represented counted and tablet there you
know a bit lower but getting right

46
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,970
around the deaths that number

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,709
but smartphone they're by far the
biggest at approaching seven hundred

48
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,810
million divided

49
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,750
you look forward to 2017 dope on desktop
go down a little bit so we're still

50
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,739
going to you think that topped one
replaced them

51
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,349
laptop go up quite a bit but here's the
real growth you see about triple growth

52
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:48,980
in tablets may be up to $700 million in
smartphones are wary of two charts with

53
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,620
about 1.5 billion new this smartphone
and mobile devices will be bought

54
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,300
when you think about the number mobile
apt that sit behind that

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,629
you basically have a tremendous amount
of velocity in this market

56
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,170
a lot of challenges that I thing and our
pride in people going to be facing about

57
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,170
how do we think here at what's going on

58
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,269
what operating into we look at that
market obviously and we we built the

59
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,269
company around it

60
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,280
and said you know what are the tools
that you need

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,610
too kind to get involved in it paid into
this is

62
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,879
misses a snap shot from that our
previous version and

63
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,750
tanto could get somebody to love.mp3
bundle for you guys and what we found

64
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,690
was that

65
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,780
our development and R&D teams we're
spending

66
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,180
hours running the latest cool getting it
updated repackaging it and then we take

67
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,040
the output from one version

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
and another guy could you get with it
Billy we've got we've got a business

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,349
built around it let's get some
consistency that get that out

70
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,870
onto the community as well so we started
taking best to breed

71
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,099
tools that we use for friend executing
our now

72
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,489
said we put it into a in Ubuntu I

73
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,659
so and down we we set up by I dot dead

74
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,170
you know repo so that you can eat it go
out there apt-get update

75
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,610
import on the latest without having to
build them yourselves we can take quite

76
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,629
a bit I'm

77
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,819
you can download the I still straight
from Monsanto clinic

78
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,370
our website on if you already have your
you know Virgin Atlantic up and running

79
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,069
you can literally just at our repo on
key your current down

80
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:21,199
I Ubuntu boxer or dead incompatible box

81
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,580
on and then just do a apt-get install
tanto Q

82
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,770
it'll hold on all the tools and
dependencies for you automatically

83
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,159
ok so happy do that if you can

84
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,330
dollar I so you reboot then you end up
having a I'm

85
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,389
you know a fully loaded into the lake
you can do it bare metal

86
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,240
you can do it in a VM on wall street
today is running inside a VM

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,990
on the only challenge did I mention we
do stuff inside to be an

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,189
it down the virtual machine is gonna sit
between

89
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,749
your device that you're investigating or
you're analyzing

90
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:58,110
and your host operating system and you
can call USB arbitration

91
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,669
so they're passing that USB connection
from your physical hosted virtual

92
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,629
machine

93
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,119
on it works great on VMware Fusion if
you're mad person

94
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:10,849
it work okay and other situation but you
sometimes have problems especially like

95
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,639
iPhones running on Windows

96
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,949
you get you run into them issue there so
if you have an old laptop lying around

97
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,610
and you're tinkering around the studying
go bare metal and we also do will be

98
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,129
buddhist offer thumb drive of a solid
state drives out you know of a CD-rom

99
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,379
onto the number different way that you
can do this a VM the court he has been

100
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,399
recognized

101
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,509
you know that you may run into a few a
challenge if you got

102
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,979
community arbitration going on

103
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,759
so let me just take you through in by
the way to got questions please

104
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,059
interrupt along the way I'm happy to
answer

105
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:46,309
questionid

106
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:49,379
noapte it would be if you mean if you
already have a Linux box that you're

107
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,099
using an installed and that's just going
to put in all the different binary going

108
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:53,909
to do you think

109
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:57,919
down on the i three you need to worry
about any of it and I just got booed up

110
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,919
the way it did

111
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,669
yep I have not tried doing it on Kali

112
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,080
on they get made a move to dot dead
themselves and it would probably work we

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,199
make and clicked on a few too old

114
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,949
arm in you know at that point in time
you know they were still

115
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,689
primary emphasis on nom pen testing and
what not

116
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,179
in in the mood to Kali and they have
some mobile tools in their

117
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:25,689
on are only focuses on mobile and so we
don't want to get out and it goes out

118
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,330
there but you know we we can look at
need to be one that

119
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,960
it'd be focused only on mobile on said
probably work but there may be some 20

120
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,219
the complex I'm not sure

121
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,960
in

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,589
so when you you we say what you mean by
that up

123
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,809
oh you mean running like Android
emulator ABT yet yet you can do that

124
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,899
yet because we bonded the 400 STK and
therefore your you can run ABT's

125
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,800
as much as you want just make sure you
get an anagram

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,209
dead

127
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:04,869
on Dec a great question to them at all
what I hear a pretty good answer for

128
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:05,379
that I am

129
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,779
I don't have the best answer for it on
more week that I believe a crime if i'm

130
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,069
wrong. if anybody knows

131
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,099
on actually a some

132
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,809
originally started party to a dartboard
DHS bass track

133
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:23,679
if I'm not and we took a look at that
distro but I think we went on counted

134
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,659
around a little and how it maintains

135
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,669
help probably be are

136
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:31,719
trying to do the same thing they're two
separate distros

137
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:37,509
com and down I haven't looked at their
destroying a while but down

138
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,529
out you know we used our you'll find out
that all our product to go to the public

139
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,629
and cocoa and everybody and I'll I'm

140
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,309
I did download can cope with it I normal
bike you I tell

141
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:50,860
because it already had you know ATB &

142
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,939
on the icon back up to look at
everything pre-installed so

143
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,369
but there's probably deprived both 22
thinking

144
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:01,429
good great question by the way how that
people to happen and there's never any

145
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:02,669
question so

146
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,899
I love it on you know be a friend if we
started out as a friend X company still

147
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,939
be core part of what we do

148
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,020
obviously based on the name and down

149
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,949
I wanna run you can get a little bit a
background on forensics for those who

150
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,110
viewed it may not be all that familiar
with it

151
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,029
on beard friend Nick Folk look at three
different ways that we pulled a to offer

152
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,169
devices and you know back in the day
when all you to worry about your

153
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,209
computer

154
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:29,360
it's pretty straightforward pull out the
dry attack to write blocker dump all the

155
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,050
data and then go and allied with some
cool

156
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,940
and Courtney challenges in mobile phone
I can pull the drive out but it's a lot

157
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,500
harder I gotta do schiphol

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,458
and I gotta re ball and I gotta connect
it up maybe do you think a tag work

159
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,949
um so it's really complicated and
obviously

160
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,050
I remember early on going to conference
did where kinda traditional friendly

161
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,149
people getting a big argument
mobile-friendly

162
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,079
guidance and we're changing the fighting
in modifying installing an agent

163
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,199
you can't do that in any kind of
religious debate up for five years ago

164
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,779
about mobile forensic

165
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,860
the industry's really come around in
recognizing that

166
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,259
you know their way that we can have a
very light footprint and that we can

167
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,629
really detail what we do on the device

168
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:13,410
on but unless you want to take
everything okay and go to get a good

169
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,350
shape of

170
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,379
you going to be making some sort
modification if we can do it in RAM only

171
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,959
or from a bootloader where we never
touch the core OS a great

172
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,069
if we can't do it allotted time then for
indicated

173
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:28,029
time is of the essence you need to get
your hands on this day to try to figure

174
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:28,750
out

175
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,899
you know whatever the case is driving me
toward infill

176
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,040
i'm for that reason mobile forensic a
different computer forensics

177
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,019
on but Kentucky did a lot of
similarities to the three types of

178
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,230
acquisitions that we do to the logical
there's a file system is a physical

179
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,779
analogical file system is essentially
because I like a backup

180
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,699
you at the operating system to give you
the file to it willing to share

181
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,430
and its gonna hand you back and data and
that difference between I like an

182
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,800
Android and Windows Phone in how you
doing what he did

183
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm it's not going to be deleted data it
bath

184
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,310
on the date is usually pretty well
structured to know exactly what coming

185
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,889
back and we can put into the right rows
and columns

186
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:11,399
on but on it often limit how much data
we can get

187
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,250
and you have to get on the path coded
and let somebody like ATB debugging on

188
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,949
you gotta be able to get into the device
that one county based on logical

189
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:26,139
a filesystem it did step further into
ended it and basically thing look

190
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:29,300
can I come back and get back in the
operating system for a backup mechanism

191
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,290
if you will

192
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,720
let me at the operating system Q to hear
all the files

193
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,089
that go on the complete file system is a
typically need privileges to do this

194
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,189
the advantage to doing a file system
backup is that you get again well

195
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,149
structured data

196
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,050
you see that in a minute you know file
database type thing that

197
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,170
or you can call them all down here now
you get quite a bit more data

198
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,430
but typically it does require privilege
on the device

199
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,939
I'm the last thing it kinda be typically
to go love the forensic investigation is

200
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,350
going to do a physical image

201
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,860
and that again back in the in the hard
drive David remove it put on a write

202
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,290
blocker in have a 10 copy

203
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,370
the original did on and in in

204
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,759
mobile phones you could you keep popping
JK or you can get

205
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,009
privileges on the device in really do
like a DD

206
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,879
a paperback copy 0 up the name and a
flash drive

207
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,769
copied all did a great thing about that
is that we recover deleted data

208
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:29,050
and you know i testified two weeks ago
in Dallas on on a homicide case where

209
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,189
the case is thinking made it complete
turn based on that

210
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:35,199
3d data in reconstructing what had
happened

211
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:39,839
um the challenges that you're looking at
a gigabyte or sticking the raw data now

212
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,439
you have to reassemble the pieces
together by hand

213
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,500
sometimes you can mount them and valid
file system

214
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,449
sometimes you can't I am so we can be
much more tedious

215
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,990
so they just three types a friend to get
with Asians on

216
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,480
I've been traveling a lot and I spoke at
an iPhone in my bag and

217
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,810
if the I pointing in Chicago Dominic a
key to the iPhone part in it with wide

218
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,529
and then I do i download on Android

219
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,720
to on so I O act is is one main platform
that we support

220
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
it could be a logical acquisition it
requires that you put the pen

221
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,490
there's no way around that but if you're
sitting at home are working your tanker

222
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,680
and saying hey

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,389
your sensitive data on that device that
may put near Maple my company at risk

224
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:23,810
hit a pretty simple way to do a cat on
you put your pain after you use your apt

225
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,100
to think that your data

226
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,370
I'm plugging into tanto Kalinic and then
you run this command iDevice back up to

227
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,819
on you give it the you know the Berber
the the action to go back up and then

228
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,699
you provided a backup directory

229
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:41,310
in what is it then she doing it
mimicking an iTunes backup

230
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,410
and it would hold on all the files on
and then

231
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,819
the I came back to back to the bay 64
encoded data

232
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,339
and so you can run affecting commanded
on back up this directory three turn it

233
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,720
into real images in real people I'd
filed and things of that sort

234
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,439
and then you can simply go in there in
view the data by hand

235
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:01,540
um and you know start examining the data

236
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,339
this is that what the command look like
when you run it on it is basically

237
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,699
connect

238
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,990
on one other thing that doesn't it
exchanges on

239
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,379
certificate so you are modifying the
device

240
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,610
you have to recognize that is that he
had to testify in court and things of

241
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,610
that sort

242
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,240
on but that's the way I can't work I can
die from working today exchange

243
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,379
certificate

244
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,800
they damage to a connection and then
they download the information

245
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,120
and could just go through does the
backup pulls down all the files

246
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,660
now if you look at those files on their
all shy one

247
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,920
%uh the file name to take the at the
mess that DB a shower warning rename it

248
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,699
to the

249
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:45,269
along you know shot shy one signature
and it becomes very tedious to look at

250
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,610
the

251
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,879
things on by hand and so we bundled

252
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,459
on an open source doctor and out there
called iPhone backup analyzer

253
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,790
on this this guy thing based on Italy
are you doing it PHB

254
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,370
and it has become his PhD thesis he
actually

255
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,949
updated to all said the burden that we
bundled in 10 2004 so when we update to

256
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:08,819
the next version a santoku

257
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:12,209
you can get you have to get up in court
on the deb file but

258
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,309
were up a good latest version which he
switched from

259
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:18,480
on ppl from Tikal Huang I

260
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,189
qt4 and he wrote in Python so there's a
lot of ability to get

261
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:27,709
at a new partner in there plugging in
oMG and you're off to the races but

262
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,889
he'll take a road on decoding Shaw 1

263
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,699
on having you know viewers for on your
image file you people like databases

264
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,949
and you basically have a nicer way to
rip through to stop and look at

265
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:42,410
text messages and images and things of
that sort

266
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,189
but again any interest to time I'm just
going to skip through the I O S II more

267
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,279
than a hundred job anyway so

268
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,399
on and in getting the Android doubt

269
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,730
so I'm Android we we we built into all
the

270
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,089
years ago called a up logical and down

271
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,519
we actually gave away free to law
enforcement on

272
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,100
and dad it download about fifty or sixty
different types have

273
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,389
up information of an Android device on
but a year or two ago we basically

274
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,350
decided to open source that package

275
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,990
on in so you can go on to get help right
now download the code

276
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,240
grab grab the ATK run it yourself on

277
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,629
me open source version took for the
datatype

278
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:27,029
call log data Matt few things like that
and implemented DoD

279
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,149
on but we didn't down with improv 55
them in their anybody can going to begin

280
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:34,790
to expand and add to it if they want
because it's just sitting out there

281
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:40,459
on and a in Android there's a a logical
mechanism called content providers

282
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,540
so it reads the content providers and
this is the way apt can share data

283
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,809
on download it and put it into a txt
file

284
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:53,459
and we originally to keep it simple we
just start on the SD card

285
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,970
if you're doing a real friend
investigation I don't recommend that

286
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,699
what you really want to do is is what
we've implemented in our commercial

287
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,069
product did

288
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:05,319
we added code in there to turn it into a
server thank you I can that character

289
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,749
into you read the content providers we
can act and over port 8000 in one or

290
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:10,430
whatever

291
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,589
and we didn't talk to the agency
immediate that data

292
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:18,259
in extreme doubt over net cattle report
8,000 using a TD port forwarding

293
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,279
so that how you want to do it in a
forensic instance but this is more but

294
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:22,680
kinda

295
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,660
open source free I you know mess around
with it

296
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,610
on your own device and I'll go ahead and
show you on

297
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,319
how that worked with and what it really
looks like you could you not be able to

298
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,490
see it from here

299
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,879
but you push the app you select on you
make sure yet to make sure that USB

300
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,040
debugging is on

301
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,480
I'm you install the app you run it you
select the type the day that you want to

302
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,800
download you click the button

303
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,779
it downloaded and it saved to the SD
card and then you can call that data of

304
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,119
so need to the commander little bit
Hardesty I'm gonna go ahead and switch

305
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,259
now

306
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:01,189
on who a my virtual machine in

307
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,449
and I will hopefully make missing you
guys can

308
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,669
he added

309
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:13,449
taper stability that legible at all I
can get not rated

310
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,240
yet now that did not require you to read
the device this is a logical acquisition

311
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,779
on me

312
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,789
good me see if I can you mend it all

313
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:30,700
no in right it big enough for ninety two
men were created

314
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,580
yet to see it okay of them I took I just
wanted to get the right now I have a

315
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,640
them tonight connected over 80 be on

316
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,049
he already had ATB debugging on which
means that

317
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:45,140
I don't act even have had to pass code I
can to get into the device and pull the

318
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,340
data off right now

319
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,510
I'm ATB it called the Android i/debug
burrito and allow you to communicate

320
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,179
with the device

321
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,309
on and down ok

322
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,330
Iran to me the commander here today to
make sure that they're gonna work so I'm

323
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,360
just gonna keep hearing is my history

324
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,890
the first thing that we're gonna do it
made you a TD install

325
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,039
and we're gonna installed be open source
a PK

326
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,789
you can download the app and get hard
you can modify it you can have it in you

327
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,909
think whatever

328
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:15,700
this is simply going to do an install
thank you don't have to

329
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,929
you know go to the place or something
along those lines and install it

330
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:19,520
manually

331
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,110
this is basically side loading apparatus
be and you can see that

332
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,390
it downloaded it pushes it to the device
attack you right out the

333
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,899
i'd a local temp on and then it did the
install

334
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,250
now from there the app that keeps
hitting on the device you can go in

335
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,010
there you can navigate you can run it

336
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,429
um but let's say that the device was
locked in a TV with turned on and you

337
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:42,779
simply wanted to

338
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:46,870
on to go in there automatically run that
you can then city come in here

339
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,370
and get you a shell command to run it
and

340
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,429
though the setting up calling it quote
to the primacy that on the no to hear

341
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:58,580
it's running on

342
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,710
I missed an acid alternate screen
changes and need to do we popped up now

343
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,149
we made it where you actually have to
hit the button

344
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:12,360
for capture coming to do here capture it
took two seconds gonna lie date on here

345
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,529
it put the data out I'm onto the SD card

346
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,890
and then um you basically can come in
here and there to a commanding a TD

347
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,250
called

348
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,250
ATT poll on good

349
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,679
and I'm using creative director here
called it logical data

350
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,580
on and I'm gonna pull the data down of
the SD card so what it's doing right now

351
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,260
the thing occurs a poll grab that
directory

352
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,750
brings everything down to the local
filesystem and then we can come over

353
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,640
here

354
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,940
in

355
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,230
you the local filesystem and you'll see
that we only brought in a few

356
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,320
repeated that information I can tell you
that 60 70 80 things like this you can

357
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,929
pull down if he did add content
providers we

358
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,980
you know we didn't put that in the open
source one but anybody can make that

359
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,169
modification

360
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:03,510
if we pull in Call of contact and that
an SMS

361
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,059
and one of my mms pictures I happen to
be what we're working on a project where

362
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:08,710
on

363
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,760
we read breaking into lot burner phone

364
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,640
I something that DHS sponsored still
looking at the bootloader is buying

365
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,740
Boehner do it it's amazing

366
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,730
on how many things we can get into so if
your drug dealer and you doing burner

367
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,200
phone

368
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,390
be careful an opening to get our but

369
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,120
on so they did the picture of all the
phones that we were we were working on

370
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,140
it they came in and got hit again

371
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,690
but it's pretty interesting a component
data of I'm you can look at Wii Wii

372
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,730
bundle something

373
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,679
II all the data about the device in at
XML document

374
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,740
so you can pull down in he here

375
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,000
I can you mend things like you know what
what what with the daytime

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,220
what with the IMEI MSI phone numbers

377
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,789
you know what did the hardware version
that you're running and then we actually

378
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,330
called on every single application

379
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,740
onto the Q got data and predicate I did
a couple weeks ago impacted

380
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,630
a it's a it's a bad is a bad Katie me if
you if you're from tech you probably

381
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,990
know about it but

382
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,210
this guy ended up installing an app
called fake SMS and call logger

383
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,450
any fake text messages and phone calls
from his victim

384
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,250
on trying to prove that he was lying and
things of that sort

385
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,620
but he to uninstall the app and so

386
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,049
the secret service and under
investigation using Stella bright and a

387
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:33,140
stall from in with like that the app
installed but with no longer installed

388
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,480
so was it on the device anymore so you
can use information like this

389
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,700
to see what with their he could Kildare
and then what we ended up doing it is

390
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,419
that we knew it had been deleted

391
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:46,460
so we went in and did a physical image
on that device and when we ran our

392
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,730
recovery against that physical image

393
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,539
we found the data about the application
without all the text messages and call

394
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,840
logs that he had fake

395
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,010
and we're even a piece back together on

396
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,440
you know the entire time line 0 what
happened

397
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,840
so we provide you that information here
I meet about the apt on the phone when I

398
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,019
in Acton are not going to kick in the UN
you can part

399
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:13,149
on and then for instead on this is my
demo phone so I use it as I'm going

400
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:16,690
around in different conferences I was in
California couple weeks ago

401
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm doing a demo and down wanted a guy
that works for me let the gene exon the

402
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,529
cable

403
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,049
anytime I keep on a table like to meet
mine site grand all the phones in

404
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,450
Cheltenham in my backpack and went back
to my room in 10 minutes later

405
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,679
I got the frantic call for me and I
think I can't find my phone anywhere do

406
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,000
you have a gene acting in their

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,649
in a court that kinda the history that
you're seeing here this is Ryan asking

408
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,380
me about he

409
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,740
you left it and then I said yeah I found
him on my way to the lobby

410
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,590
so you'll be able to pull in 100
thousands 10,000

411
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,049
amazing how much people text message we
had to rewrite our apt because up

412
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,010
we're helping I agency with the and
italic ligation case in that guy with

413
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,220
with you talking all the kids any send
over 50,000 technically the month

414
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,510
in our application initially was written

415
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,730
to read the entire at the Met writing to
a file

416
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,169
and then send it out and we had to start
Chongqing and two thousand

417
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,169
count at a time because there is still
much

418
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,700
SMS messages going on it back I think on
an angry one fire one pic device when

419
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,480
they only had

420
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
at Gatorland get made on but in any
event lifted out there it

421
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,130
it freely downloadable anybody can use
it on

422
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,519
and I'll just show you one other thing
tilt I'm we have came up

423
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,659
32 out there where you can download be
extracted

424
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,870
in a demo version any to take those 65

425
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,490
content providers i talked about it give
you data from all them

426
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,269
it did give you the first 10 record only
and this is a beta version of our latest

427
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:50,320
so what we do is a is the company's we
take command line tools which is what we

428
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,200
use we build on the open for some upon

429
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,610
and then broke for a commercial product
we wrap a good way around it

430
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,330
and I'm not gonna take you through the
whole acquisition process but I did one

431
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,049
this morning real quick on the

432
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:06,090
same device and you the AF logical
behind-the-scene

433
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,320
and I just give you sent four instead at
this point on a few things

434
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,019
you know what you can really end up
seeing in these you know browser history

435
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,269
brother searches we go it scares me

436
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,620
likely does nothing embarrassing there
and

437
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,630
admit a bookmark on I

438
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,679
you know and and I and he ended up
stopping at one point because there were

439
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:27,899
too many I'm

440
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,960
videos they were getting pulled down on

441
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,120
this is actually me talking at a thought
time

442
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,440
earlier this year and one of our guys to
grab that grabbed the phone or taking

443
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
pictures at it so

444
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,409
I'm on this phone alone there's probably
twenty thousand pieces and a

445
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:47,299
de ti couple of the day I'm using a more
comprehensive

446
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,630
a logical analysis and so defended
giving you a sense for you know what

447
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,049
does it look like if u

448
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,130
on you can actually end up getting a
report

449
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,220
network called on all the data on you
put it in and i felt format where you

450
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,200
like you know what you know what with
all pull down

451
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,409
on have you got a picture thumbnails
over the web site that you visited

452
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,070
and it was really really important at my
facebook page by the way

453
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,760
this was really important in the in the
latest case that we did

454
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,789
because we were able to go back and
recreate beyond

455
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:21,549
the actual web pages that he visited on
and

456
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,600
he with logging into Facebook and three
separate users

457
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,769
in with basically trying to that to from

458
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,850
to set up a relationship with this girl
using fake Facebook pages as well

459
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:39,240
so this is the kinda dating you can pull
off simply from a logical analysis

460
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,450
K I need to speed things up a little bit

461
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,340
Mobile Security just give you a quick
background for the movie that came from

462
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,980
a security standpoint mobile there's a
lot overlap between traditional security

463
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,960
web security in mobile but mobile
combined quite a few other things

464
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,179
together

465
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,820
and so we we often say it at you know
Mobile has a large attack surface

466
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,470
bigger than a moron or bigger than a web
app because the web after he began to

467
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,750
paint at the web server sequined action

468
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,179
with a mobile app you have to worry
about to divide the ap

469
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:11,740
encryption you have to worry about
networks like man in the middle in

470
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,450
Indian at

471
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,970
hoofing it to worry about of the things
like people injection that the big

472
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,889
mistake

473
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:20,320
that we he mobile app developers make
they think because

474
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,710
the data coming in from a nap they
control they don't worry bout

475
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,480
sanitizing it and will simply go through
and look at the URL that they connect

476
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,080
you

477
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,100
get right around the mobile app hit
their website with their permission

478
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,669
you will follow those services what do
people injection attack

479
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:38,850
you know input validation errors on in
at work

480
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,210
it worked beautifully so if you're in
InfoSec team at a large company

481
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,809
really start to encourage the dead to
think about

482
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,620
in the impact on your own analysis it's
not just about being think that I can

483
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,669
out only after

484
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:55,010
on it old it will be a much much bigger
actor tate

485
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,549
on in the mobile world and so difficult
to do is treat this for you

486
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:03,399
um we rate we we have a for a a mobile
security product that does

487
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:07,570
you know security testing on I like an
Android and we regularly run app through

488
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,110
that offer the App Store just a

489
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,730
to test are our application make sure
that it's operating properly

490
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,610
so recently we we look at about eighty
ap

491
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,419
on finance lifestyle that they're
basically the most popular app

492
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:24,240
that you can find on the App Store for
for both I like an Android

493
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,750
and here in the finding that we had on

494
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,750
15 percent I O S twenty percent Android
app

495
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,009
mailman al now that is completely
solvable

496
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:38,259
in frankly completely inexcusable

497
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:43,720
on want to think that dawned on me
recently is more more website consumer

498
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,559
website her

499
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,340
asking for good password and

500
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,220
it a typical nute can type in path 123
or 1234 5+ anymore

501
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,200
so what do you do you go back to a comp
like pat word members

502
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,190
what the complex actually remember 21 at
work maybe you

503
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,309
force you to do when you can login to
domain so

504
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:08,460
you know back in the day I P well tell
me get your paper packard so what

505
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,590
I work at a company with a domain in a
complex password well my contention is

506
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,059
and maybe not supported by the password
on that we get right now but as more and

507
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,480
more website

508
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,019
fourth on better password the end user
to begin a TI menu that one pass for the

509
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:25,360
Guardian my brain at work maybe do

510
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,850
and so you know that's why man in the
middle matters

511
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,500
if I know your first name add your last
name if I know by today did that

512
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,320
that ten to fifteen percent you're after
sending across the network about you and

513
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,919
I know the password or password that you
use that enough information for me to

514
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:40,860
get inside your

515
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,070
your corporate persona maybe it
certainly give me a huge

516
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,779
a I'm kinda read start on this head
start on it

517
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,899
so completely solvable completely
inexcusable and it's still happening at

518
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,080
a very alarming rate if you ask me

519
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,070
on effect I want to point out to you
that storing passwords in plain pack

520
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,590
Asian every store password any peace
toward and you have hit okay fine but

521
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,980
you're prolly gonna saw you know

522
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,419
a brute force or a military attack a
rainbow table attack

523
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:15,549
but these are people after scoring in
plain packs in 25 percent I'll II what

524
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:17,259
happened we tested for your password

525
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:20,230
in plain text on the device so the
frantic technique that we're talking

526
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,309
about today will recover that password

527
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,580
immediately on and then

528
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,230
you know in memory I think that's what
the main issue but just kinda look at

529
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,509
that last category one we look across
from all the security testing

530
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:34,669
on 75 percent Ohio it fifty percent

531
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:38,970
Android app fail at least one high risk
category foreign

532
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,559
and that yet in

533
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,940
good

534
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,340
good

535
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,100
I think that's a great point there
certainly is bias here because we're

536
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,880
choosing the most popular app for iPhone
Android

537
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,550
and even though banking after popular
they're not as popular as

538
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,140
Facebook they're not as popular as other
app along those lines up but what I will

539
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,260
say is that this is

540
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,990
you much more toward companies that make
money

541
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,760
on mobile if you're going to be in the
top 50 apt

542
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,810
you need to have a business model that
you're getting more touchpoint

543
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,660
where you have a direct you know
purchase business model where they're

544
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,670
spending money on your mobile app so

545
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,970
this doesn't represent the guy AR gal
hacking out code in their in their

546
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,300
apartment and I can pay that code a lot
worse so there's definitely buy it here

547
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,410
on it's a very small sample 2 million
apathy you can take eighty 180 that a

548
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,620
representative sample

549
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,630
up the entire chapter but my contention
will be will probably

550
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,820
the worst statistic as we expand into
the last because in a bigger company

551
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,110
you have key way to do it security folks
who do have people go to training

552
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:57,060
on in the other folks don't need you
just don't do that

553
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,670
they should be in theory because they've
got their own a 100 million pound

554
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:08,170
you know on still a real quick to wide
mobile security difficult would it a lot

555
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,960
of people in it

556
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,640
in the day alright there's the OS
Developer that Apple and Google court

557
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
mike was talking to and download I'd

558
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,400
like state app on Google today you've
got to do might manufacture

559
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,470
Samsung Toshiba and they've got the
wireless carriers all three of these

560
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,830
guys write code

561
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,800
with system where ru privilege it and
deploy ap hear phone app that you

562
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,870
typically can't remove

563
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,230
and down the latest poll known in Japan
damn thing at four fell

564
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:42,120
here even if Elway a bind sleeve guided
putting after your platform

565
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,490
that you may be eating from for
corporate or your customers may be using

566
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,310
and their did a lot a boner believe in
them on the app developers and tell who

567
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,440
are you gonna touched on it

568
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,860
32 professional app developers or their
coding at night

569
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,220
on either way you know we're finding
that the app developers don't have the

570
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,910
training that they need in fact

571
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,270
on not only do we have our best
practices document about forty pages

572
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,860
long

573
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,120
it how do you not make these mistakes we
partnered about a year ago a CompTIA

574
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,450
and I'm a couple weeks ago I'm he
released to their

575
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,030
mobile app security plus certification
but you aren't fifty bach

576
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,950
its certified from then it's not really
a small company thing oh come to I think

577
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,320
it hurt so it's a real company that
certification

578
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,290
and they do it for I like an Android so
if you're looking at you know something

579
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,260
you can run your dad

580
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,490
through the kind up their game on you
know there's a a certification out there

581
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,860
that came out a few weeks ago that we
think is gonna start gaining some

582
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,130
traction in the industry

583
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,670
on company the court to try to protect
their mobile devices and last but not

584
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,730
least you can

585
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,710
picky and your honor this because you
may be a kid wanted too late for an

586
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,170
angry birds begin at the credit card
number to the side loaded from a

587
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,920
to a website somewhere and it happens to
be Trojan

588
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,320
so be here all the actors that are
involved in in that mobile security

589
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,150
dance

590
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,640
so I'm gonna pick on a very public at
here

591
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,680
any got do you had the five million

592
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,810
in muted um there wanna be worth mobile
app you've ever looked at

593
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,850
on they exemplify it

594
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,350
date Kate are are commercial be a lab
product

595
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,360
any demonstrate every capability
politics that because they fail

596
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,560
every security has pretty much and that
we done for the closer to them greet

597
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,470
under CEO we call their offices week i
think im on Twitter

598
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,600
we have absolutely no response from them
so six months ago we did a full

599
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,960
disclosure in our website

600
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,360
you know some security gate noted and
then everybody else forgot about it and

601
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,750
on market any that do I'm putting pretty
much any other user that a complete fool

602
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,420
risk

603
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,010
um and do we have a write-up on line
about you can go check it out

604
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,620
I'm you know what would you do then to
take a look at any dot do

605
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,970
you think tanto Kalinic and so

606
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,370
I'm actually gonna run you through it
from a quite pinpoint here and I'm a

607
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,630
demonstrated live with malware because
there's a very similar process that you

608
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,300
run through some precautions you take me
looking at now we're

609
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,910
but one of the things that were you
really big on it forensic analysis

610
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,240
so run the app you did

611
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,690
and then ADB pull the data down just the
way we did from the SD card

612
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,780
but now do it from the application
directory in go look at those files and

613
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,360
try to understand what day to get
persisted out there

614
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,340
how did stored on and then second a ball

615
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,390
on get into some basic dynamic in out
this week you can do we think oku

616
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,930
when it goes well for you so so what we
end up doing is

617
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,100
we have a little wifi dongle that we

618
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,600
we'd have to the computers laptops you
can you built in wifi q1

619
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,310
but we take in total lending attack your
WiFi to it

620
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,080
in turn it into an access point and then
you take your your mobile phone

621
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,070
and you think that getting out to the
Internet over salad from other thing had

622
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,190
to go out the Internet

623
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,810
310 total Eric now you they could become
the man in the middle

624
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,200
and you can do anything security testing
that you want it's very very simple

625
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,960
arcade a command here how to do it

626
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,570
so that it allows you to basically run
the app capture the traffic can begin to

627
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,780
do analysis on

628
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:03,270
what ten in cleantech can remain in the
middle then can we do have to sell

629
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,440
thread

630
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,980
com you can even put your own
certificate to the device

631
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,470
certificate authority marketed valid and
do for SSL

632
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,670
interception in in Bay City look at
proxying in and understand what's going

633
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,730
on

634
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,320
so when you take a look in this is a
screenshot from IO as we take a look at

635
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,590
the data file

636
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,910
than any that do we going around on you
end up finding right here it may be a

637
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,920
bit hard to see

638
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,760
I'm sitting right inside the preferences
file they have password

639
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,000
here's your password username spam

640
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,030
all that information stored in plain
packaging tight-lipped buyout as well as

641
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,170
into the database files on android

642
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,120
so by just running the app on and then
pulling it down

643
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,180
on the data you can do a simple great
command in CT information let me

644
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,030
we switch back real quick this

645
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,410
and show you how you might do this from
a command line

646
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm

647
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,070
so one of the things about and rated

648
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,580
reconnect my device here

649
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,780
I want to think about and rated that you
can basically

650
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,550
on

651
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,640
okay we're back online on you can go
through an end to this is a rooted

652
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,140
device to bear in mind when you

653
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,760
carrying out this thing you want to get
to the data directory enters that P cap

654
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,960
in all that you've got everybody on the
device

655
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,070
so you have a special device that you
use

656
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,900
for security testing but here are you
doing a quick lifting

657
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,490
a every app that sitting in the data
directory and you can

658
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,530
you know if your command line person you
can easily run that through crap

659
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,550
on in look for any that new

660
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,510
or any other app that you want so you
know here is the

661
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,910
you know any doubt do so you could
simply come here and say a TV poll

662
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:02,470
such data last day is last what is this
why netcom died

663
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,040
any do gonna build the file it anything
upon all the files

664
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,470
and then we could come in here

665
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,520
on in actually putting it on topic
correctly but here you got for instance

666
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,210
the databases directory

667
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,270
and here's all the different databases
that

668
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,540
on any that do create you can barely
open those things up

669
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,240
you can grab on

670
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,420
you can grab for different patterns and
look through the data

671
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,790
the pulling down the forensics you
looking at the information in america

672
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,840
gonna switch me and here first

673
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,840
to bear with me for just a second on

674
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,510
because I wanna bring you get into it
secondary bien that I have where we

675
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,970
typically do our

676
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,760
some deal and we do our security
analysis

677
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,700
so in just a second to switch over here

678
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,710
okay so I'm gonna show you

679
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,820
what it looks like more from a on if you
wrap unduly around eight if you get

680
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,100
tired of doing the

681
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,290
I'm and you now

682
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,680
it by hand made Michael Amir

683
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,680
in and why do that when we come back to
my side

684
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,330
real quick but I brings up and running
so basically what I'll show you here

685
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,030
today

686
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,360
you can do the things by hand i doing a
TV poll

687
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,220
on by doing man in the middle and
routing and network traffic in a 3-2 in

688
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,940
just a minute on them our side

689
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,700
on what what we've done it again we've
taken those things and we wrapped him in

690
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,420
a pie DTK interface

691
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,690
make it really easy to just pulled on
the artifact examine and

692
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,220
look at the information is really the
fact that way for me to show you the

693
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,040
data

694
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,140
on and then we spit out a report and we
basically day

695
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,840
pay you know what information did you
find you know where is it located

696
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,300
on you know input although artifact on
in all that data kinda at your

697
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,260
fingertips

698
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,860
and need to bring it up real quick I
already did

699
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,560
the night thing I like about this is
that don king and conferences

700
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,430
and I'll literally just pull up a nap in
in 10 minutes you can rip through

701
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,650
security audit

702
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,810
and make it really easy to come through
so for these guys

703
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,260
you know we found username/password in
the keyword

704
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,480
on a few doing to grab by hand you can
come down here and basically

705
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,440
he where he to the files are located so
we found the username

706
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,220
the appendix past in the databases data
directory

707
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,580
the pastor was there as well at where
the different keywords

708
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,760
and immediately on the keyword point gap
well

709
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,710
skirt capturing and

710
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,350
P cap on the network here

711
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,360
and we bring things up and acted with
forensics people you can be

712
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,610
string but you can easily come in here
just like Wireshark want that out

713
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,080
in because it we found in ATP you can go
through the HTTP traffic

714
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,980
really quick on and then start looking
at you know what

715
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,000
information are they sending back and
forth in plane tac

716
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,710
and you end up finding that pretty much
all the data passing around

717
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,690
is intercept the ball and tell by
looking at the forensic data

718
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,020
by looking at the you know the
application data

719
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,620
you can me on how the app is is creating

720
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,960
you both static and dynamic analysis I'm
here

721
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,110
in the forensic review you can see they
have abated drug database called data

722
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,220
and they have a journal file as well the
journal file

723
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,740
are where people like catches the data

724
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,930
and I'm gonna do a quick strings on it
when you look at that the journal file

725
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,610
on you end up finding they did people
like this book right ahead login journal

726
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,300
file

727
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,640
became burning right dated to the death
so they don't move in case you lose your

728
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,880
power and I think they converted and
eventually right back to think like

729
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,870
database

730
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,980
so in here you line up financing Journal
files

731
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,010
are tracking all the information until
you are looking at your own app

732
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,330
for your own company take a look because
you may say hey

733
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,610
we're always ROM you know writing data
but they do leading it never stored on

734
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,860
the device but that's not going to be
the case

735
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,770
typically will recover the state a
journal file that your other techniques

736
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,500
infill they were storing all the
information in the actual data directory

737
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,810
an answer in the database

738
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,990
called call data on your preferences

739
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,170
flag and

740
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,040
don't ski

741
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,440
I'm you put through here at the bottom
you'll end up seeing

742
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,530
here's your username your password
here's my to basics before encoded data

743
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,720
some cookies and strings and things of
that sort so

744
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,430
by pulling down the PCAT my point on the
friend to get you can you can simple

745
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,470
friend a Canon

746
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,550
in dynamic in out this I'm on any app
and you know you be doing it from

747
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,750
command line

748
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,320
and I just for their five minute I
thought I had till nine then

749
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,040
915 so let me let me switch back in our
analysis

750
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,190
I want to point out an interesting
anti-gay called NQ mobile

751
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,690
on it publicly traded company any buyer
is it based on to China

752
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,550
we did something out this onto could
Bloomberg after two and spoke to be an

753
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,480
anti-virus

754
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,560
on but it end up reading your contact
your SMS

755
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,430
on it read here IMEI am a tire install
that the website that you visited any

756
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,370
then into three different servers and
accused everything China in one server

757
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,970
and

758
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,710
on candidate every ticket and everything
board a plane tac

759
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,670
on in that one in a tiny servers they
tended ATS encrypt it but they bundle

760
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,000
the key with it

761
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,570
in any other want to do an act or with
your lactic

762
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,670
basically a encryption on

763
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,510
in the other thing to do that does it is
really surprising is that they actually

764
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,660
try to run at you on your device

765
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,920
if they can run issued a try to mount
your your system partition read/write

766
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm and then they are going to be at
business model where the fed him to fate

767
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,420
virus alert every time you run it after
about a 10-minute

768
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,570
so we ran it in an emulator with no
other app installed and lo and behold

769
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,120
they found you by riches on the emulator

770
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,200
I'm so you know why do I show you that
bad not now where

771
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,220
right because none of them our vendors
rapid and it had a legitimate company

772
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,060
and maybe they're just really bad colder
than the over permission

773
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,140
you know they're sending your data to
China and they did for gotten they

774
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,420
shouldn't be doing it but

775
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,990
you know what if this is a book that day
I'm a little bit concerned with that

776
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,130
so my point is that the next to dampen
within 14 not going to have much time to

777
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:26,840
go through

778
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,140
in a live demo are be the real peace in
our

779
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,770
leader wanted been downloaded up in our
list I'm bid to the Russian

780
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,370
malware targeting I they gonna die
downloader app

781
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:41,480
on it and advertising network and

782
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,570
we bundled cool calm arm AP k tool

783
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,010
it can allow you to reverse engineer the
app with a simple command

784
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,610
see you basically just run the command
right here AP Kate

785
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,590
to all I B and then you give it a name
to the AP k in the output directory

786
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,420
it can reverse engineer the app pull out
all the assets an artifact

787
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,760
taking in a directory and I get it look
at

788
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,010
again and I want them to think you can
do to congrat

789
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,140
and look through something so wanna
think they look at it

790
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,720
are they were quitting your device id:
because that competed in for making you

791
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,580
can then use trade impersonated device

792
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,990
download app this one registered on boot
complete

793
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,170
which mean if you need did the phone
finishes booting to go to register the

794
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,900
service and start doing things

795
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,540
and what do they end up doing they end
up I'm registering

796
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,370
on and cracking up an ad network

797
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,990
and and then basically make it so that
when you

798
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,800
Ron they can then a nother a PK

799
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,650
to your SD card and have you installed
at a PK

800
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,590
on basically from a weapon for their
gonna sideload other malicious app

801
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,740
onto your on onto your device

802
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,500
and you can basically get to the bottom
of this by looking at them in the code

803
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,380
and if you don't want to do a
command-line you can run something

804
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,650
called I Dexter Jr

805
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:07,650
on and let me he if I key and

806
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,630
ski

807
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,760
and I know I'm gonna run outta time here
so on

808
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,130
there's a command contact the GRT
basically take

809
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,910
any AP Cape while you run back to GR and
can create a jar file

810
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,610
and then you can open it up with a on
illegally go to uphold

811
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,270
sitting on on I think a clinic and ready
for you

812
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,360
in reverse engineer that enlarge it
again in the code

813
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,950
on in and in a very readable way on and
this is where he

814
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,080
here you can see that there's an install
method on

815
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,670
they actually install the file on at
down

816
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,230
school or did you download it from the
internet

817
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,770
David here at the card in a tide load at
ATK file

818
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,070
I'm more interestingly I'm we get a
degree in banking now where we know with

819
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,290
the cream banking malware

820
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,190
until we start looking at they add
Android app for ZIP file

821
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,110
an infected file you can do things to
confuse the reverse engineering to also

822
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,500
the first thing you guide started
getting good gameplay

823
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,970
on it and it popped and he didn't get
fired

824
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,710
Android ignored that instill granted a
valid AP K

825
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,090
but all the other two with that used it
on the pit and you there now

826
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,300
got confused thought within cryptid and
then failed

827
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,660
so this is the way for them to try to
make I burden-sharing

828
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,190
tale my guide ended up putting out flag
back

829
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,840
on and what we ended up finding it added
on target to be used for banks the three

830
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,050
or four banks

831
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:39,490
on it install it tries to get around
reverse engineering to the encryption

832
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,110
flag

833
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,680
and then it registered with high
priority enters that

834
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,440
packages as they were installed and
uninstalled the reason is

835
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,380
they want to uninstall degree in banking
app anyone to reinstall a Trojan version

836
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,580
so you'll never notice a difference so
they look for those guys

837
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,850
the uninstall it and reinstall it and
then one thing done at the Interceptor

838
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,960
at them at

839
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,140
on they ended up running of the LAMP
server that had a lot of own abilities

840
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,440
on hello so some guy who went out there
and

841
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,630
you know popular third got shell on a
dunk other data

842
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,720
you know Terry better a but on bandit
have you're registering content

843
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,080
providers an SMS receiver did that with
their command-and-control

844
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,720
so I'm last part got here outgunned on a
Web site

845
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,370
you to come and get you to work in the
air to get a dynamic an outfit

846
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,640
from the man in the middle traffic on me
it would be a donor

847
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,900
on a product that free on you install it
on your Android phone and it begins to

848
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,950
profile the apt and what I P

849
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:37,960
imports they're talking to anything that
thirty you think about looking at your

850
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,280
organization anything

851
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,609
hey what apurate and be looking at on

852
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,880
you might want to take a look at a
technique like that could you can be

853
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,120
profiling your devices in real time

854
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,410
in basically saying hey what apt what
ports what servers where they located

855
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,330
who sending data to them

856
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:57,220
and then you can begin to pay what are
the app that I want to start looking at

857
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,480
so I know I'm on it I'm here I'm really
sorry that the

858
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,020
that Iran ran late and it did you know
from the interesting stuff

859
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,440
santoku enacted an open-source the tools
are all bundled

860
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,550
on we don't get a lot helping the
industry that's fine I don't we've got

861
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,930
open for tours we don't have them out
very much too but if you are interested

862
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,020
we're always looking for how to we're
looking for people who contributed to

863
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,270
live in development

864
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,359
are giving them advice and feedback so
you know contacted online

865
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:26,740
give it a shot on Twitter whatever on
and I would love to hear from you guys

866
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,530
so thanks for your time today
