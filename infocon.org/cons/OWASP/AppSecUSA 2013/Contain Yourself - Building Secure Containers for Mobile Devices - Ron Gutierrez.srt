1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,120
think and when I thank everyone for
coming here today and I clearly in the

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,710
morning

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,340
up to you wake up and make it to the
park thanks for everyone to get here in

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,800
time

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,720
I'm my name's Ron Caron network for got
them they do fine

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,130
I'm where application security company
much to of thing

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,460
security is talk

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,880
is in be talking about secure container
and primarily in the Iowa

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,350
world so we can talk a lot about like I
i

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,309
confab for building the viola your
container some

11
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:38,450
not going to be I'm i won a guy last 11

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,750
kinda presentation say it kinda thing
that you have

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,340
I P knowledge of my life and try to
build on top of that

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,680
the

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,039
just a quick outline the talk working in
talk about you know what are they

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,059
year compared to the free by topic let
that a fine one to secure container it

17
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:58,710
and work

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,750
after that and again into how commercial
solutions out there another homegrown

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,089
solutions are actually

20
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,219
developing these your container talk
about them

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,049
authentication design patterns in data
encryption best practices a tapping the

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,529
strength in a secure container

23
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:18,119
you here to take a nap there solution
are you want to build your own

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,139
how do you determine how good it is and
where some limitation

25
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:26,560
available in Iowa that can limit I'm how
effective a secure container can

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,270
actually be

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,389
I'm sure most of you have heard the

28
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:35,409
at the convent the be

29
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:40,189
BYOD bring your own device a lot of
enterprises are now embracing this Nikon

30
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,700
that and if you're not familiar with the
concept is that

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,619
are you can now use them it on a bike
and now organization providing you with

32
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,889
the device you can now use your own
personal life

33
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:53,149
to access company resources I'm unlike

34
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:56,859
a man is tonight you know company no
longer have the ability to import

35
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,209
policies on you

36
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:02,700
nowhere did BYOD

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,999
come from I'm eventually you know back
in the old days

38
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,160
blackberry we think that the fact that
the bike that

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,200
organization pat has a bad I'm way for
adoring

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,219
they have actually manage parties on a
bike ride a bike and

41
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,969
excellent opportunity that ample and
like times for grad more and more like

42
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:24,430
other time cell phone cut people started
having my phone

43
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,620
on them all the time then are impatient
re-thinking

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,299
wire we having our employees carry
around two devices all the time

45
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,780
you know they have a perfectly capable
device already why not to

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,390
have them you that one and set up you
know ending re

47
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,540
company restarted buying the BlackBerry
buying that

48
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,980
their bf ever actually manage the happen
ain't that a cost-saving measure it

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,709
they've actually

50
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,299
9 a.m. break this BYOD approach

51
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:55,680
after what is a secure container let's
actually define that

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,359
that the United gonna be a something
that provide

53
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,540
to be here security at the application
layer

54
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,340
and I can control the device policy I'm
gonna control

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,999
to carry an application where and
everything with an application I'm gonna

56
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:16,680
I am want all controller I'm can't rely
on any OS

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,599
security policy or are features even if
the divide

58
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,299
did not have a pass rates for example my
ap

59
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,099
secure container ship will be secure and

60
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,659
philomena import other I polished the as
I wish

61
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,209
the water coming from the big-name BYOD

62
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,310
solutions out there you my no heard from
anything good

63
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,969
the trick on this Nico now it is part of
the man tacking milk on a

64
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,139
we're gonna talk about nominee for the
same thing going to how they actually

65
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:47,739
work

66
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,870
and some some security issues have you
been countered in

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,069
family though

68
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,329
went again you know the main reason why

69
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,439
company's money are signing it look and
feel like

70
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,170
research for secure containers and Ethan
commercial solutions they want employees

71
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,879
to have acted

72
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,129
there dana all the time you know wanna

73
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,329
that like that idea my personal reading
is when I'm in the bathroom

74
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,420
I have my cell phone with me all the
time and their

75
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,009
the company like no my re not you know

76
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,940
we want them to have you be doing
company where on their personal devices

77
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,870
why not and enable at where the main

78
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,449
issues with unmanned tonight this and

79
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,599
the main riff here are unite I can
control that user from paying any

80
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,970
cattery and cutting a path reason I O
fórum maintain enable

81
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,139
dating protection and finna now familiar
with data protection

82
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,900
I am the main API that I last few

83
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,660
thank developers can leverage Jackie
protect data at rest

84
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,630
increase the data using a past three
that the right from the path can

85
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,740
antibody debuted on have a path

86
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,770
strong passcode or any pac can I'm

87
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,740
you nap the developers really have no
built-in solution actually

88
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,669
protect data being stored I went there
on their own encryption with

89
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,979
you know you don't have the on your
development and application

90
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:22,069
have to be that and hard I'm other
policy

91
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,949
accords are you know like remote wipe I
cannot manage that they might

92
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,940
when it gets lost this time how can I
trigger my wife

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,000
and running on it you know broken by you
know when

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,699
you're running and jailbroken device on
the built-in IR security feature

95
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,810
no longer exist no the bigger curious

96
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,199
talk now be a little more technical and
figure out how the

97
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,240
container actually work I'm the leverage
something

98
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,509
concept called application wrapping and
what this

99
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,770
and it actually does is you have an
existing app

100
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,930
a developer has created it already I
wanna

101
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,759
rapid and make it more secure it can
actually intact functionality

102
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,819
new functionality into an existing
application and if the functionalities

103
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,060
gonna be used to add

104
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,560
encryption at rat and authentication

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,379
and important any honey any other policy
they really wanted them

106
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,819
and wanna keeping their I never have to
have access to the code

107
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,710
and I don't want to have acted account
but if an active account

108
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,780
actoplus of Islam and I think require
and

109
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,210
require any changes to the code

110
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,210
though the very high level diagram

111
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,479
spending a lap wrapping work you know
organization

112
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,520
you know they say all right that's a
lotta good at out there

113
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,460
on the App Store you know I am a mailbox
application I want them to you that you

114
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,629
read them out

115
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:49,039
I want mp3 inot ap creation to

116
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,069
weepy eat meat and edit PDF file there's
a doc

117
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:56,900
to go application to read and edit for
document without having to worry about

118
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,330
are these applications secure highly
storing data I can import

119
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,120
medication on these things I don't want
them reading my

120
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,289
tentative company resource this from
these application

121
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:12,150
I'm can actually rap 'em and in store
and forth my the party that i won

122
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,860
and in and it on a brand-new very
cinematic this thing ap

123
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,110
that actually secure an unmarked am

124
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,110
let's look into have the tracks cloud
gateway

125
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,990
they which is there to care App Store
basically

126
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,449
the way down from a high level the way
it works is you have

127
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,520
an IPA file have an existing application
you

128
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,090
you install this app wrapping at all
software on your

129
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,479
your Mac Mac welcome whenever am in an

130
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,069
except IPA power something new
distribution I like distribution

131
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,419
certificate

132
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,030
and then if it on a brand-new IPA power
very

133
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,699
Xtina magic analogy actually analyzed

134
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,099
before and the after and find out when
in fact needs changing and had a beer

135
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,659
you can the first step we did was I'm

136
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,879
it at that the two actual binary
executable

137
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,069
an immediate access on them I'm

138
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,289
and value pack being with them 320 out
there

139
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,840
and meeting their this kinda highlighted
what in the binary with actually

140
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,169
modified

141
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,479
and determine where what what address

142
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,599
of that in that binary with actual
change obviously the

143
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,729
tax is not very user-friendly very
readable

144
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,490
I'm the Wii and executed was actually
run in Iowa

145
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,160
and Mac OS Panizza ma ko beautiful I
might be familiar like elf excusable

146
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,880
there P executed well

147
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,000
is it just that I last heard the 1i OS
runs

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,170
so you can just pop this on you know I
ma Kai two people have a defined

149
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,150
define formatting that have pop it into
a tool called my coby that have come out

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,680
outlays that actual formatting
undetectable

151
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,610
in the nineteen readable format and then
I hone in on where

152
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,770
well and actually added and the
resulting

153
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,000
execute a ble and was actually injected
into it whether

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,320
al the load and dynamic library so what
it is doing

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,770
it's actually telling injected into the
existing

156
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,060
application thing how even now loaded

157
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,750
this dynamic library as well money from
when and and read run

158
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,060
iMac injecting code at that point I'm

159
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,580
and when we look to see where dynamic by
Maria

160
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,270
it was pointing to a new and actually
injected called the thanks

161
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,830
at the track that Thailand with its head
just packaged

162
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,890
I'm alongside with the back and binary
in the fame IPA file

163
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,940
next thing that changed in there in

164
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,450
executable ways because signature which
is what we expected

165
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,850
you get in Iowa everything have to be
signed in order to run properly

166
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,590
I'm node you and I mentioned earlier at
Best Buy distribution certificate

167
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,860
as well battery find the application for
Mac can actually run

168
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,910
and by some

169
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,100
and that make then though another thing
to keep in mind that the

170
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,410
when you're committing to the App Store
you can actually

171
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,530
you dynamic library to band I'm

172
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,850
so you can only ever really these rap
applications within

173
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,010
internal like enterprise application
stores

174
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,170
so ninety sign in with your own
distribution certificates you can pull

175
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,350
that off

176
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,230
me that get into I now have code
execution in this manner and act in my

177
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,540
dynamic primary

178
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,540
how are they overriding functionality
built into that apt

179
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,850
you know this Docs to Go application is
you know you're heading Word document

180
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,170
saving up to the bout them on that the
night

181
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,690
how is this dynamic library actually
changing

182
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,270
that implementation of the Papa them
right and to think Epson

183
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,710
though technique called methods
withering I'm

184
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,240
and if you're familiar with Micah I left
hacking her jailbreak development you

185
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,380
might have heard the Vikes

186
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,720
mobile substrate weeks we thank script
I'm the kinda do the same

187
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,160
same thing and behind the scenes there
are two leveraging meant this was going

188
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,840
to take me

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,450
5 Dec 15

190
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,530
let's look at the application life-cycle
for Iowa

191
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,310
you know you install an app you wanna
run it you click the art icon

192
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,580
and then call the UI application main

193
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,780
application maintain Act provides you
with an application delegate

194
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,390
every which is a protocol every thing
all I like that

195
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,640
have to define their own application
delegate

196
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,120
and this is just gonna contain a punter

197
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,220
method they get triggered a pond event
moved

198
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,600
them think it's triggered when you start
in apt is the

199
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,830
application did finish launching option

200
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,220
this is when the first thing that gets
executed

201
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,880
when you start a nap this is the first
is unlike the most interesting place

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
actually start

203
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,610
are our interaction you wanna try to
resolve this matter and change the

204
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,680
implementation to everyone

205
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,860
not only do that you know how do I how
many injecting into

206
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,980
something and thank you that early in
the life cycle

207
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,780
I'm getting the method abject have this
youthful

208
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,480
on method called Mon and will own eyes

209
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,940
is the moment that and that library
actually

210
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,130
get and executed intellectually when the

211
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,540
code and everything object within as
long as it's implemented

212
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,360
so you can buy can control aimed at the
library

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,660
as long as I implement loan I can then

214
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,050
intact and even earlier in the
application life-cycle

215
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,810
and do whatever I need to do I wanna
play application did finish one thing I

216
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,890
can replace it

217
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,660
with whatever I want

218
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,160
that the feeling is that the DNA the
three function call

219
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,320
start off with a original you wanna get
the

220
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,510
and read the original method so you be
called choir

221
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,280
on this car getting through this method
first parameter

222
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,640
object that you wanna play and the the
method as well

223
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,650
and any but by the method that you
created that you can replace that way

224
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,820
and then lastly you have method exchange
implementations

225
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,870
no I really don't need a flop the
implementation

226
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,570
now in the App the tactic in the world
educating the original one

227
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,800
text educating my code instead and then
when my co decide

228
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,130
I run the original and is gonna run my
fell and its gonna run the original

229
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,560
behind the things

230
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,840
yet by Kyle little and manager intact

231
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,690
right before the the original method

232
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,890
I can do whatever cut i1 here and then
discard the original for the app doesn't

233
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,990
break

234
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,770
in night though for downloads that can
show you

235
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,130
PO the for method for doing I'm

236
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,190
that they organization has bunten
application

237
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm sayin example of how to create a fat
dick library

238
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,550
you know you have the code when in fact
that you can take the static library

239
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,640
will link it with your existing
application for an economy make it more

240
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,140
secure

241
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,590
hospital well literally like a model PSP

242
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:20,290
Iraqi people and I'm

243
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,390
hearing have a nothing banking
application

244
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,410
have own definition and application did
finish launching

245
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,760
great the and where I one actually start
injecting

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,210
we run the application in a typical
banking application right

247
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,490
you know that the typical function that
a a typical banking Apple

248
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,370
would pull off in our goal is

249
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,490
I wanna replace the functionality of
application the finish line thing which

250
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,010
is showing the you I

251
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,910
an intact login screen right before it
actually went

252
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,740
now I switched to the code the library
time creating

253
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,900
you can wanna the main

254
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,070
you know not come to training camp in
cana film

255
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,810
for them first issue is how did mine
static library code

256
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,200
which doesn't know that in %uh that have
any idea that the name in the car

257
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,220
the name your application delegate how
my purpose for the late without knowing

258
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,360
the name first

259
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,500
the first thing you have to deal with
retrieve a list

260
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,220
I'm all the classes I am available in
the executing

261
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,630
programs and after that OBS copy crime
with that

262
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,170
an NRA you are the classes and as I
mentioned earlier

263
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,440
every single app delegate have to follow
protocol

264
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,170
I've a UI application delegate I'd with
simple if they manifest that this class

265
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,200
conform

266
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,220
to the UI application delegate if yet

267
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,150
I'm probably found the wreck on and I
want to thank for going

268
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,430
my pan at choir and the exactly how I
showed you before

269
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,920
I start I did the method exchange
implementation I now flop

270
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,920
implementation at this point I'm my
flanneled

271
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,810
method which is right there it has been
added is that on the original

272
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,630
you control it ain't no in my login
controller I can do whatever logic

273
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:15,630
I wanted them at this point I'm eaten

274
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,070
though I can swivel now what on to the
PO

275
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,310
the sewing how to easily start
implementing your on

276
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,610
United not doing anything purity be
dismantled that by

277
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,770
now you have code execution Internap
looking down

278
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,370
you know and in your own FL
authentication here at you have a lead

279
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,930
apt

280
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,260
in your organization wanted to have a
library that

281
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,400
they can use to actually even display in
plain take and the authentication for

282
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,130
you

283
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,510
are wanna you wanna at Bain & data
storage encryption

284
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,810
the only have to do with wendell the
implementation you like on the part that

285
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,520
them right

286
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,390
he collided base right I'm don't know
porn an ad

287
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,630
security that way and apparently the

288
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,770
market the fact typing based on all the
BYOD positions out there

289
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,419
people are doing it and actually filling
it out to make a

290
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:07,600
might profit little

291
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,889
get into

292
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:14,350
up in kitchen design pattern and then

293
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,209
if your gonna add data encryption to an
application you know howard

294
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,949
than he being generated to actually
protect the data

295
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,819
and I think that that the main thing you
have to worry about when you're

296
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,159
developing secure containers you know
you're adding data encryption

297
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:33,429
but make how is that Inc and encryption
actually implemented by passable make

298
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:36,860
in the only way to every implement
proper encryption within an eyelash

299
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,559
nap is you have to have some sort of
authentication to retrieve iraqi value

300
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,450
them principle to live by when
developing secure containers are

301
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,730
and data stored in app my all be

302
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,580
a $50 monthly strengthen the crypto can
never rely on any device policies but

303
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,850
whoever

304
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,320
and the crypto keys must be achieved the
pontiff that's what medication you can

305
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,110
never be able to achieve a key

306
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,669
without earlier indicating to the apt

307
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,940
Utne deleted authentication design in a
solution out there

308
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,200
it is broken by design no question that

309
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,929
I'm during a crypto key and I broken

310
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,919
some crypto key arrived at a the entire
key derivation material stored

311
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,370
and different places on into my buying
the dollar T Mobile gonna be broken

312
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,509
home and data storage not protected by
ap

313
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:32,470
on thank you can pass can d'amato need
to actually

314
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,190
vindicate once again get back he there
it can be broken

315
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,590
the reason why all these are broken and
unit that sleeping Dana

316
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,919
during the key right next to me
real-life scenario

317
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,250
I by tonight Spain the you know lockpick

318
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,929
proof lock and then I starkey anthony my
fire pot

319
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,590
got beat is no longer gonna try to break
this unthinkable lock

320
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,309
you can just look for the key that than
anything to up going right the front

321
00:18:59,309 --> 00:18:59,990
door

322
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,980
I'm and security in the in this scenario

323
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,779
why am I trying to break anything AF
encryption and Mike

324
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,480
the real girl who goal here is to
actually to reverse engineer the app

325
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,830
between the key and to get going or

326
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,320
bypass logic in the app they are you
show me login screen

327
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,409
that's great I was gonna buy path and
you have any way

328
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:26,759
in good look at an example have an app
that

329
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,049
now has a mock hackers screen but Adam
actually protected data

330
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,519
derived from the past three I'm so I is
the

331
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,740
meant application a to whole post on my
credit card info

332
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,250
between axonal push alerts and whatnot
had that Michael

333
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,519
feature to use data have good pincode on
it

334
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,230
now they are cool and I needed them out
here I kinda

335
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,309
spent some time to bypass a anatomy
pretty easy

336
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,779
I am

337
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,799
let's go to do it that by that burn show
you how easy it through america nap

338
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,299
you know you might think I like it hard
to remember not really sexy pretty

339
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,440
simple

340
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,610
something at the mint app from that App
Store

341
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,440
I think rapid great that a lot of cold
out there that can be kept it easily

342
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,289
now use clutch be corrupted by 9i wanna
know

343
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:19,480
what are the what are all the method

344
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,009
that are being called in the apt II talk
all class stamp or any bride-to-be

345
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,350
I'm print out on my floor thing
everything i'm Jack and

346
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,629
method within that great I am I looking
for now

347
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:36,080
I wanna know what function is called
after that Pinkel lockscreen

348
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,809
after I enter the correct PIN code are
unknown but

349
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,279
method vacuuming car to trigger the UI
to change

350
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,240
see the actual ap that that my result
single

351
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,279
here to clap them output you there's

352
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,100
to a month for them at Delhi in a you
didn't the first place you like

353
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,679
that turning point right I got
misdemeanor domestic call them right

354
00:20:58,679 --> 00:20:59,340
away

355
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,649
I 1 a.m. that out an hour that pop away

356
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:06,159
pasqua great that the promising so

357
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,929
I go to the next my next app I wanna
know when did that

358
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,429
hop away pasqua being called by the apt
are now the

359
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,610
in the back to being triggered want to
answer proper passcode

360
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,980
though the quick way to do that is
leverage does knowing

361
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,740
but this time from an attacking fam
point-man in a protecting them point

362
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,629
and to do that we leverage mobile
substrate I'm and the field

363
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:31,710
a marked with allowed to do quick and
dirty Buckingham any function you want

364
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,960
into you know be lying function sorry
implement them anyway US

365
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,799
this requires no broken device by

366
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,070
it but how easy it is to write a ps3

367
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,450
takes about five minutes all you really
need to do it by

368
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,600
Denmark what object I wanna rip

369
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,529
and cock into him and industry implement
any method with and i won

370
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,960
now you know I don't need having a month
to any of them leave right now

371
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,049
and I'm ready trying to replace and
figure out how to

372
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:06,710
application actually works now I thought
of it pop away with packard which is

373
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,149
when I'm interested in I do percent log
with just that

374
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,870
monitor console when the code actually
run man duper

375
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,950
venerated with that run the original
code when

376
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,289
20 live it to the console Apple work
that way

377
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:26,840
expected to work I didn't know now I
look at the comp no one actually runs

378
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,749
the gonna quit them out this in action

379
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:35,320
I'm is another tool caught by skipper
time can actually you

380
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,110
here too show their I'm nice get an
interpreter

381
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,929
kinda to let that the Cana I'm method
packing

382
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,769
I am and give the command line interface
and really interesting thing about

383
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,309
vice-captain

384
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,429
in a logical call any code within an app

385
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,999
anytime you want I'm even know perhaps
running and in the lockscreen I could

386
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:01,070
call anything on mine comes in college
and that happened I

387
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,980
the pit and not talk about why that's
important in a bit

388
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,360
I'm running the app on an airplane going
on my laptop

389
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,669
i'd I A got had lock screen setup well

390
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,269
iPad moxie that alright great

391
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,720
know I have an epic Bates prompt going
into my device

392
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,019
and over again and is going to bypass it

393
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,909
first thing you do with I skated
required for proper baby have been

394
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:25,740
running meant that

395
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,830
cited to appear the a an to get that
value

396
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,289
and Iran nice kept again and I'm
interpreter it's just

397
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:38,840
that already injected into them meant
application

398
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,940
right and got my interpreter they
mentioned earlier

399
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,049
that Golla app delegate the function
wanna start looking

400
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,350
I'm gonna create object from the command
line I can call anything

401
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,759
within because I now into executed and I
wish

402
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,389
I'm gonna call I am this year controller
compound there and I figured out

403
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:00,600
that actually return be callable da
lapaglia

404
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,730
I'm I create a variable with that

405
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,690
and then I call just call a method
called Papa a passcode

406
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,399
and ideally you know my theory with what
right

407
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,309
the pop Paschal just disappear and I can
diffuse the

408
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:18,740
application and I wish so let

409
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,899
take that back in when air and

410
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:25,649
men doesn't do any any different
encryption negative attack is from

411
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:29,059
number away might help this way you
that's important the

412
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:32,499
the higher-level concept that when it
was doing

413
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:36,009
encryption I'm it it broke windows

414
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,080
printable the program by design
principles and he was like

415
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,419
going everywhere you know the developer
thought they were super slick and maybe

416
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:42,950
like

417
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,210
I'm gonna create a key by doing shot TPB

418
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,289
a confection on a device ID and for men
in value here and then

419
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,990
at the end and a that doesn't matter I'm
ample

420
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,350
execution burly within the app in a book
if you have a method called generate

421
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,649
have greater get

422
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:03,980
get encryption key I could've called and
in nineteen encryption key and I really

423
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,860
need to know how that implemented behind

424
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,059
bean back in the car the method that the
returns it to you straight up

425
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,679
you can

426
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,080
I am again to some authentication
designed

427
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,139
gets a little tricky how to implement
proper authentication when

428
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:26,759
in you wanna support both online and
offline access

429
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,779
anyone online :-dd you gonna

430
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,440
connect Yoona company k2 about ever you
know that everyone knows

431
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,830
how to do that hopefully Manuel you can
retrieve an encryption key from the

432
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:42,299
I might there on in mind that good cuz
you can import

433
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,899
verified power these lockout and all
that and make them they can secure

434
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:50,269
now when we get to offline access you
still want employees to have access to

435
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,360
the patty their

436
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,860
file while they're in the train station
or you know number of mine

437
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,409
too many to implement away an empty
building crypt pick-up that they never

438
00:25:59,409 --> 00:25:59,990
teaneck

439
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,369
he even though they don't have internet
access I'm a net

440
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:06,749
Inc and introduces them some issues

441
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:10,679
you can I am though

442
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,110
the way you can pull it off its kinda
MIT how disk encryption work

443
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,830
you have a master key in any that have
other key that encrypts that matter can

444
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,259
protect it

445
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:24,090
lani making access to the master key is
by medicating

446
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,710
using wanna the value we generate a
master key

447
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,460
upon initial startup this matter key is
the thing

448
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,860
actually build a Inc encryption and
decryption Obama

449
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,039
a different by and then

450
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,509
top-line passphrase you pass it through
key derivation function

451
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,460
in generation of binding corruption key
and that encryption key then you

452
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,129
to actually an actor in a master
encryption key

453
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:53,320
something improper or the on-line
encryption Mon example than a

454
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,419
arriving at locally arrive it from
server

455
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,169
what this an added benefit event that
they can have separate paths pattern

456
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,830
for on mining camps in any word for
offline someone

457
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,200
know how reported of mine and in fact
your your data available online

458
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,360
as well on

459
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,509
keeper networking up court that never
perfect thing

460
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,159
and mapping cursing here any other key
on the right

461
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,399
whether it of the someone memory

462
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,070
an encryption card retired though always
beware and have this

463
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,049
infected by security fashion

464
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:34,779
the winner the main common issues that
we've seen in our planning corruption

465
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,950
we keep key derivation function but I'm
sleepy people just

466
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,100
having a few hashing function and if you
marry I got the property line

467
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,840
I can eat that my ASP but in reality you
making enough capital to

468
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,350
with four I'm another in we recommend
PKD up to

469
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,100
the minimum I like 4,000 anything things
okay

470
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,210
mean being treated at the US based on
performance

471
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,460
and what that does it it the function
that someone slonimsky

472
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,230
to generate think Ricky make top-line
brute forcing a lot harder

473
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,419
um the another real-world example this
was found in a

474
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,489
after Indian about military took from
the App Store

475
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,860
I am now getting the name have a game in
acting

476
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,200
may lawyer letter I'm

477
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,610
the way this asked already but anyway
onto the passer boire

478
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,860
you know you store can I keep at it here
you're familiar with the

479
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,860
he pattern are your hours like the
password

480
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,029
your login credentials and you have a
master encryption

481
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:44,200
matter at a rate that protect on India

482
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,279
alright by me but I look at it that
interesting secure container

483
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,159
and if he had worked the Packard Bell on
vacation with

484
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,249
form you can be crap up in a familiar
with be crafted to flow hashing

485
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:55,929
algorithm

486
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:59,779
fairly resistant to offline before so
great how they often

487
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,940
be creeped out but is it really company
plug into an hasn't a FB

488
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,669
like I then applying this speaker pastor
actually

489
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,759
protect the data like how they doing
that

490
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,580
I'm on further investigation

491
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,940
is an Android app it from there think
that the family art read

492
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,049
I'm it turns out that

493
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:24,369
8 app on that mark indication they then
take the

494
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,519
high-tech passer pass a piss out to be
they function

495
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,549
and created that the p-value there

496
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,840
what the meanest here you know your you
think he's B crib

497
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,580
to protect a passphrase I me as an
attacker

498
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,610
I no longer have care about the speaker
I can report that snapped the pic that

499
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,929
we're using a turkey

500
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,639
and beaker

501
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,940
but look at the time comparison PKD up
to

502
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,559
it I got to bed I did thank you now then
massive this time it how long it takes

503
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:55,879
to

504
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:01,499
January 2000 hasher's I am BB Kenny
f/2.8 point out in a thick take

505
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,940
319 back in few run a thousand hashes

506
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,509
top to keep you think i'd now take

507
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,710
point dear 01 back in

508
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,090
and then in order to exploit this
vulnerability I would need to do a top

509
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,879
to be fixed to generate the key

510
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:20,860
and India a hefty craft keeping about a
FB craft

511
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,379
it aid it a bill designed to be fat your

512
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:28,200
the main permit the AF to be fast and
secure know that

513
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,789
and he can't beat bill pay very minimal
time to actually do in a FB Chris along

514
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:37,299
with us out to be sick

515
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:40,389
so let's look at the completeness a man
implementation

516
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:43,940
you you have a position at their you
know Dave

517
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,610
tried taking into consideration and
writing to the path

518
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,919
down nikolai databases something big
really common API

519
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:54,249
the word them something they need to be
aware there's a lot of tunnel

520
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:58,210
OS features that cash to my nap be very
straightforward

521
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,419
a you should also be trying to fuck and
protect

522
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:05,350
Anani the company examples I like cookie
storage

523
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,659
I'm caches from you request on tax
document interaction PPI would come

524
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:14,379
into further I left naps I think we were
catching

525
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:18,119
on board a keychain dinner should I be
her kinky teen aid as well

526
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,169
yeah court one in the main feature them
the main

527
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:24,889
principle thing mentioned earlier they
should never rely on security feature

528
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:29,009
and only make eating dinner actually
really protected is that data protection

529
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:29,669
for naming

530
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,649
and data protection only enable it and
I'll hurt you that enable a

531
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:36,700
an art now in that might have a
passphrase

532
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,379
that on it and I think the key keep a
look out for our part names

533
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,049
it's about being crafted him

534
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:48,529
bill let's look into document
interaction PPI

535
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:51,749
I'm high-level over deliver a bit

536
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:54,830
is I am I encountered any

537
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,309
I left app can register to handle a file
wild-type

538
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:02,989
but they you're good for an upright they
say I one hand of PDF file

539
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:07,529
though whenever you open up a PDF file
and I'll at you get the title track down

540
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,489
the fence open and

541
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:13,499
need to pay cardiac from on only after
fainting can handle it

542
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:16,989
the GFB actually implemented a I am

543
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:20,399
handler I'll that allows it to you

544
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,629
to write to the GOP secure container for
an incomplete version a bit

545
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:32,470
or actually did have it emailed out to
corporate email community FB

546
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,480
has Acme interaction actually

547
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,999
work behind the scenes you know Howard

548
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:43,109
one application getting the file from
another app known that Miley

549
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:47,340
I life and mock in one app is never have
access to an app

550
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,690
I'm so behind the scenes with the I left
operating system that and actually make

551
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,809
a copy

552
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,259
on that file into the FB Fan box

553
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:01,059
and erected in a document that last
index for their

554
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:04,779
and it all happened Mary enough for me
down from

555
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,100
coding level they have no idea that
actually occurred a it now alright cool

556
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,989
have a file

557
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,989
me do what I need to do with it I'm
though

558
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:15,460
it turned out that this file disperse
this and in good for for

559
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,950
extended period time and it never
actually starting crafted

560
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,509
even at the FB has an incomplete version
apk file the pick-up emerging in like

561
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,179
the next

562
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:28,720
directory down

563
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,919
had an example from captain position he
countered

564
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,869
and added secure compare pretty well
developed the key thing when they forgot

565
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:38,029
about that

566
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:42,259
ACP cookie storied object so I've that
important

567
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,070
in observer amor that the persistent
cookie that cookie

568
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,419
get stored in plain fact kinda by in a
cookie that binary cookie file

569
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,769
I am and I'm the

570
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:57,379
turkey there someone important in the
web because they handle authentication

571
00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:00,999
you're storing like the the key to the
kingdom I think updated

572
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,929
I'm on YouTube you supposedly secure
container

573
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:08,389
now it didn't they never take that API
into consideration

574
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,910
whenever I datapipe was taken into by in
every move

575
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,929
and data as well

576
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,000
beaten again to the stretch from scratch

577
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,070
for the presentation well worth a
limitation

578
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,440
for containers you know I last had have
had

579
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
I'm issues where you can only run code

580
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,090
some Mollet active amana application in
the background

581
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:37,370
and apparently like determine I should
your remote reef that

582
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,060
viper something that there's really no
way for it to determine that

583
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,900
beaten combat I left them in actually
provided for new

584
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,190
background features to you help help
with that being

585
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,540
getting some new background mode it
capability

586
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,950
one in my background that's now
application that are running in the

587
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,600
background can do

588
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,660
periodic at it to the server and then

589
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,580
get responses back in and and runco to
get that this seems like an actual

590
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,390
night an area you actually implementing
a white

591
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,290
and you can have a nap you really have
to buy I want to feel connected to the

592
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:13,770
network

593
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,510
exit polling determine whether he might
there not

594
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,390
and even I am another approach that
wasn't added with remote notification

595
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,130
guy I built the on papa now you can
application

596
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,130
the way to work for it to get a remote
notification

597
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,220
ap can't run any code until user click

598
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,230
that notification and the app now

599
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,790
you going to happen notifications taxi
at the key data

600
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,290
upon receiving it which is found of them
on paper

601
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,250
the problem is is that really packed
airfield for like

602
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,610
application wrapping because I noted
government notification thingy

603
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,980
push notification server and everything
application need

604
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,170
to get personification two KVK

605
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,490
in order to actually have this I through
Apple incentivize

606
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,280
Larry you know

607
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,340
I am and you know

608
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,870
you leave here with one one key thing is
are kind by polity

609
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,030
can mean bypass our client side security
can be bypassed

610
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:22,040
I'm you know any power if you turn in
fourth policies on the right

611

615

store that somewhere I can change in

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,550

function as likely I'm

619
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,230
no keep there were SciTech I'm

620

keep policy enforcement verified it
possible

621
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,630
can only do that of course but if you
happen critical piece of code that you

622
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,650
want to try to protect

623
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,550
try to keep as well level possible
object if they have a show did before

624

superheated Arbor I'm just by dumping
out the cart path and fucking you can

625
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,690
do a lot of damage

626
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,560
how until break detection I'm most of
the stuff I said

627
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,410
today require think he'll bring canada
buy we can provide good jailbreak

628
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,010
action foreign secure container year
you're like

629
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,800
your new and a better place you where
and if you can

630
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,820
you now in Macon that much harder for
either actually

631
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,200
get any data and their I'm

632
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,170
so dat video had like this ap he's been
called ex-con which is a few to bypass

633
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,560
elbrick action if you like running like
HBO Go or something that it like I can

634
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,040
run that

635
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,260
I'm elbrick and you know people coming
down an ex-con it by pat it for you

636
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,480
a good path and simple want to be tested

637
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,180
can is this secure container emina by
Pat ex-con

638
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,880
don't break the pac-10 and not then it's
pretty bad

639
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,910
from and then you know

640
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,270
ideally want to this that taxonomy at
low level of possible

641
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,570
the most the lowest level a capacity go
with the family

642
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,640
and it is off until out there from the
guy who create

643
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,800
so-called new bit which is pretty
awesome

644
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,920
but if the tool like online Billy don't
go there

645
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,730
any playing click and actually generate
jailbreak the taxon

646
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,770
in AF am making a copy paste into any
function you want in your code

647
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,990
I may have to provide anti biking think
it can be attacked by their

648
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,390
GTB it's been attached to profit not
which is critical as well

649
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,240
on thanks for coming I'm comedy Genia

650
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,840
and then taking 2 p.m. question

651
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,920
untapped one bottle openers

652
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,790
next to the bar as well that only at
night on

653
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,310
Union by I'm gonna put the FIDE I'm get
high

654
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,520
unpalatable follow-up lakh per giving a
high-level overview

655
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,280
talking and on yeah

656
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,820
month on Twitter I don't treatments but
yeah

657
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:13,820
today thank you

658
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,780
Michael I feel I haven't really month
into

659
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,130
that too much on thing when it

660
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,370
main things is the protection plan by
default

661
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,450
but its Nana that the most secure way
could be

662
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,680
enable from make so any

663
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,200
not the way once before with any time
you add a file

664
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,960
in a and you have to and developer at
actually opt into you data protection

665
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,610
nyo effeminate now on by default but it
that you know pretty

666
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,680
not the best level protection you could
possibly do

667
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,730
by and it's better than nothing on and
it'll on a new function and we have in

668
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,290
mind

669
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,070
really like that is like airdrop has
been added perhaps can I like

670
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,160
and power other at on

671
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,570
but other than that and anything in
particular

672
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,710
you're looking for he chain management

673
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:23,710
daytime I like online keychain

674
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,609
that

675
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:35,869
well the in the main risk they were
trying to have waited

676
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,270
it you can't really protect the keychain

677
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,500
MIT have a passcode in life and

678
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,359
sure it's going to be crafted but at
that encryption key is not the right up

679
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,170
the path train

680
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,550
it when went to get into up on the

681
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,560
on the right that I ain't any pity
together

682
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,460
arrived back he and get access to data
when I want to have a pass rate I now

683
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,380
have additional security now

684
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,140
you don't actually get and brute force
my past three

685
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,829
in order to get access to that data that
there is a key difference

686
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:16,829
known

687
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:29,349
now be yen

688
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,730
no then she no they were where

689
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,839
on in terms of affecting it

690
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,430
I'm not sure yet I don't have a personal
copy and good unfortunately

691
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:50,810
and it'll found during a that mean
moments get deployment me

692
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,970
reported it in only kinda lot lost
communication over

693
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,230
after a while them can confirm whether
it yeah

694
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:05,230
in

695
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,359
bid the I would day

696
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,700
good good is pretty good

697
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,720
um II don't talk about

698
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,720
the other one that I'm you can

699
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,280
mmm

700
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,280
you

701
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,330
thing is

702
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,010
you can

703
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,300
you implemented the proper way let the
matter

704
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,560
your devices European because if you're
developing you take your container an

705
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,250
expert net

706
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,770
protecting data based on a path 3 here
now for three-and-a-half

707
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,590
guess know that path race in order to
you can access that data

708
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,680
it its for cases where it to ban
implementation

709
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,550
and they're just relying on the fact
that I'll the need to reverse engineer

710
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,530
the happy figure out how to actually get
my data

711
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,140
a relying on that at their main security
mechanism

712
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,350
I'm then that's when jailbreaking is
like I can be easily here's how

713
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,990
company be implementing the proper way
being jailbroken tune it really matter

714
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:39,990
you just feel like a defense and a print
you're right

715
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:50,099
mean mmm

716
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:19,020
in

717
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,440
yeah

718
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,730
your you're right and that point if you
have them

719
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,920
warm up now i running on a divide back
and left and

720
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,430
to stop that the current might like
entering a passphrase for example

721
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,710
your I don't think there's really
anything can

722
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:42,150
attack it up that I kinda recommend

723
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,160
you have some form of jailbreak action
and the better at it

724
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,590
the better off you are on in you don't
have that anyone allowed to have written

725
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,570
the right to kinda

726
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,310
your you have to accept that risk that
it code is gonna run

727
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,830
on the right in there is some form our
out there

728
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,620
for a life which at the moment I know
think it's very pretty and I'm

729
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,980
I'm either accept the rectory down when

730
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,150
if you find out nearly that good
creating our going around the prior

731
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,650
you might want to reconsider I'm your
approach at that point I'm

732
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:21,650
in

733
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,620
and an apple or

734
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:34,620
are at the Apple

735
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,870
I'm potentially the same I i did. you
know about an end to it would have been

736
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:51,300
two-hour presentation my night if they
quit mine and I like I went bad I think

737
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:51,870
with that

738
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,590
by it it then think that apply in terms
of like secure contains you can pretty

739
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,720
much do the same thing

740
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,340
I'm but from a developer standpoint it
in it

741
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,630
never have many like data protection EP
I think we could

742
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:10,310
particularly as I left has at approx I'm

743
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:14,310
but it I'm the

744
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,270
a little more that the 1 I'm our based
on a report out there

745
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:25,270
them keep that in mind

746
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,539
yeah and be

747
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:38,569
thank then running to the keychain you
get that data protection after view

748
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,309
remains about the thing you can think to
be the protection have to be some

749
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:46,920
they're they're opting in to you that
and that level of protection to you

750
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,970
how it's gonna be in cryptid in all data
on the device with

751
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,569
essentially pinpointed in completing a
divide p

752
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:57,869
and let me turn on the device and back
in memory table to be kept everything

753
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,369
with their protection does this and in
now in capping data using another key

754
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,240
that there I'm

755
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,390
on the past three you can only access
that data

756
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,289
20 unlock your phone at the highest and
the most secure mode

757
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,390
every time you lock your device in my
packing for memory

758
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:17,339
you now have to unlock it again to get
active that the net might provide

759
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:22,230
unlike developing and development issues
if you require

760
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,769
you know especially now famine if you
require your you some background

761
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:26,690
processing

762
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,970
on data and the device is locked are you
going to work

763
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,769
as expected yeah

764
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,720
yep we're different level yeah

765
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,970
that if he did that you have a developer
and you're trying to develop your own

766
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,039
apt data protection

767
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,049
the way to go if you wanna roll your own
crypto ca

768
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:52,109
go very wrong on

769
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:56,759
the keeping it simple keep in mind your
customers a protection going in to

770
00:47:56,759 --> 00:47:57,410
provide

771
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,970
its security if they have that cascade
I'm in them

772
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,920
might find it I might not find it me

773
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,420
yeah it by then these data protection
it's relying on a divide

774
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,950
have kidnapped the application casket
yes if you're using an application-level

775
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,079
past going to happen

776
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:23,079
in your own crypto at that point in time
yeah

777
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,289
if you want to have enterprise like MDM
for that you can enforce policies

778
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:30,430
underwriters and you're in a better

779
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,400
you can pay I all the things like that
happen have packard attacking at that

780
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,079
compatible complexity and then kinda
down the police

781
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,170
the this year secure containers you know
I really needed

782
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,630
you can enforcing policies anything like
that at that point in time
