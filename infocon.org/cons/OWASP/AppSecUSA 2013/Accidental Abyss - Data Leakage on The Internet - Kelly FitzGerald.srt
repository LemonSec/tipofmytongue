a bit

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,269
and what you can do and how you can
protect yourself from all the little

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,320
extra bits of information

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,599
on the Internet that are stored about
you and about your friend and your

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,369
family

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,970
and your coworker and your enemies and

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,039

keeping discrete math an ethical hacking
and that

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,869

like a really interactive

19
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,039
conversation so feel free to shout out I
also have

20
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:13,569
I doesn't sprinkle cupcake so if you
shot out with something really cool

21
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:16,999
there's a cupcake in your future and

22
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:21,229
my mother said bribery with the secret
to everything and

23
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,530
let me tell you about how the idea for
the talk was born

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,710
I travel a lot for work and

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm really mark so I like to think about
really important

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,490
stop good thing about being a and

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,920
and olive bad loans he engine really
important

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,579
love and okay not

29
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:47,259
no actually I was thinking about

30
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,969
alternative energy and better ways to
save the planet in you

31
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:55,179
the hand okay

32
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,849
no the truth is I'm really long plane
flight

33
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:03,939
i watch bad reality television so that
would be the Duggars the girl who have

34
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:05,939
an addiction to drinking nail polish

35
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,240
and that man who will be in effect that
why I'm

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,320
blacked-out advised but he's very cheap
and

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,740
good look at the guy who's she we're
gonna call Bob

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,470
met we learn that in a minute why in

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,310
and he's so cheap that he make this
family use a paper towel dispenser at

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,800
home so we can measure

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,190
how mitch paper towels they use he take
the family to a Chinese buffet like

42
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,390
six people in the only by to play and
the whole family

43
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,820
that on those really cheap high school

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,990
shares you know to keep to budget one
budget for the shows the family that

45
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,120
shows that they're barely scraping by

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,760
they're just like broke and then the
secret budget

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,840
which by the way the TV station also
showed

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,970
and Netflix also shows in

49
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,850
it had the Social Security numbers bank
account number his ID number at the

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,680
school district that he worked that

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,230
as well in so much other information
including a kid social security numbers

52
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,630
that I got

53
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,610
a little worried so that's why he's
blacked out but then

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,330
I did what I do neck and I wanted to see
what else I could find about this guy

55
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,290
cuz now I'm interested

56
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,080
and the thing I like to do with really
above-board rekon

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,120
find it looked interesting so by
watching the video I thought that he had

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,200
assured on

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,390
and it had been a member school so I
found out that it was a college

60
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,710
preparatory school

61
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,940
and it was a magnet school but he
founded

62
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,160
but graduated last class in 2011

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,280
and I also found out that he had a PHD

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,420
and other things I learned as they look
to the social security number

65
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,580
and has anybody ever dissolve help
social security numbers work

66
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,450
yeah there's a guy there be careful in

67
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,500
you have a cupcake if you want for doing
that but I am

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,400
anyway the first three digits or where
you were born to wear your card with the

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,950
fine-tuned

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,430
and then the middle to end up being
kinda room

71
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,800
numbers that increased slowly there's a
pattern to it

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,680
you can look it up on Wikipedia it's a
lot to explain

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,880
or you can look it up on in

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,590
I think it Social Security numerology
dot com

75
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,410
but here the list up all the social
security numbers in California

76
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,500
that's where I'm from and so

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,320
with unlikelihood you've taken out the
entropy other three digit

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,280
for somebody and so the fact that all
about social security numbers that I

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,420
thought on the spreadsheet

80
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,730
were california-based mean that and

81
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,180
Bob and his wife who were older

82
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,800
a you don't get your card at birth back
then

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,610
they lived in Oakland

84
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,200
at that time and then the kid ended up
being born in California because they

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,479
were

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,889
the right age so before 1986 you got it
around 14

87
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,480
that the whole I was thinking kinda
figure out somewhere my age

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,940
if you were a T 1690 you get it by about
5% in post

89
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,970
ninety just get it for so and

90
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,220
know what do we know we know it 14 bob
was living in California

91
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,760
both with children California and that
is cheap

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,370
the menu pokey owned like the people in
here

93
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,180
I love smokey Oakey only service they
actually pay for

94
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,870
a the things I like it tells me the home
address the

95
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,120
it give me at best get the email
addresses

96
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,070
give me best guess is that age and
property values

97
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,770
so I get a real good idea but what I
really enjoy Tokyo for

98
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,090
it gives me the business analytic that
credit card companies

99
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,840
that charities and other similar
companies use when they're trying to

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,160
target ads

101
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
so for bob smith this is what they think
they think that

102
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,090
he loves reading any has children in the
own pet the likes cars

103
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:11,090
I look myself up I love it by their
analytic they think I'm a boyhood

104
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,690
I'm getting this is because i buy all
the food in nerd book

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,510
and then by very analytic they also know
I like toy

106
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,199
so they they got that right and they
think I have children

107
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,060
but what they don't understand is that
although put her for me

108
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,120
so I really like the way babe analized

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,210
me because I'll be a conclusions they
come to a pretty wrong

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,840
but hopefully for bobbing you can check
yourself out

111
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,270
it may be true you can also up outta
Tokyo I'm buying more and more as they

112
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,430
go to innocently

113
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,220
third somebody just to learn more that

114
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,639
they've been removed in all I can find
out then is their name in their age

115
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,660
so I recommend doing that because

116
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,060
you know morning someone like me is
probably a good idea in

117
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,490
the best thing I can say is if you can
get somebody primary email you have

118
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,130
their goal

119
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,680
most about the probably had our primary
email

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,419
for 10-15 years and and we've got a lot
of

121
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,710
up with that email think about it now
and then you see the montage in your

122
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,460
head and it gets a little scary

123
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,120
and so if I can find that email and

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,660
are googling around and then start
looking at the fine on used for that

125
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,060
on eBay on Amazon on Facebook are
getting a lot of dirt and that's how I

126
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,310
really felt building the dopey a day

127
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,940
the Tokyo rebuild Bob email

128
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,370
Bob seven at gmail dot com that's not
the real one but

129
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,169
once again in protecting in though one
thing I learned was

130
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,060
Nora you like between the sheets by the
Isley Brothers

131
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,050
just look into that the ever met him
somewhere I would kinda know what kinda

132
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,060
music you like then we could have a
conversation

133
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,729
about that and you rock my world by
Michael Jackson

134
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,600
well so learn this that we kept mostly
this post

135
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,460
lot on Facebook he kept his profile
picture unlock

136
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,710
most people do I love that and he's very
proud about his donned

137
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,580
and I've also learned that by giving the
PQ few times if I think

138
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,870
check out the gun like half the men in
the room kinda

139
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,750
black so now I've learned how to
compliment a guy

140
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,060
and thank you Bob in

141
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,969
so when we see with bob smith is that he
had a major PIII leak through the courts

142
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,300
at the show

143
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,870
a in using just been really really
boring information I was able to get

144
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,789
more

145
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,010
I also found his eBay login and found
out that he had recently sold

146
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,310
the laptop in those laptops likely had
information from the magnet schools his

147
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,450
personal business

148
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,930
all that other stuff so now the Recon
trying to get a little weirder

149
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,720
also something interesting through e-bay
when you have time but when you buy

150
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,390
something on eBay and it gets in

151
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,520
you through Pay Pal and the label that
usually has your home address phone in

152
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,730
nope I really want to know for sure
where you live

153
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,350
I can buy one if your eBay auction and
you that the really good barometer

154
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,360
that's probably accurate in New and

155
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,600
FEMA declined that other stuff we were
doing was just playing around

156
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,940
and where do you use the school's killed
you them at work

157
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,870
you use them it dating and use them in
relating and

158
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,880
so birthing you Tokyo try to get the
primary email

159
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,570
you really want the primary email could
that person had it for ten or fifteen

160
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,529
years and I and god knows what with it

161
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,830
and go

162
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,320
Facebook yourself one thing you can find
on Facebook

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,910
and I find that sum up the apt do this
and some don't

164
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,790
they don't show your friends names in
alphabetical order

165
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,529
I have it on good information that it's
a 70/30 make

166
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,910
so when you look at your friend seventy
percent of those people are the people

167
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,670
who were talking you constantly

168
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,149
who are looking at your status is in
checking you out and 30 percent is

169
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:12,830
random noise and

170
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,529
so they could you good idea whose
looking at your profile

171
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:22,339
and also the time line summary and I
think I typed in from like Jane go

172
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,070
something Id I'm generic it possible the
sick people

173
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,440
they're all probably checking out your
face but quite a bit so if you want to

174
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,750
know who's checking you out

175
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,480
those are good indicators and being dot
com social will actually

176
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,930
search Facebook and Twitter so you can
search for your name where you can

177
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,860
search for posting concerts for things
by other people

178
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,470
in another similar app is open-book

179
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,410
I like this one too I haven't had a lot
to look when I try to

180
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,450
really dig in to try to find all the
open post

181
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,970
by a particular person but maybe they're
tweaking it as

182
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,890
time goes by well to be the really
interesting tools and

183
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,020
and then there's open that a third and I
don't have the right picture but it

184
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,270
similar thing and it searches people who
have not locked their status in

185
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,100
it's a good thing to check for yourself
is really wanna look on your status as

186
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,070
much as possible

187
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,670
the weekend people out like me from
looking

188
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,899
and has anyone used the wall from
outline

189
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,990
outputs of analytic tool in

190
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,740
interesting will propel to make
mathematical which

191
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,100
if you're a mathematician at like the
most favorite software on earth

192
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,020
you have dreams about you wanna cuddle
ed but they also made this analytic

193
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,270
for Facebook to you log in and then
again you lots of information

194
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,709
like your post from a a time line how
many words that was

195
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,580
what time you typically post other
things just inked up

196
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,160
know that really they've the world but
kinda fund

197
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,529
information is power we see this now
Facebook who

198
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,970
certain post to go into your feed you
don't get see everybody

199
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,620
most the time a someone commenting
regularly with being your feed

200
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,760
so if you want to keep think somebody
and opposed

201
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,790
you should comment on them when gazing
at your page regularly you're more

202
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,330
likely to see them in your feed and

203
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,089
the point where I like information they
were noted anything else interesting and

204
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:22,860
Facebook

205
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,339
in

206
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,380
okay and cupcake

207
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,300
and good for looking at strangers

208
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,709
a hunt for non friend to your heart
content

209
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,300
they will never know that your stocking
them or at least find out if your

210
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,700
Facebook

211
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,950
profile pictures are generally unlocked
and pictures are frequently unlock

212
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,140
but more so looking at the pictures is
looking behind the pictures

213
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,480
see what's going on to see what books
are in the foreground

214
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,610
that the what you might be in a
reflection in the window

215
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,279
you can gain a lot more information by
what was unintentionally

216
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,750
shown the maybe what with intentionally
minted be displayed

217
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,100
and so the a lot of ways that you can
kinda figure out more about a person

218
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,589
run blips are frequently on law to you

219
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,920
1 I've are these fiber guide here may
have been

220
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,980
bet hated locked up

221
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,670
Facebook on earth but unfortunately you
have to friend her mother it's like a

222
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,180
rule

223
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,250
somewhere and if your mother like mine
she comments on absolutely everything

224
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,930
and had almost no security lock

225
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,310
let me know anybody really trying to
check might very boring post about

226
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,480
security out

227
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,200
their own they're gonna need to do is
look at my mother's profile

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,230
and then start thing all the things she
commented on

229
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,790
because he doesn't believe anything from
coming into her T feed

230
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,630
and most people have someone like that a
chatterbox so if you can't

231
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,100
CD information in the person that you
want

232
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,829
a go looking through their friend and
likely you'll find

233
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:04,740
a chatterbox and that's what you need
somebody usually technically naive

234
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,579
who like to talk a lot and

235
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,089
date smarter so has anyone ever dated
online

236
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,490
and okay I've done a lot of it and like
a professional

237
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,560
one thing I noticed was a lot of people
put their full name

238
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,589
they're dating profile or their email
address the youth everywhere

239
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,700
and that kinda didn't seem like a great
idea

240
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,029
and then a lot of time you see pictures
you like not

241
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,240
like I had should I do so this guy
actually do

242
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,470
full name and it looked like a headshot
so I decided to

243
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,800
search for a min see what I could find

244
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,589
and their his Facebook page it was
pretty boring

245
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,880
and then I founded IMDB page and

246
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,829
he was in everybody's favorite movie
walk a mile in my product in

247
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:59,850
I know wanted I could have gone out with
the guy who walked a mile in my products

248
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,360
but I didn't

249
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
and a lot of people do that n anything
dating site the probably not

250
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,399
so bad okay I I had applied I don't
think that they did

251
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,490
it was from clown dating dot com I'm
think you're going to be more fringe

252
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,170
dating

253
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,360
night maybe you want to use the you
first

254
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,000
special name that you don't use anywhere
helping have it connected with

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,490
super special email you don't have
connected to anywhere else

256
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,880
and you pictures that you don't use
anywhere else

257
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,889
and can I is a piece of software tho

258
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,029
if I see a picture and you use your
LinkedIn picture for your clown dating

259
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:39,490
dot com picture i cant searching connect
those two

260
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,779
and go bob because known

261
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,190
it also bob CEO and

262
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,930
could be a really fun scandal and

263
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,990
another way to do it is Google Goggles
where you use the Google Goggles app and

264
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,490
you take a picture in it

265
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,910
searches the internet haven't had much
luck with this it

266
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,639
seen always pick something that it
really should know

267
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,820
it good with a physical location like if
you take a picture this Bridget figures

268
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,500
out the GPS coordinates and

269
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,100
tells you where it is in another fun
thing was curator dot com

270
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,240
so if you are you really bad day tre in
you

271
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,420
and sprinkle your PIII everywhere be
careful because

272
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,310
through de Turenne but they played don't
date /img /url dot com

273
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,970
in don't post about you

274
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,010
and no posts stories and and that one
particular southern

275
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,300
above comment was kinda interesting
because it was the same guy

276
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,579
and use Mary not to bore a strong age he
doesn't have a PHD and I think there

277
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,380
were 45

278
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,899
comment on that guy who with duping
everybody

279
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,029
and all these girls knew about to date
or dot com

280
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:57,670
so I would have by not going out with
husband

281
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,420
and you know whose name that's how I do
it I

282
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,409
I like to stay under the radar I have a
boyfriend now but you know

283
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:09,959
if I went back on again you know keep it
real hard to figure out who I am Google

284
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,760
Goggles moving to figure that out

285
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,280
0 this with the website I was trying to
find out this was no I'm not clone

286
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,730
dating

287
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,770
her spinal so if you have a real love
for your cat you're looking for that

288
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,740
special day

289
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,189
you can go to personal not comin

290
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,650
and find somebody that also has a
passion for their cat

291
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,500
maybe you don't want that connected and

292
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm LinkedIn really interesting but it's
not very in on a min

293
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,140
so you can set your LinkedIn if you
wanna see who's looking at you when you

294
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,160
have an unpaid account that means that

295
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,919
everybody else can also think when you
look at them and if you have a paid

296
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,400
account you can be a little more

297
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,640
anonymous I pop some recruiters after I
gave a speech one time and that that

298
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,590
okay

299
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,990
okay you have to watch out and I get
people who were on top secret project

300
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,190
oftentimes will put too much information
in their LinkedIn profile

301
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,990
so win the recruiters are trying to fit
through all of these resumes all notice

302
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,570
all of this information that

303
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,020
they don't feel like they should be
thing and because they may be looking at

304
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,720
twenty

305
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,830
top-secret applicant when you put all
that together you get to be a lot

306
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,020
so if you are a top secret applicant can
you please for the sake don't

307
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,799
society just tone down your of north on
LinkedIn

308
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,700
thank you and in this particular one is
just my page and

309
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,860
what it shows is that if they remember
it

310
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,970
some it shouldn't LinkedIn member
sometime that shows the someone and you

311

software industry for them Francisco Bay

312
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,770
Area

313
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,970
and third that was an intern I had and
she constantly looked at my

314
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,510
LinkedIn profile she had not read my
social engineering roles

315
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,110
but and another thing is m along with
with their baby fall

316
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,280
public so you can search a lot of things

317
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,070
in that case I wouldn't it a person
called the big bond

318
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,780
you may want to know what book your boss
is reading good maybe that kinda

319
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,010
tell you where his mind and

320
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,160
in that case it would like this box was
looking at

321
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,630
teaches you when to quit and the
obstacles between million a reality

322
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,130
that kinda or email business but you
know you might learn something really

323
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,640
interesting about your bought for a
friend

324
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,070
I A I gave this talk at a university
last week

325
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,130
and all the kids immediately logged in

326
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:38,650
made their wish list private and I have
a feeling that a reason

327
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,290
so I don't know because I have the
skills we all have the skills but

328
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,400
you know whatever I advertise and

329
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,549
and popular with my friend so

330
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,080
a I had a girlfriend and she was dating
this guy but many we got caught a cold

331
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,240
and aloof and he thought he might be
dating

332
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,600
and someone else so he asked me to look
up this person and I did they found the

333
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,210
email I found all that stuff and then I
found

334
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,750
like a LiveJournal he did when she did
18

335
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,740
and it had a quote like I never thought
I would voluntarily dress up share for

336
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,750
Halloween but it worked and it was warm

337
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,340
so I found out a certain friend of mine
ended up in the hit in the themes

338
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,350
well as BJ in no

339
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,010
what I did learn it I had a LiveJournal
account 19

340
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,429
I probably close that because it seems
like it could be regrettable

341
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,460
and not so friendly skies

342
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,910
and one is Google shows white

343
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,679
all the time live a lot businessman

344
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,470
executive and

345
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,400
the United upgrade list it public and I
mean it blowing up the lab three did for

346
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,679
the last name and

347
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,870
you know first they do that the first
name but if you were looking for someone

348
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,789
you would be able to find

349
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,039
maybe and if it was somebody like him
and the coen

350
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,950
right row who played a lot I could
probably if I really worked at it stock

351
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,049
in

352
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:10,240
I I would know where to start up in
Hawaii and I could just keep bouncing

353
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,240
off I could run an app that just
couldn't

354
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,039
constantly mind all the flight looking
for him on the upgrade land

355
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,200
and I don't know I don't know what
information we get but

356
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,299
been kinda freaky and scary and

357
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,380
the plane finder has anyone heard a bit
you see a plane in the sky in you and

358
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,770
put it up because the GPS location

359
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,870
and then it can actually tell you where
the plane and in

360
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,520
yo cordoned I can be fun I was flying
back from China one day

361
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,870
and a friend used it to find me so that
was kinda funny

362
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,460
and dark side it's not illegal but

363
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,340
kind kinda feel like you need a shower
afterward

364
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,539
and so the load Julio

365
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,640
pokey 0 BlockShopper in

366
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,640
your information is out there it was
your homeowner how much you spend for

367
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,190
your house

368
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,539
when it was sold to you bought it with
and

369
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,140
marriage records can be really hard to
find at least in the state of California

370
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,870
the figuring out if someone is married
is really difficult in

371
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,500
left your friend and mine was dating
that guy and

372
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,030
I love the date had to be done by 8:30
and they're only

373
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:27,690
your ruled should be and expecting that
he might be married she asked me did

374
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,179
the kind I hope and I couldn't find a
winning record but I did find a Zillow

375
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,830
record that showed he had purchased the
house recently with a woman

376
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,789
or like three years ago and using that
information she was able to find out

377
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:42,299
that

378
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,419
and he would not be single

379
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,429
in guy he had hoped for and then kinda
move darned

380
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,539
so if you there's really no way to get
billow

381
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,450
information of but it's out there and it
is the kind of interesting

382
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,710
and mug shot and

383
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,740
bringing criminal consortium the top
because you have to go to the

384
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,260
County that they were arrested and

385
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,669
so but you can go in your hometown
county and start searching for people

386
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,990
that can kinda be interesting it gives
you all the details although the police

387
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,179
report

388
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,910
most be things aren't feel you can learn
a lot of information very quickly

389
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,919
and and likely in my case it turns out
my friends and family have remarkably

390
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,960
clean record

391
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,049
and and that kinda what it looks like

392
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,059
somebody failed to appear to clean it
with the DOJ aimed

393
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,110
another one is the Megans law offender
light out this is good if you're a

394
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,990
female

395
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,169
and you're looking for helping it'll
tell you where all of the sexual

396
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,270
offenders were in your area

397
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,480
and can be useful

398
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,080
in third didn't begin

399
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,659
this is a good way of finding PIII on
the Internet in cloud-based

400
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,850
storage so if your social security
numbers out there

401
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,380
or your medical record or any other
stuff within the cloud

402
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,360
created by thoughts in lieu which is the
consultancy firm

403
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,640
and it kinda good I haven't had a lot of
luck with that my I don't know if I'm

404
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,820
not using it right if it's really flow

405
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,190
in but I like the idea and the seem to
keep

406
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,270
making new version so I'm really hopeful
that it will get better

407
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:33,450
and

408
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,799
yes I had that worry which is why I
haven't done it extensively

409
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,690
and it kinda worry people had back in
the day when everybody wanted their own

410
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,940
domain name and so they were afraid just
by

411
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,150
searching for the domain name somebody
else would take it

412
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,280
and I think that a still a valid fear
and

413
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,429
a when you posted 16 you still want it
to be available at forty

414
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,120
is probably more true to your kid who
grew up in the fiber age and

415
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,059
though thing and and you want to have to
ever justify your purchases from twenty

416
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:05,850
years ago

417
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,919
and I personally don't

418
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,530
so what can you do and

419
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,620
don't do them for the things on your
main account

420
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,200
close out account regularly don't you
though of for tricky situation

421
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,789
single sign-on solution can be bad I
don't use those at all

422
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:32,630
%uh remove yourself from smoky oak
periodically Google yourself in

423
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,570
troubled the countdown and delete them
and

424
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:43,570
and and he questioned

425
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,799
I'm just because you start I know I i've
had

426
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,270
developers bringing that to me that the
information should be contained and

427
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,240
brought in

428
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,970
I'm kinda paranoid I think that somehow
bill share information

429
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,880
are more then and the architecture sound

430
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,880
just depend

431
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,159
yeah I know they came to a lot though
other than taking the blog

432
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,279
and I doubt but that both love you can

433
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:22,279
are welcome to donate for that are
cupcake for that and

434
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:31,810
and

435
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,860
and

436
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,890
good that definitely a cupcake where the
question

437
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,530
and yet it is it's just maybe not
something you wanna share

438
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,320
if an employer decided to look for you
yet

439
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,670
and

440
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,820
personal money but so and

441
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,000
misinformation that's a great idea just
loading the world down with all these

442
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,900
mid

443
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,790
made back to view putting what the
people you really don't know if you put

444
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,510
a lot of them

445
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,580
maple creek without a lot of people will
like that even though they don't know

446
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:06,990
you

447
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,530
because they want to be polite and

448
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,650
so you can you can build the fall world
and that's another way of saying an

449
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,790
on-demand

450
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,370
so also I come pick where the question
if your interest and

451
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:27,370
any other questioned

452
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,350
and

453
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,910
in

454
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,140
in

455
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,210
and

456
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,150
in

457
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,270
and I you like it I'm

458

don't know anything it's a good question

463
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,570
but I don't know any way to prevent
other people with the same name from

464
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:17,570
behaving and

465

yeah you can find out people three years
and

549
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,050
in

550
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,250
it

551
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,760
and

552
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,910
and

553
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,310
and

554
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,500
it

555
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,650
and

556
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,360
in

557
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,050
and

558
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,500
and

559
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,330
and yet

560
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,350
and rate you may be paying someone is
making it worse

561
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:55,350
in and

562
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,310
bitbop report is well known for not
removing anything

563
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,510
including well-known fault thing I think
you can pay

564
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,930
and sector eight hundred dollars to have
arbitration

565
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,240
where you may get it removed and so
that's one other big money revenue and

566
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,060
at that point of the donor a cupcake 30
in the back

567
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:31,060
