limited to from amount resources and
you're holding did

118
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,639
outcome the area voting authority and
you

119
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,550
if we have a very mall

120

123
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,520
some a good thing Claire heaven

124
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,840
the method are repo

125

the for the BB wild-card

126
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,539
you on a imagined out we

agenda garland up your child which
payload

128
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,949
or we could up

129
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,110
wild-card get more

130
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,909
there were so red

131
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,210
both could be very interesting

132
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,830
on ectopic typeof red ob

133
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,289
from new layer all about where than that

134
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,680
heartbeat the political on

135
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,080
example could be I think too many things
on

136

on a car or e-commerce website

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,250
and then up obligation would be called
up by

138
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,080
gonna copper or low-down torque rod

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,850
you other example logging

140
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,200
mod I mean no are

141
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,360
quoting loading them to look to mod some

142
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,930
run out of paper from what you

143
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,000
our proposed method now nothing about
the

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,660
not wanna goal that with this mention it
Nov 10

145
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,640
the Lothar Floyd the the for florid

146
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,870
also get the time up

147
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,230
on be not trying to exalt the the

148
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,760
magical 20 he connection the mid

149
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,279
not note the intention

150
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,370
a so what we think is your original
consumption development

151
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,630
go by then the sure he

152
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,230
client you know long one

153
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,910
notable on client meeting with no
running of the

154
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,310
not trying to render think is a
equipment and there were

155
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,829
need gonna offer more everything

156
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,990
help being equal know what we propose a

157
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,370
regular get blog for those who remember
the

158
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,550
coming from the repeal internet no

159
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,040
that Roman on

160
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,260
what we do is outcome or knowledge
before you go on blind

161
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,690
the who want to get a quid

162
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,300
right go

163
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,110
from here oh the the method

164
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,490
Time Machine idea that sweet had heard
the good

165

166
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,760
would load Bowl girl and on the computer
then

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,020
so this is the same kind of idea you

168
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,450
for you analyze the word site and you

169
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,500
identified the resources that are for

170
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
what we call have and for

171
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,050
you start wedding then with those
especially those resources and

172
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,360
hoping that that could bring them work
who

173
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,750
the ID is actually very simple ways I
drew

174
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,290
over the web site we gather all the
resource almost home

175
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,810
for example and then that gives us a
little update

176
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,130
and when use the and

177
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,660
known that Michael Cera the that the who
had to relocate

178
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,740
review peak to a measurement

179
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,020
take the No the rear and the

180
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,029
we that's how we do part call Crime

181
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,380
resources your so

182
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,600
for example this is a kind of a website

183
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,959
you know you said typically some
resources are caught summer

184
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,600
lower but the there there are grouped in
some categories

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
so the group good on the moon your

186
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,890
lead the the school resources

187
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,940
and mean they are significantly slower
than the

188
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,420
majority of other resources so repairs
order

189
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,640
good so

190
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,070
are the described the formal method
kinda fees

191
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,199
we measure would take a measurement
overall resources

192
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,250
ok a website and we help with the new

193
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,860
was elected to me the Metro Center and

194
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,770
and we cope with the standard deviation
goes loses

195
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,220
who me the resort

196
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,810
measurement that he's not across 29

197
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,899
know that fluctuate be some other

198
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,540
attaching pics weeks or something and
the

199
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,029
so then we just sort the resources by
their you

200
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,170
and the we hard working at the pope over
those

201
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,910
on who all did but

202
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,000
this lined them for some so no

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
second grounded you in

204
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,240
be who in is the Pope and

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,800
guy you're in the hood rocketed

206
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,160
the you good

207
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,910
who sleepers so here

208
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,180
this example I'm running the tool
against the local legal

209
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,270
website and the specified that from the
cold number

210
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,380
murder period and for

211
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,040
with the your term sorted by their

212
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,260
good truck goes ok generate an XML real
quick we

213
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,459
let the big smile because and the pit
some other who

214
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,930
Vancouver people can come up with a
clever ways you speaker

215
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,380
here we see the measurement and
measurement data

216
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,180
for example the new for download time

217
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,970
and the under division so the ones that
have higher undergoes you can become

218
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,100
report

219
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,430
and the school who has abuse it who and

220
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,459
measured by carton onlookers so you can
actually very

221
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:57,290
resources Weibel occurred period that
will give you better here

222
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,689
what-have-you resources on

223
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:04,120
because hmm the herd

224
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,189
wire school loom

225
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:11,170
the realization Texas AP that the lows
based on the

226
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,150
know that was generated by the who you
throws part

227
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,329
and so Turk notice under and with the
resources

228
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,339
are who their four quadrants here and
the pope who could run

229
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,730
her resources that are have and

230
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,100
the dhahran reliably measured so we
program were

231
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,000
was good we concentrate on the I'm
broken left the cauldron

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,279
which are school resources and they're
consistently low

233
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,680
so these lose a reserve it for you

234
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,949
who find the one that we called her you
concentrate

235
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,740
the quadrant and the closer to do or use
the resources

236
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,350
the better or worst didn't perform

237
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,260
terms murder

238
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,870
so yeah we can just concentrate on

239
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,240
pope 10 percent of these resources and

240
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,770
part posting those on there is another

241
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,529
and realization method that who on

242
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,970
accord this is you know gramm his book
language:

243
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,589
you can read the rock ok the website

244
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,930
and do mind who this is right now is not
very very useful

245
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,390
but again future someone might fun some
you who were

246
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,470
maybe highlight the no had the resources
somehow

247
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,680
so who won once you have guesses about
the resort

248
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,050
redwood can be done using this who and

249
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,160
third weekend are

250
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,360
between for example right now I'm run
because been for

251
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,760
congressman and Concord

252
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,329
and that decided in the URL that how
many measurement

253
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,779
Peyton who come back would resources
that

254
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,600
things that who tested recorder

255
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,880
just by looking at least you can part
having day

256
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,130
years for example Yayo resources low

257
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,620
maybe had to do be axis thats wat

258
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,829
lower than you know just about cool

259
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:14,819
of so you start getting an idea

260
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:18,140
work to do the woman we don't know who
with who

261
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,040
3x know that it your by the who can be
paid back into the coup

262
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,140
who and has United

263
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,459
yes the resources we heard who you

264
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,370
theme isn't parameter your big similar

265
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,370
and then who run the test again rosewood

266
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,529
more number of cold and who were

267
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,880
the no previously it was on

268
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,430
the measurement was time now we went
back to

269
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,350
quill who when

270
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,790
all this person so you the

271
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,199
performers agreed that is that be the
guest was right

272
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,870
this was really a heavy resource other
ways you

273
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,919
mean be he leaves and resort
presentation may be caused by you

274
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,100
and load balancer something so

275
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,939
be these who love those who come

276
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,860
come up with a bit guesses who Lee
what's happened here so

277
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,110
was heart school the for

278
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,290
asymmetry your on

279
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,840
hyper cuz work so there are three screws
I

280
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,130
separated into three screen %uh the top
screws

281
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,669
to arm cope come and gone whatsoever

282
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,169
and the party web server honor records
in

283
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,450
and the book come right one lose

284
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,580
the coke command running on mine

285
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,980
the right now it was about 9 percent CPU

286
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,790
and beaches use was done would be
recording soaker

287
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,669
so the record in Co Cork 9 persecutor

288
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,090
who and the boy who lived on the moon
run Sun

289
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,130
does to kinda first

290
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,429
the server so

291
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,520
woohoo that yeah with a

292
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,820
server right now has your CPU load and

293
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,460
I'm launching the who through times

294
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,560
and the load on the server climbs up to
8

295
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,649
eighty percent and load on my plan

296
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:28,880
whose only 29 percent which is the

297
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,950
as login with think the know the
estimates with nature demonstrate yes it

298
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,409
certainly

299
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:36,810
rupees not from your load on the ferry 9

300
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,149
in earlier

301
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:43,179
so me overwhelming and you

302
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,090
you achieve these play carefully
selecting

303
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,570
the URL who attack rather than

304
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,700
you were tightened everything

305
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,429
and I'm saying the pack because it could
be also replaced by test because

306
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,070
the you know this is valuable for
testing as well

307
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,300
so the this is an example

308
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,530
husband who on

309
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,060
the them this year that was through

310
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,830
again his concrete pipe and then the

311
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,010
their work through love the cool one

312
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,200
was one does only 100 pro and

313
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,520
you can't wait to see that the server
performance degrades over time

314
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,240
and week who did you know the research
was

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,960
was done was get actually correct

316
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,980
in included

317
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,050
Oro in

318
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,090
we didn't want to reinvent the wheel
overlooked that

319
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,540
other cool both you up other guy being

320
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,399
are who the in to see more about

321
00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:01,780
from the helping prospective from cool
who the

322
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,790
that the filling out these like a the
for ruling elite

323
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,139
good HTTP about nano

324
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:12,200
though you really numba those

325
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,669
doubt really do that same I could

326
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,060
functionality is the call that be
prevented

327

really hard in who defend

348
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,870
again you know about again

349
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,540
so from some being could be done

350
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,010
the layer from though and not wanna the

351
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,330
in I the warm just get

352
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,560
lot there are wat you can

353
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,800
wide we did long load balancer

354
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,950
would be one of the would

355
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,510
proposition long commute our who

356
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,510
you go what the problem in the first
place

357
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,830
good eliminate the

358
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,840
for all in will go through

359
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,360
couple a pot configuration up at
Molineux

360
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,030
about who the a good solution

361
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,190
and then we would and

362
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,659
very good hood

363
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,169
on you more security protection

364
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:35,250
make any that we were the implemented

365
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,560
but although the again bill

366
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,860
muted the attacked her good

367

very or cool you know he's being

368
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,159
he's dealing with it that than that
being protected

369
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,129
10 wanna be about mission

370
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:57,240
met the said holding the problem over

371
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,460
holding who Leona

372
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,179
in right in

373
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,990
order of allow on

374
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,970
of go come back good

375
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,070
go look about for usually

376
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,090
are a who'd for

377
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,320
the because there are rate me for that

378
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,860

Ron our pool or any other cool figure
out what

455
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,500
are basically use you do the to a who
figure out with other is

456
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,559
all on

457
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,150
you take them out for that BB and also

orbit you think that the Harker I'm you
the cool

463
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,330
the figure out what will happen to

464
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,630
on me no idea Walby we weren't will be

465
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,840
be or who the we would

466
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,140
generate from home the

467
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,490
while for about model

468
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,899
that would protect or for a tip for the

469
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:14,360
a the on we gone even know what

470
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,309
to good depends on your situation so you
can't really

471
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:22,700
just you were the relief

472
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,840
/url we up

473
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,220
you gonna show you the concrete p.m. et
and

474
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,080
the orwell we we with burning

475
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,340
hop right is over and over

476
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,789
and we'd the tried who do the same thing

477
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:45,390
but provide some protection and you
what's happening

478
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,409
the baseline wuv you on I'm thinking war

479
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:53,350
like one by running and power where

480
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:59,350
you percent to do utilization on the
client machine

481
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,419
there were ninety-eight percent very
high and there were

482
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,580
struggling though

483
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,270
what you think on there are a pad
conflagration

484
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,700
directive nothing could be done you back

485
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,260
and your something that would be
grateful upgrade will be grateful

486
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,289
that make saw think model your weekend

487
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:25,690
provided about parenthood the decision
on people are

488
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,730
in your book holder bolt

489
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,399
then we pride going through some more
dual

490
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,080
that will be helpful more security

00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:23,359
there were but ubiquitinated

547
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,440
or would mold or apart for

548
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,330
and applied green and I'm regarded

549
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,620
over there that the world

550
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,210
greenery within it'd work in

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,710
the more motivated supermen

552
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:48,640

I've more these making sure when you

632
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,150
3 more you become more week min

633
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,400
he no UAW arbitrary related

634
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,470
the forefront you know really going

635
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,580
down people the there were me

636
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,070
orwell in but court both

637
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,500
resources that are gonna be U Haul

638
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:46,500
the whole but I'm right away we wanted

639
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,790
you know we don't really care about
going on I mean we don't presume

640
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:04,790
not be or 9 I'm we looked too low good

641
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,830
in writer good that's kinda the

642
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,590
this who the

643
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,400
you these so and that's why when you
take over all were

644
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,830
baseline rope retire its a great you
know that

645
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,030
some the the some

646
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,300
rule your iPod some them normal and

647
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,090
no majority of them are maybe at the
pages maybe some resources and

648
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:41,030
you know if this and what not and come
are market rooms

649
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,820
lower so then there's you further
investigation why is this happening so

650
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,390
this is what the school with trying to
do who kind

651
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,640
throw away the majority and allow you to
concentrate on that

652
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,640
10 percent to recover interested

653
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,940
for who cannot throughout and vision

654
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,370
on the I think right now and given

655
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,580
